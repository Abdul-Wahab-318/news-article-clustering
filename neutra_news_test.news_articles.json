  "content": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir has stated weakening the armed forces is tantamount to weakening the country, pledging that the military will not allow let its sacrifices to go in vain.  “We emerge as a strong nation after trial and tribulations. To weaken Pakistan's armed forces is tantamount to weakening the country itself.\" He stated this while addressing the Azadi Parade at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul on the eve of Independence Day late Tuesday. The parade was held at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) Kakul to mark the 78th Independence Day. The army chief said armed forces will not let sacrifices of their martyrs to go waste and added that the nation's unwavering trust in the Pakistan Army is the military's most valuable asset. “Neither any negative force has ever been able to weaken this relationship of trust and love nor can it do so in future,” he said adding that the armed forces have taken an oath to defend the country internally and externally. Referring to the crises being faced by the country, the COAS said: “Historically, we as a nation have always emerged stronger after every hardship.” Mutual trust between the nation and the armed forces played key role in this regard, he added. The army chief was of the view that internal conflicts and chaos weakened the country and paved the way for external aggression.    “Pakistan came into being to stand out among the comity of nations. Pakistan is a fait accompli and it cannot be undone,” the army chief stated. Gen Munir said the country's people “are living as a free nation owing to the martyrs' sacrifices”. Gen Munir said that the base of our national consciousness is the ideology of Pakistan, which stands on the two-nation theory. “May the Almighty Allah grant us the courage and strength to defend the country and make it a successful and great example for future generations.” The army chief said that the two-nation theory provided an opportunity to the Muslims of the subcontinent to have separate identity, culture and civilization. The COAS said the menace of terrorism was once again rearing head in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to the anti-state activities of “Fitna-ul-Khawarij”.  In a move to shift its war on terror from a physical to an ideological front, the government last month categorised the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as “Fitna ul-Khawarij”. Gen Munir said he had earlier said about the fitna that \"If you do not follow the Sharia and the Constitution of Pakistan, then we also do not consider you as a Pakistani”. Lauding the sacrifices rendered by the people in KP, the COAS said: “The entire nation salutes them and is indebted to them.” Lauding the brotherly countries for their continuous economic and moral support on international forums, the army chief remarked: “We are grateful to China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey, who always support Pakistan in every difficult time.” In a strong and clear message to Pakistan’s enemies, the COAS said: “Whether it is conventional or unconventional war, dynamic or proactive war strategy, our response will be swift and painful.” Moving on to Kashmir issue, the army chief reiterated Pakistan's moral, political and diplomatic support to the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their legitimate struggle for right to self-determination. The army chief was the chief guest of the Azadi Parade ceremony. The cadets of the Pakistan Military Academy presented a spectacular demonstration of their skills in the drill parade. On this occasion, a special tribute was presented to the martyrs of the land."

  "content": "  ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday hosted a lavish dinner for the country’s pride and ace javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem, who won a gold medal at Paris Olympics 2024. In the final quest of the Paris Olympics 2024, Nadeem lauched a massive javelin throw of 92.97-metre and secured the first-ever individual gold medal in Olympics for Pakistan, maiden athletics and first gold in any discipline in the last 40 years.

Moreover, the premier also announced a sports endowment fund worth Rs1 million for the prosperity of the players, needs of the retired players and provision of better training opportunities for them. Addressing the event, Arshad expressed gratitude towards his family and the nation for their prayers, which he said had enabled him to break the Olympic record for the javelin throw event. He also thanked public for the welcome upon his arrival to Pakistan, saying it was “even more so than my medal”. Arshad pledged to \"train fully for all upcoming competitions\" and make another world record.  Earlier, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar acorded a warm welcome to Nadeem and his family, who arrived in Islamabad on a charter plane, at the Nur Khan Airbase. Nadeem's entourage were given state protocol.  Talking to the media on the occasion, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, who received Nadeem, said that the gold medallist is a national hero and a state guest.  He said that besides the banquet hosted at the PM House in Arshad's honour, the athlete has been invited to the main Independence Day ceremony, where he would unfurl the Pakistani flag alongside PM Shehbaz in the flag hoisting event.

  "content": "    Reacting to the arrest of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid by the military, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has said that the retired general should face trial if he has committed any wrongdoing.  A day earlier, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced that  the former ISI chief was taken into custody over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society in line with the orders of the Supreme Court. \"A detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" read the ISPR's statement. Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Gandapur remarked that Faiz's arrest is a part of the army's internal affairs and the party refrained from speaking about such matters.  However, he underscored the need for \"transparency of trial\" for everyone. It is being reported, he further said, that the former spy master victimised someone while still holding his official position.  Commenting on the development, Independent Senator Faisal Vawada and Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah yesterday linked the former spymaster with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the May 9 incidents.  Vawda had told Geo News that the issue of the former general arrest would follow through and lead the May 9 matter to arrive at its logical conclusion. He also predicted the consequences of the August 12 step for the PTI leaders in the coming days.  The May 9 events refer to violent protests broke out in the country following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last year in a corruption case. The violent attacks saw government buildings and military installations including Rawalpindi's General Headquarters (GHQ) and Lahore Corps Commander's House being vandalised by mobs. The former ruling party has distanced itself from the violent protests with its jailed founder Imran Khan recently stating that he was ready to apologise if PTI activists were found involved in the riots.   Referring to his arrest, Chief Minister Gandapur also urged the court to summon him to know \"what he was being pressurised to say\" in custody before the May 9 violent protests.    \"Being an eyewitness, I can tell the court about what the plan was and what steps were taken ahead of May 9,\" he said, claiming that the mayhem following the party founder's arrest was pre-planned.

The vice chancellor, who is the spouse of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Dr Asim Hussain, remained unscathed in the attack as she had not yet got inside the car,  a spokesperson of Dawood University of Engineering and Technology said. Talking about the incident, Dr Samreen revealed that she had been visiting a college in Orangi Town for the Independence Day celebrations for the last two days. \"I visited a college in Orangi [Town] for tomorrow's celebration. Unidentified men barged into the college's premises and opened fire at the car,\" she stated. The bullet hit the vehicle's radiator, while Samreen rushed back inside the school. Meanwhile, police also reached the spot.  West Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irfan Baloch said the attack could be a \"robbery bid\". He, however, said that it would be premature to comment on the nature of the attack.  Taking notice of the matter, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori expressed concern over the attack on Dr Samreen and sought the report from the additional inspector general. He said that the elements involved in the attack will be brought to justice.  It may be noted that Dr Samreen is a Tamgha-e-Imtiaz recipient."

  "content": "    ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has expressed grave concerns over the reports of recurring incidents of theft and illicit sale of nuclear and other radioactive materials in India, reiterating the call for independent probe into such incidents.   \"Pakistan is gravely concerned at the reports of recurring incidents of theft and illicit sale of nuclear and other radioactive materials in India. In the latest incident, a gang of individuals were found in illegal possession of a highly radioactive and toxic substance Californium, worth $100 million in quantity,\" Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said this in response to a question on Tuesday.  The Indian media reported last week about the arrest of another gang possessing a highly radioactive and toxic substance Californium. Islamabad demanded New Delhi conduct a probe into the frequent instances of “theft and illicit sale” of nuclear and other radioactive materials in India. \"Three incidents of theft of Californium were also reported in 2021,\" the FO spokesperson said, adding that five individuals with a radioactive device reportedly stolen from Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) were also found from Dehradun last month.  Islamabad also called into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive substances, stressing that these incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India.  After the substance was seized from the smugglers, the Indian authorities informed the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) — the central authority responsible for overseeing nuclear materials in India — to step in for a thorough investigation, given the critical nature of the substance, according to NDTV.  In its reaction, Islamabad reiterated its call for a thorough investigation of these incidents and for adequate measures to prevent their recurrence. \"The international community seeks an earnest disclosure from the Indian authorities as to how a sealed Radioactive Source (SRS) material, like Californium, was in the possession of the apprehended individuals. It is dangerous for such sensitive material in India to routinely be found in the wrong hands,\" the FO statement added.  On May 5, 2021, two individuals were arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) for illegally carrying 7.1 kilogrammes of natural uranium. Just a month later, the Indian police arrested seven persons from different areas of Jharkhand and recovered six kilogrammes of uranium from their custody.  A kilogramme of uranium sells for around $2.1 million in the global market."

  "content": " Days after his party deferred its two-week-long Rawalpindi sit-in, Jamaat-e-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has announced another protest, saying that the JI would give a call for peaceful protest by joining hands with trader groups. \"Consultations are underway with traders. We have several options [....] Will call for peaceful demonstrations together with trade bodies,\" Naeem said while speaking to the media in Islamabad on Tuesday. The fresh protests' announcement comes after the party postponed its 14-day long sit-in last week following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers.  \"We are deferring and not ending the sit-in,\" the JI chief said while warning that they would stage a sit-in again if the government didn't go through with their agreement. The announcement came after the JI delegation led by Liaquat Baloch held multiple rounds of talks with the government team which eventually culminated in an agreement signed by Information Minister Ataullah Tarar and Interior Minister Moshin Naqvi. Continuing on in his presser today, Hafiz Naeem fired a broadside at the ruling elite for worsening the law and order situation in the country. \"There is no peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Bandits rule in Sindh [whereas] Punjab's situation has also worsened that before,\" the politician said while calling on the rulers to improve the law and order situation. Lamenting the country's prevailing economic situation and its effects on the masses, the JI chief noted that 80% of the youth don't want to live in the country. Commenting on the burden on the inflation-weary masses, the politico said that no one was opposed to broadening the tax net, however, he lamented that taxes were being imposed on the people and further highlighted the concerns of the traders and industrialists. Calling for slashing the taxes imposed on the salaried class, Naeem warned that the party would once again take to the streets if the government failed to implement the agreement with them. \"The government has 40 days left [...] we have several options [to hold] protests,\" he added."

  "content": "A wanted terrorist of the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), a banned militant organisation, has been killed by his own accomplice, security sources told Geo News on Tuesday. According to the sources, the terrorist — Shambeen alias Shahak — was involved in several terrorist activities including attacks on forces. Shambeen alias Shahak was involved in attacks on forces as well as the killing of former members who had surrendered. The killed terrorists was directly involved in numerous attacks on security forces in Balochistan.  Responding to a question about whether his killing points towards internal fights between the militant groups, Brigadier (retd) Waqar Hassan told Geo News that these terrorist organisations operating in Pakistan, whether they are doing so in the name of Islam or as nationalist groups, are all basically \"criminal mafia\" and there is no ideology. It is, he added, mainly to create chaos and extortion of money. \"The infighting has been going on for a long time,\" he said, detailing the surrenders made by ex-members of banned militant organisations, Gulzar Imam Shambay and Sarfraz Bangulzai last year. The cracks within these organisations are a result of our intelligence's efforts and infighting due to money.  \"The main reason for infighting is the division of money given to them as funds,\" he said. These organisations will hopefully stop operating if the intensity of infighting increases. Balochistan, which remains a target of terrorist activities, has witnessed several attacks on civilians and security forces. Among the 92% fatalities recorded as a result of terrorist attacks, the province has suffered 25% of all deaths in the second quarter of 2024, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw 67% lives lost to terrorism."

  "content": "KARACHI/PESHAWAR: As various parts of Pakistan continue to remain under the influence of the monsoon spell, the country's financial hub is also expected to receive light to moderate rain in the next 24 hours. With a 10-kilometre wind blowing from the west, the city's maximum temperature, as per the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), is likely to reach 32°C.  The humidity level currently stands at 89% whereas the minimum temperature in the metropolis has been recorded at 27.5°C. Karachi has experienced light rain spells in recent weeks which have turned the weather pleasant after citizens were left sweltering in extreme heat last month. \"Light rain may occur in Karachi due to clouds. There may be moderate rain at a few places,\" remarked weather expert Jawad Memon. He added that a light sea breeze is currently blowing in Karachi and there is a chance of rain in the city's northeastern areas after noon. Furthermore, the PMD has said that monsoon winds will enter East Sindh from August 16 resulting in likely thundershowers in Karachi, Ghotki, and Sukkur between August 16 and 19. There is also a chance of thundershowers in Mirpurkhas, Umarkot, Sanghar and Thatta, the weather department added. A day earlier, the Met Office had forecast rains in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and other areas of Punjab from Wednesday (tomorrow) till August 18. Rain along with strong winds has been predicted in Murree, Galyat, Chakwal, Gujrat and Gujranwala. Apart from these areas, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Sahiwal, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara and Pakpattan will also experience rain showers, said the government body.

I went with my then co-chair, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,\" he said.

  "content": "   After the military arrested former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that the ex-spymaster was involved in the political events following his retirement from the military in November 2022.   Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', the defence minister said on Monday: \"Post his [Faiz] retirement, the events that unraveled on the political scene, Gen sahab definitely had a hand in it.\" \"Knowing him a little bit, he never refrains from muddling the waters. Especially [in Faiz's case] a person who has exercised unlimited power and he has to take the back seat,\" he added.  Responding to a question regarding the former ISI director general's (DG) purported involvement in the May 9 events, Asif said that if the reports are true then Lt Gen (retd) Faiz is not alone in this as he \"would have been providing some logistics, using his experience to define the targets to cause bigger damage\". \"We can say he [Faiz] had a role of strategic adviser in the May 9 events. I can't say that with certainty but the events and circumstances are pointing towards him,\" he added.  Asif said Lt Gen (retd) Faiz and former army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa had very deep personal ties as their fathers-in-law were extremely close.  \"This made their bond impregnable,\" the minister asserted.  In a major development earlier today, the ex-ISI chief was taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. Consequently, the military's media wing said appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. It added that multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established against the former general, who also served as Peshawar corps commander. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" the ISPR said in the communique. The arrest was made in connection with a petition filed by a housing society's chief executive officer (CEO) in the Supreme Court last year, wherein the former ISI director general (DG) was accused of misusing his authority and violating the Army Act."

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated on Monday that the federal government will provide one million smartphones, tablets, and laptops to top-performing students across the country, including those from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and remote areas of Balochistan while speaking at an event marking the International Day of Youth. Speaking at an event marking the International Day of Youth, organised by the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, he recalled his service as chief minister of Punjab under the leadership of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif.  The prime minister said he aimed to provide opportunities for the youth to change the country’s destiny as prime minister. He added that each province has its separate programmes to support the students. Moreover, he pledged to allocate ample resources to the nation’s youth to help transform the country into a thriving, developed nation. “The country’s youth have the potential to elevate the nation to new heights, if given access to modern education and resources,” he added. The premier expressed his vision of equipping talented youth with modern education, information technology, and artificial intelligence to spark a revolution in the country, similar to the progress seen in China.  He then highlighted his previous efforts in providing modern facilities to students at Danish Schools. He also lamented that despite having abundant resources and 77 years of independence, the country remains heavily burdened by debt. It was also noted by him that extreme poverty prevents many from affording basic needs, such as arranging marriages for their daughters, while the country’s elite class enjoys significant privileges. Additionally, the prime minister announced that he will personally fund the education of 1,000 agricultural graduates in China, aiming to equip them with modern technology to boost agri production. Huawei has also committed to sending 200,000 youth for IT training and advanced education, he said adding that he will unveil a comprehensive development plan for the country on August 14. He further stated that nothing was impossible in this world and emphasised the need to progress by learning from past mistakes. He assured that the country’s hockey will be revived.  Praising javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem, the PM noted that he had won a gold medal for the country after a gap of 40 years. At the beginning of the event, the prime minister officially launched several key initiatives, including the Commonwealth Youth Alliance Secretariat in Islamabad, the Digital Learning Portal, the PM Green Youth Movement, and the AI for Youth Programme, which offers Intel-certified skills to young people.  Other initiatives included Smart Youth, Smart Pakistan, and the distribution of one million tablets and mobile phones to high-achieving intermediate students. He also announced the registration of the National Volunteer Corps. Later, the prime minister presented awards to successful young entrepreneurs."

  "content": "    KARACHI: Former prime minister and top leader of the newly launched political party Awam Pakistan Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that holding polls anew will not solve problems faced by the country and urged the army chief, chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) and politicians to find a way out.  \"Even fresh polls won't solve the problems in the country. Army chief, CJP and politicians should sit together and determine a way to run the country,\" he said while speaking to journalists outside an accountability court on Monday.  It may be noted that political rivals of the ruling coalition — Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) — have time and again called for new elections.  Political parties including Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F), Jamat-e-Islami (JI) alleged vote rigging, interference, and manipulation of the poll results in the February 8 elections. Abbasi's statement about the fresh polls came after the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) withdrew a reference against the ex-premier. Referring to the graft reference pertaining to illegal appointments in Pakistan State Oil (PSO), the ex-premier said that the statement of only a single witness was recorded against him in four years.  He said that the reference was not against corruption and was made in misuse of powers by the anti-graft body.  Abbasi went on to say that \"the sooner NAB is abolished the better it would be for the country\".  \"Such cases are started under political engineering. Today is a day to celebrate as the court exonerated us from the charges,\" he added.  The former PM and others were accused of illegally appointing a former managing director of PSO, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer, in a supplementary reference filed in 2020 with the LNG terminal case.  An accountability court in Karachi acquitted Abbasi and others in the LNG case in April this year."

  "content": "Independent Senator Faisal Vawda has linked the arrest of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid by the military with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), saying that the arrest is just a beginning with many more to come.    The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced the arrest of the former ISI chief, saying that he was taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said.    The ISPR said appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. Giving his reaction to the development, Senator Vawda said: \"This is just the beginning; many big figures are about to fall.\"  Terming the development as \"excellent decision\" taken for the sake of the country, Vawda said whoever caused any harm to the country will be held accountable. \"The process of accountability will be seen in the country,\" he noted. he also claimed that the PTI and the former spy chief are two sides of the same coin, claiming that the incarcerated party founder Imran Khan and his party will face the music in the coming days.  The former PTI leader underscored the need for everyone to let institutions to do their official work. The army's surprise action against the former ISI boss has left the PTI “politically orphan,” Vawda added. Meantime, Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah also welcomed Hamid's arrest, saying the step will help enhance the Pakistan Army's goodwill and respect.  The process of court martial will make headway as per the military's law, he said, adding that the former general was one of the signatories of the Faizabad sit-in agreement.  He said that people were manipulated to stage the Faizabad sit-in and Hamid had a role in this, adding that the inquiry will expose all the facts in this regard.  Commenting on the charges mentioned by the ISPR in connection with today's arrest of the former spy chief, the politico said that the Supreme Court gave its ruling on the petition filed by the housing society owner and the inquiry was also held into the allegations against the former spy chief.  \"Multiple irregularities must have been found in this regard,\" he said, asking to sticking to the ISPR's statement in the matter."

  "content": "Four soldiers were martyred while six terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between the miscreants and the security forces in South Waziristan, a statement issued by the military's media affairs wing said late Tuesday night. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR): “On night 12/ 13 August 2024, fire exchange took place between the security forces and Khwarij in South Waziristan District.” “Resultantly, six Khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops.” However, during the intense fire exchange, four soldiers — Havildar Nisar Hussain, 34, resident of District Kurram; Naik Rashid Gul, 34, resident of District Kurram; Naik Irfan Ullah Khan, 30, resident of District Lakki Marwat and Sepoy Usman Rafaqat, 21, resident of District Haripur — having fought gallantly embraced Shahadat. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other “Kharji” found in the area as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism. “Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the military’s media wing added. Following the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has experienced a tidal wave of terrorist attacks on security forces, particularly in provinces bordering the neighbouring country, with militants employing advanced weaponry and equipment. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), Annual Security report, during the second quarter of the current year, Pakistan witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terror operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counterterrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Wednesday that he would soon share \"good news\" with the nation regarding a reduction in electricity prices and will also outline a new economic plan. Pakistanis have been receiving inflated bills for months now as the government keeps increasing prices to cut the power debt as well as implement conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"Today, there is inflation. People are worried about electricity bills and other problems. However, if not all is good in the country, not all is bad,\" the prime minister said during an event in Islamabad held to mark the 77th Independence Day. The premier said Pakistan's industries cannot prosper and exports cannot increase without a reduction in electricity bills, adding that he will address the nation in a few days and present a five-year economic plan. A day earlier, PM Shehbaz said the government was focused on providing low-cost electricity as it was \"inevitable\" to steer the country out of prevailing crisis.  “Our sole focus is to reduce power prices to provide relief to domestic consumers, agriculture, industry, exports and business sectors. This is inevitable to steer the economy of prevailing issues. The competitiveness of exports is linked with cheap electricity,” he said.  Moreover, The News had reported that the government was making plans for rationalising power tariffs through different proposals including slashing allocation of development budget at federal and provincial levels. It was revealed that the government is also working on closing down domestic independent power producers (IPPs) belonging to the government and private sectors. However, the IMF has not yet granted its endorsement for the power rationalisation plan, according to the sources. PM Shehbaz also called low-cost electricity and efficient power transmission system the major factors for a stable economy. The federal government also had last week struck an agreement with the Jamaat-e-Islami, in which it agreed to form a task force aimed at addressing issues related to IPPs, reducing electricity bills, and lowering taxes on the salaried class."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The 77th Independence Day is being celebrated with a renewed pledge to work with the spirit of Pakistan Movement to make the country a true Islamic welfare state. The day dawned with a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute in the provincial headquarters. Special prayers were offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country.  The main event of the celebrations was a national flag-hoisting ceremony in Islamabad, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended. Similar ceremonies will also held in provincial, divisional and district headquarters. The country then resounded with sirens at 7:58am, heralding the grand flag-hoisting ceremony at 8am. The change of guard ceremonies were held at the mausoleums of Allama Iqbal in Lahore and Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi. In major cities, the authorities have chalked out various programs to celebrate Independence Day in a most befitting manner. As the country marks the day with a national holiday, various public and private sector departments are geared up to host a range of special functions and activities, including seminars, discussions, photographic exhibitions, artistic displays of paintings and poetry, national song renditions, and vibrant debate competitions to reflect on the monumental feat achieved 77 years ago. The spotlight today will be on recognising the tireless contributions of the leaders of the Pakistan Movement and the sacrifices made by national heroes and ordinary people as they fought for sovereignty and a right to self-determination in a time, even when the odds were against them. Streets and avenues of the federal capital and other cities have already turned into a sea of colours — especially green — and people adorn their houses, cars, and streets with flags, banners, and buntings, creating an ambience of festivity that is sorely needed. Prominent public and private edifices are aglow with illuminations, commemorating this significant occasion. Police across the country have finalised traffic management plans for the convenience and safety of the general public as people throng public spaces such as parks, malls, markets, and beaches to celebrate the day, mingling with each other. However, no one is as excited on this day as children, the country's biggest asset and its future. Cities across the country have turned green and white colour with Jashan-i-Azadi stalls carrying dresses, flags, buntings, pin badges, toys, and other decorative accessories to attract youngsters and children. Moreover, different brands, online retailers, eateries, cab-hailing services, and even electronics companies have offered exciting discounts, adding to the festivity. President Asif Ali Zardari, felicitated the nation on the 77th Independence Day, emphasised unity, integrity, and economic stability, urged following Quaid-e-Azam’s teachings, called for investment in youth and women, and reaffirmed support for Kashmiris and Palestinians. In his message on the occasion of the Independence Day, the president said that the creation of Pakistan through peaceful and democratic means was a unique chapter in history, with homage paid to the leaders, workers of the Pakistan movement, and forefathers, who made countless sacrifices for the nation. Zardari stressed the need to set aside differences and work with dedication for the unity, integrity, and economic stability of the country to cope with current challenges.  He noted that Pakistan was blessed with abundant human and natural resources, and it was the responsibility of all to utilize those for the welfare of the people. He also stressed the importance of upholding the rule of law, strengthening democratic institutions, and working in the public interest to meet the high expectations of the nation. The president urged drawing inspiration from Quaid-e-Azam’s leadership, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the well-being of the people, particularly the masses and the poor, to ensure Pakistan’s prosperity. He highlighted the need to invest in youth and women, enhance service delivery, and foster a business-friendly environment to build a stronger nation. “We need to draw inspiration from the words of our Quaid and if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, especially of the masses and the poor. It is time to invest in our youth and women, improve service delivery, and create a business-friendly environment to make Pakistan a great nation,” he added. The president called for remembering the struggles of the people of Indian Illegally occupied Kashmir and Palestinian people, who have been fighting for their freedom and right to self-determination for over seven decades. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the legitimate rights of those in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine.  Zardari also urged a collective commitment to uplift the nation and work towards making Pakistan a prosperous country, concluding with a prayer for Allah’s guidance and support. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowing to work collectively for an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan, said that the government’s efforts for economic growth and stability had started yielding positive results. “In a short span, our efforts have started yielding positive results. The economy is on its path to stability. The high inflation of 38% has come down to 11.1% (July) and shall be brought down to single digit soon Inshallah,” the prime minister said in his message to the nation on the Independence Day. Extending heartfelt felicitations to the countrymen, the prime minister paid homage to the immense sacrifices of forefathers and countless unsung heroes of the Pakistan Movement which led to the creation of Pakistan as an independent and sovereign state on August 14, 1947 through the unwavering and steadfast leadership of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and unmatched sacrifices of our ancestors. He said that over the decades, Pakistan had achieved significant milestones as the resilience of Pakistani people had been tested through natural disasters and economic and social challenges, yet the spirit of determination and unity has always prevailed. He expressed confidence that the nation would make collaborative efforts with the spirit of independence for the benefit and welfare of the citizens. Also acknowledging the key role of overseas Pakistanis in the progress and prosperity of Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz said that the country was proud of their hard work and achievements and considered them as true Ambassadors of Pakistan to project its positive image to the world. He also expressed gratitude to the Pakistan armed forces, who safeguarded the country’s borders and protected its sovereignty. “While we celebrate our freedom, we also remember the brave people of the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK) and Palestine who have been fighting for their right to self-determination for over seven decades and are facing the worst form of state atrocities,” he remarked and reiterated Pakistan’s continuous moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle their universal right to self-determination. The prime minister said that Pakistan would also continue its support for the oppressed Palestinians for their legitimate rights. “Pakistan stands at a crossroads today. While the common values, rich cultural heritage and diverse traditions continue to bind us together, our economy continues to face significant challenges in the shape of inflation, high-energy costs, unemployment and a growing debt burden.” He said that since assuming power after the February 2024 elections, the government’s consistent focus was on creating the right conditions for economic growth and stability. He said that Pakistan’s rich natural resources and a youthful workforce were true assets. He said the government was taking steps to attract investments to take full advantage of these resources to create job opportunities, speed the pace of industrialization, and bring economic prosperity. The government’s focus is also on education and skill development that will further empower our youth and equip them with the tools needed in the competitive global economy, he added. “I am personally supervising the national drive to digitize the entire ecosystem and broaden the tax base so that we can provide relief to those already paying taxes…The government is working hard to bring down the prices of electricity and the nation will see the results soon,” he remarked. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the behalf of all Americans, extended his heartfelt wishes to the people of Pakistan as they celebrate their Independence Day today. “For 77 years, the ties between our people have served as the foundation of our relationship. In the year ahead, we will deepen the US-Pakistan partnership and expand our people-to-people ties to build a more prosperous future for both our nations.” He said the US look forward to continuing a partnership that makes both countries more secure, as they strengthen their shared commitment to democratic principles and respect for the rule of law. “I wish all those celebrating today – in Pakistan, the United States, and across the world – a joyous Independence Day,” he added.

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Wednesday that he would soon share \"good news\" with the nation regarding a reduction in electricity prices and will also outline a new economic plan. Pakistanis have been receiving inflated bills for months now as the government keeps increasing prices to cut the power debt as well as implement conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"Today, there is inflation. People are worried about electricity bills and other problems. However, if not all is good in the country, not all is bad,\" the prime minister said during an event in Islamabad held to mark the 77th Independence Day. The premier said Pakistan's industries cannot prosper and exports cannot increase without a reduction in electricity bills, adding that he will address the nation in a few days and present a five-year economic plan. A day earlier, PM Shehbaz said the government was focused on providing low-cost electricity as it was \"inevitable\" to steer the country out of prevailing crisis.  “Our sole focus is to reduce power prices to provide relief to domestic consumers, agriculture, industry, exports and business sectors. This is inevitable to steer the economy of prevailing issues. The competitiveness of exports is linked with cheap electricity,” he said.  Moreover, The News had reported that the government was making plans for rationalising power tariffs through different proposals including slashing allocation of development budget at federal and provincial levels. It was revealed that the government is also working on closing down domestic independent power producers (IPPs) belonging to the government and private sectors. However, the IMF has not yet granted its endorsement for the power rationalisation plan, according to the sources. PM Shehbaz also called low-cost electricity and efficient power transmission system the major factors for a stable economy. The federal government also had last week struck an agreement with the Jamaat-e-Islami, in which it agreed to form a task force aimed at addressing issues related to IPPs, reducing electricity bills, and lowering taxes on the salaried class."

  "description": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Wednesday that there will be no spectators for the second Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh owing to construction at Karachi’s National Bank Stadium in preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. The second series is scheduled for August 30 to September 3, with the PCB saying in a statement that it was a “difficult decision” to hold the Test without an audience. “We understand the vital role that our passionate spectators play in cricket, providing inspiration and motivation to our players,” the board said. “However, the health and safety of our fans is our utmost priority. After careful consideration of all available options, we have decided that the safest course of action is to hold the second Test in front of an empty stadium.” Ticket sales have been suspended with immediate effect, the PCB said, adding that fans who have already purchased tickets will receive a full refund.         “While we deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause, we want to assure our valued fans that the ongoing stadium upgrades are aimed at enhancing their experience. It said that the renovations were part of the board’s commitment to making the venue more spectator-friendly and preparing it for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which will be the first ICC event hosted in Pakistan since 1996. The Bangladesh squad arrived in Lahore on Tuesday for the test series and were scheduled to train at Gaddafi Stadium from Aug 14 to 16 before travelling to Islamabad on Aug 17 to practice at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from Aug 18 to 20. The opening Test will be played from Aug 21 to 25 in Rawalpindi.

  "description": "Pakistan’s leaders, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, pledged to bring economic stability to Pakistan as the country celebrates 77 years of independence today (Wednesday). Speaking at a flag-hoisting ceremony in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz vowed to work hard to reduce inflation and electricity prices as well as revamp Pakistan’s economy, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. Stressing the need for self-introspection to correct mistakes of the past, he called for a “fresh journey with new zeal […] to steer the country out of existing crises”. The premier highlighted that “hard work, honesty and passion” were needed to set the country on the path of development and prosperity. Terming a decrease in inflation and electricity bills as vital to provide solace to domestic power consumers, PM Shehbaz said the nation would soon hear good news regarding power bills in the next few days and that a five-year economic programme will soon be launched.         Echoing the army chief’s remarks last night assailing “digital terrorism”, the prime minister said the “foes of Pakistan have continuously been targeting the minds of young people through digital terrorism to mislead them”. He called on the youth to “avoid becoming prey to the forces of chaos, anarchy and deception”. PM Shehbaz also paid tribute to people from all walks of life, including labourers, daily wagers, engineers, doctors, journalists and students, for their contributions to Pakistan. He further hailed security forces personnel and law enforcement agencies for rendering supreme sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “May we embrace unity, faith and discipline in our strive for peace, justice and welfare for all citizens as we work together to build a stronger nation,” the premier said on X.         “Our unwavering commitment to Pakistan’s progress and prosperity on Independence Day 2024: reforms and continuous struggle, we will beautify tomorrow’s Pakistan,” he had said in a late-night message on Tuesday.         In his message, President Zardari said the day marked the “culmination of historic political struggle of Muslims of India for their right to self-determination”. “We need to set aside our differences and work committedly for unity, integrity, and economic stability,” he was quoted as saying by Radio Pakistan.      The president called for upholding the rule of law and strengthening democratic institutions. He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the people of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK) and Palestine. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also highlighted the theme of ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (resolve for stability) this year. Nation marks Independence Day Earlier today, PM Shehbaz hoisted the national flag at the ceremony held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad, where Olympic gold medallist Arshad Nadeem, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani and other notable guests were also in attendance.            View this post on Instagram              The day dawned with a 31-gun salute at the capital and a 21-gun salute at the provincial headquarters, Radio Pakistan said.            View this post on Instagram              Special prayers were also offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country. A Change of Guards ceremony was held at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi in the morning, where a contingent of cadets of the Pakistan Naval Academy assumed the charge. “Celebrating the spirit of 77 years of Independence by honouring our nation’s resilience, diversity and unity on this Independence Day,” the government said in a post on its official X account. “Let’s continue to work together towards a prosperous and peaceful future for all,” it added, along with the hashtag “Azm-i-Istehkam” (resolve for stability).         Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz attended a flag-hoisting ceremony in Lahore, saying in a post on X that there was “no bigger honour than of raising Pakistan’s flag”.         Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah and Governor Kamran Tessori visited the Mazar-i-Quaid to commemorate the Independence Day. Speaking there, CM Murad hailed the people of Pakistan as “very resilient” and criticised those spreading negativity for “their own interests”. Murad’s counterpart in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, also participated in a similar event held at the Peshawar Secretariat. He was accompanied by provincial ministers, the KP police chief, the Peshawar chief secretary and other government officials.         Echoing other leaders’ messages, Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti highlighted the “strength that lies in our unity and resilience”. “Let’s honour the sacrifices that brought us this freedom and work for a more just and prosperous nation,” he said on X.         In a separate message on the occasion, PM Shehbaz paid homage to the “sacrifices of our forefathers and countless unsung heroes of the Pakistan Movement”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. He highlighted that the leaders “fought tirelessly for an independent country for millions in South Asia, where they could live according to their beliefs and values”. Remembering the people of IoK, the premier reiterated Pakistan’s pledge to continue extending moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiris until they achieve their universal right to self-determination. PM Shehbaz also vowed that Pakistan’s support for “oppressed Palestinians shall also continue for their legitimate rights”. Deputy PM stresses ‘progressive, modern state’ Deputy PM Dar said this year’s celebrations were centred around the theme ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’. “It is a reflection of our national commitment to grow and prosper as a progressive and modern state,” he said in a statement.         “Pakistanis have proven themselves as a strong and resilient nation. We stand firm against the forces of terror, extremism and division. We must unite and work together with a singular focus for a peaceful, tolerant and progressive society,” the deputy PM said. Dar extended his greeting to overseas Pakistanis who he said “have always stood for Pakistan’s progress and development”. “Wherever they are, their hearts beat for Pakistan.”      Speaking about IoK and Palestine, the foreign minister emphasised not to forget the people there who “remain under colonial occupation”. “Their sufferings remind us how blessed are we to enjoy the gift of freedom.” Reiterating support for the people of IoK, Dar said Pakistan would “continue to be a voice for the defenceless people facing oppression and foreign occupation”. “Our foreign policy will always be guided by the values and principles espoused by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.” Meanwhile, the armed forces, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Lieutenant General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs extended their heartfelt felicitations as well. “On this auspicious day, the armed forces of Pakistan pay tribute to the visionary founding fathers and valiant veterans, who rendered supreme sacrifices in their unwavering pursuit of freedom and self-determination,” Radio Pakistan quoted a statement as saying. “Their unrelenting spirit and sacrifices continue to inspire generations,” it added. The armed forces reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to defending Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and values, upholding the trust reposed in them by the nation”. “As we celebrate this Independence Day, we reiterate our resolve to preserve our hard-won freedom with honour, dignity and an unshakeable commitment to our cherished ideals,” the forces vowed.

  "description": "• In address at Kakul, Gen Munir says Constitution guarantees free speech, but within limits • Calls Azm-i-Istehkam ‘need of the hour’; tells Kabul not to ‘choose TTP over Pakistan’ • Says govt, military united against elements trying to destabilise Balochistan KARACHI: Army Chief Gen Asim Munir on Tuesday blamed foreign powers for a wave of ‘digital terrorism’, which he said aimed to create a gulf between state institutions and the people of Pakistan. Calling anti-terror activities under the umbrella of vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ the need of the hour, Gen Munir vowed that elements trying to create such rifts would only reap disappointment. In a wide-ranging speech at a parade held to mark Independence Day at the Pakistan Military Acad­emy in Kakul, he addressed key issues, such as the situation on the Western border with Afghanistan, the threat posed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the situation in Balochistan.     In recent statements, the military has taken a harsh line against criticism on social media, with Gen Munir himself warning that it was being used as a tool to spread anarchy and false information targeting the armed forces. The term ‘digital terrorism’ is increasingly being used by the military to describe the use of online spaces by its harshest critics — including PTI activists — whom it accuses of spreading falsehoods. A number of PTI figures, such as party spokesperson Raoof Hasan and other social media activists, have also been detained and face charges related to ‘digital terrorism’. On Tuesday, while quoting a verse from Surah Al Hujurat, Gen Munir stressed the importance of investigating and verifying information so as not to cause consternation among the people. He also said that while the Constitution allows for freedom of speech, it also contains clear limits to what constitutes free speech. “To the inimical forces, let it be clear; that regardless of the multilayered and multidimensional threats piled up against us we stand united and reassured. Traditional or non-traditional, dynamic or proactive, whatever form of warfare is applied against us, our retribution will be sharp and painful and we will certainly strike back. “For indeed, we know that freedom is not for free, it costs many great sons and daughters, and we are always ready for that. I have full faith and confidence that the people of Pakistan and its security forces will never relent and let anyone cast an evil eye on this great country,” he said. Kabul, TTP and Balochistan Maintaining that Pakis­tan desired good relations with its Western neighbor, Gen Munir called on the Afghan Taliban not to prefer the banned terror group TTP over its long-standing and brotherly neighbor to the east. The chief of army staff also assailed the TTP — which he referred to as Fitna al-Khawarij — for its “anti-state and anti-Sharia activities” in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saying that it had reared its head once again in the province. Paying tribute to the sacrifices and patriotism of the Pakhtuns, he declared that since these terrorist groups did not accept Sharia or the Constitution of Pakistan, the country also would not consider them Pakistani. Referring to the situation in Balochistan, which has witnessed a wave of protests organized by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in recent weeks, Gen Munir vowed that the army and the governments at the Centre and in the province were committed to ensuring the security and welfare of the Baloch people. Some elements, who are trying to destabilise the province, should know that they will not be allowed to weaken the country, he said. This was an apparent reference to the BYC protests. In a recent press conference, the military’s spokesperson denounced the BYC as a “proxy of terrorist organisations and criminal mafias”, saying that it was spreading propaganda against law enforcement agencies who were taking action against smugglers and criminals. International concerns While most of his speech was in Urdu, the army chief switched to English to thank friendly countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Turkiye for standing by Pakistan in trying times. He also called attention to the plight of the Kashmiris, whose efforts to free themselves from the yoke of Indian oppression could never be forgotten. “We stand rock solid with them for their indelible right to self determination… and reassure our full political, diplomatic support to the valiant people of Kashmir.” Calling attention to the reality of the horrendous genocide being perpetrated against the people of Gaza, he said it was a blemish on the world’s conscience that Pakistan would continue to oppose at every forum in the world.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Former information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani has launched efforts to unite opposition parties on the one-point agenda of securing Imran Khan’s release from prison. The move has come as a surprise to many as Mr Durrani is traditionally considered close to the establishment, having been a minister in the cabinet of former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. After remaining absent from the political scene for several years, he re-emerged ahead of the February 8 general elections. Talking to Dawn, Mr Durrani rejected the impression that he was gathering opposition parties at anyone’s behest and claimed that he wanted to play his role as a facilitator to save the country from crisis.  Durrani, who served in the cabinet under Pervez Musharraf, recently re-emerged on political scene after a prolonged absence  On Monday night, Mr Durrani hosted a dinner in Islamabad, which was attended by a number of key political figures from opposition parties.         Those in attendance included PTI leaders Asad Qaiser, Omar Ayub, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shibli Faraz and Barrister Saif; JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman; PkMAP Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai; Jamaat-i-Islami leader Liaqat Baloch; as well as Safdar Abbasi and Sajid Tareen, among others. According to a statement, leaders of the opposition parties agreed to work to get political prisoners released from jail and to further enhance their cooperation to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Mr Durrani claimed that this was an organic development, in line with the wishes of the people, rather than an ‘engineered’ move. He also said the controversy of Form 45 and Form 47 should be addressed. Talking to Dawn on the occasion, PTI leader Asad Qaisar said there is an understanding among opposition parties that their leaders should unite on the agenda of saving the country, the instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and the state of the economy. “We want Imran Khan to be released,” Mr Qaiser said. “We want the country to be run in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law. The present government does not enjoy the mandate of the people.” Asked about the impression that Mr Durrani is considered the establishment’s man, the former speaker said that Mr Durrani had taken the initiative to gather political parties and play a role in the reconciliation process. “We don’t look at people. We are looking at the policies of the people and their points of view. Anyone who says the country should be run in accordance with the Constitution, we will stand by him. We have to address the issues of the country, ensure justice and the rule of law in the country,” he said. Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar has said that a comprehensive roadmap is being prepared involving all stakeholders to resolve all issues of Balochistan through talks. Presiding over a meeting on law and order and development in Balochistan at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that security was a big issue of the province as anti-state elements are trying to destroy peace in the province and it is necessary to eliminate these elements. Speaking at the meeting, Mr Dar said that Balochistan is close to the heart of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and that measures will be taken to address the issues being faced by the people of province. He said the province must receive all its rights and acknowledged the current economic difficulties that the province and the country are experiencing.  Says it is necessary to eliminate anti-state elements trying to destroy peace in province  However, the deputy prime minister held out an assurance that the “future of the country is bright”. He said despite “temporary economic challenges”, persistent effort and firm resolve of the government would lead to sustainable development and growth of Pakistan. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti briefed the deputy prime minister on the ongoing development projects and the security situation in the province. He said that improving education and healthcare is the top priority of the provincial government. According to Mr Bugti, various reforms are being introduced to enhance good governance which is essential for building a strong relationship of trust between the state and its citizens. The chief minister said that a scholarship programme for students doing Ph.D in science has been launched and 200 top universities of the world have been selected for this purpose. Additionally, he said, special scholarship programmes are being introduced for minorities and the transgender community, as well as other marginalised groups. He said the issue of the province’s backwardness could be addressed through equitable development and pointed out that release of federal government’s funds for approved development projects was extremely limited. If this trend continues, the chief minister feared, it would be impossible to complete federal-funded development projects even in coming decades. Mr Bugti said that the federal government’s firm commitment and practical measures are crucial for the development of Balo­chistan to bring it on a par with the other three provinces. The deputy prime minister assured Mr Bugti that the federal government would provide all possible support for development of Balochistan. The meeting was attended by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, Member of the National Assembly Mir Ijaz Jakhrani, Chief Minister Bugti, provincial ministers and senior officials.

  "description": "LAHORE: Indian forces shot dead an unidentified man who allegedly strayed across the border on the eve of Independence Day. Sources said the incident occurred near the border village of Hadyara, on the outskirts of Lahore. India’s Border Security Force (BSF) claimed that the man was trying to infiltrate into India before he was shot and killed, and tried to turn over the body to Pakistani authorities. However, Pakistan Rangers have refused to receive the body before a thorough investigation into the incident to establish the man’s identity, as per the Standard Operating Procedures devised by the two sides for the international border. According to the SOPs, border forces of both sides are supposed to be on the lookout for locals who inadvertently cross the border, and are supposed to return such individuals to the opposite side after satisfying themselves that the crossing was made inadvertently. There have been several cases in the past where Pakistani authorities have returned Indian citizens who strayed across the international boundary, and vice versa. But in the present case, Indian forces seemed to show little restraint before gunning down the man who allegedly crossed over into their territory. Sources said that BSF claimed they had first tried to alert the man, and then opened fire when he ignored their warnings, killing him on the spot. Discussions between the BSF and Pakistan Rangers on the matter continued until late on Tuesday night, sources said. However, there was no official word from Pakistani authorities.

  "description": "• Says Pakistan in talks with China to use local coal in power plants • Premier set to announce comprehensive economic reform plan today • Proposals include lowering duties and taxes, cutting red tape, diversifying exports ISLAMABAD: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday expressed concern over Rs500 billion lost each year to electricity theft and stressed the need to reduce power prices to provide relief to both domestic consumers and industries. He said the government and all its departments are working to provide low-cost electricity to citizens and bring in reforms to achieve economic stability. Besides, the government is holding discussions with China about using locally sourced coal in the power plants that Beijing-backed companies operate in Pakistan, which are mainly run on more expensive imported coal, the premier said. Meanwhile, in what appears to be a major reform agenda, PM Shehbaz is set to announce a sweeping economic reform plan on Wednesday (today), which aims to reduce average tariffs on imports to over 14 per cent as part of a government strategy to drive export-led growth. During a meeting with the newly appointed chairmen and board members of power distribution companies (Discos), PM Shehbaz attributed much of the electricity theft to collusion with Discos’ employees and stressed that reducing theft should be a top priority. He warned that failure to meet this target would not be tolerated and announced plans to recognise top performers in reducing theft. The premier also pointed out that circular debt has surged to Rs2.3 trillion, a figure representing nearly one-third of the country’s total receipts of Rs9 trillion last year. “Can a country be run with such a heavy burden?” he asked. To address these issues, the prime minister ordered the immediate implementation of smart metering in some Discos and mentioned ongoing negotiations with China to run power plants using a mix of local and imported coal, which could save the country $1 billion annually. Reform agenda The premier’s economic age­nda follows recommendations from two high-powered task for­ces, which he formed to guide the country towards sustainable economic development. One of these task forces, led by former WTO ambassador Dr Manzoor Ahmed and former National Tariff Comm­ission chairwoman Robina Athar, focused on tariff rationalisation. The other, led by Prof Stefan Dercon of Oxford University, provided insights on economic policy. Both Dr Ahmed and Prof Dercon were recruited as consultants after PM Shehbaz was impressed by their articles proposing solutions to revive Pakistan’s economy. Prof Dercon-led committee has already submitted recommendations to the Prime Minister’s Office with three-year targets ranging from exports to economic growth. Tariff rationalisation Sources told Dawn that the tariff rationalisation committee has proposed reducing the average tariff on imports from the current 19.5pc to 14.23pc over the next three years. This reduction would apply to customs duty, additional customs duty and regulatory duty. The suggested changes are based on average tariffs in regional countries like India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The committee noted that lowering tariffs could increase import volumes by 5pc, potentially boosting government revenue. They also advocated for adopting budgetary proposals from the Tariff Policy Board, which had previously been rejected by the FBR over concerns about decreased duty collection. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also supported the idea of lower import duties as part of an import liberalisation strategy. While the committee recommended reducing sales and withholding taxes on imports, it did not provide specific suggestions in this regard. The committee also recommended lowering duties on several products as part of the green economy. The projected impact of these tariff adjustments could lead to a $750 million increase in exports during the first year of implementation, with overall exports expected to rise from $32bn to $35bn over three years. However, these projections are significantly conservative compared to those of Prof Dercon, who estimated that targeted sectoral policies, particularly in commodities and IT, could result in an additional $20bn in exports annually, raising their share of GDP to 15pc by the fiscal year 2027-28. Grey areas Prof Dercon’s task force provided a detailed analysis of the economy’s grey areas, identifying barriers to reform and presenting recommendations. He noted that the success of these reforms hinges on support from the business community, political leadership and the establishment. The task force recommended reducing bureaucratic red tape and creating a level playing field for businesses to stimulate both domestic and foreign investment. It also advised market-based reforms to ensure secure and affordable energy, which is crucial for export promotion. Key strategies for export growth include diversifying exports in sectors such as agriculture, IT, and non-traditional industries, as well as integrating into global value chains. The task force also proposed lowering import duties to prevent import substitution. It also recommended the establishment of a policy unit under the finance minister to evaluate all taxes, energy tariffs, customs duties and subsidies through economic principles. The task force stressed the importance of broadening the tax base by spreading taxes more evenly across businesses and households, including through digitalisation, to reduce the burden on individual taxpayers. It also advised the state to reduce its footprint by privatising or improving the management of state-owned enterprises. The committee’s ambitious targets include achieving 6pc or higher GDP growth by FY28. It also projected an additional $10bn in private investment annually, increasing the investment component of GDP to 15pc by FY28. According to the study, public finances are on track with the IMF programme, with the tax-to-GDP ratio expected to reach 13.5pc by FY27. These measures are anticipated to create an additional one million private-sector jobs by FY28. Later, in a cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed the need to reduce production costs to revive the industrial and agricultural sectors. He noted that government initiatives, particularly in the power sector, were starting to yield positive results. He highlighted the need for reforms within the FBR to enhance tax collection and support national development. He shared his vision for revitalising the FBR by cutting red tape, streamlining paperwork and fully digitising the process. He also urged all ministries to go paperless, stressing that success was unattainable innovation. The cabinet also approved an increase in the number of Privatis­ation Board members from eight to 11, with the prime minister stipulating that the three new posts be filled by women, in line with his directive to increase female representation on key boards. The premier also sought a comprehensive privatisation plan for state-owned enterprises, whose denationalisation has already been approved. The cabinet also regularised all contractual employees of the Federal Board of Education. The meeting endorsed the decisions of the Economic Coordination Committee held on Aug 2 and said all urea factories will get uninterrupted gas supply. Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Sources say terrorists targeted checkpoint between Tiarza and Ladha tehsils • Tribal elder killed, another wounded in IED attack in Bajaur • Two ‘militants involved in Panjgur DC killing’ shot dead SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Four Frontier Corps personnel were martyred and 27 others injured in an attack on their checkpoint in Upper South Waziristan district on Monday evening, sources told Dawn on Tuesday. The militants, armed with RPGs and other heavy weapons, attacked the Mami Khel checkpoint located between Tiarza and Ladha tehsils of Upper South Waziristan. The security personnel posted at the checkpoint retaliated to the attack, and after an intense exchange of gunfire, the attackers escaped under the cover of darkness, according to sources. The martyrs and the injured personnel were shifted to South Waziristan Scouts Hospital in Wana. The four martyrs have been identified as Havaldar Nisar Buda Khel, Lance Naik Rasheed Mangal, Lance Naik Irfan and Sepoy Usman Gujjar. After the attack, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search for the attackers. Another FC checkpoint in the Zermelan area of Toi Khullah Tehsil was also attacked late on Monday. The attackers opened fire, resulting in a gun battle with the soldiers posted at the checkpoint. However, no casualties were reported as the militants managed to escape. Tribal elder killed In Bajaur, a tribal elder was killed and another critically wounded in a remote-controlled bomb blast in the hilly area of Barang tehsil on Tuesday. Residents and police officials told Dawn that the incident occurred in the Sapary area of Asil Targoo before sunset when the two tribal elders Malik Yar Khan and Malik Rozi Khan were going to attend an event in a nearby area. Malik Yar died on the spot while Malik Rozi was injured. The district police spokesman said IED was planted on the roadside. Two ‘militants’ killed in Panjgur In Panjgur, security forces claimed to have gunned down two militants allegedly involved in the attack on the Panjgur deputy commissioner. In a statement on Tuesday, a spo­kesman for the Balochistan Police’s Counter Terrorism Department said Frontier Corps, Police and Levies had launched a joint operation last night after the killing of the deputy commissioner. The statement claimed that the two suspected militants were killed after a heavy exchange of fire with security forces.

  "description": "KHYBER: The Tor­kham border crossing bet­ween Pakistan and Afgha­nistan remained closed for a second day, as border sec­urity officials could not reach an agreement on Tu­­e­­­sday over the construct­ion of a controversial check post on the Afghan side. Sources at Torkham said that Afghan auth­o­ri­ties did not attend the scheduled meeting on Tu­e­sday afternoon while an­other meeting later in the evening was postpo­ned till Wednesday (today). It was, however, speculated that the border would remain closed on Wednesday as well, due to Independence Day celebrations. Sources said that tho­ugh Pakistani authorities had asked customs and immigration officials to report to their respective duties in anticipation of a possible reopening of the border later on Tuesday, but no progress was made until late evening. They said the Afghan delegation failed to show up for a flag meeting scheduled for 3pm, with Pakistani authorities seeking another meeting in the evening. But that meeting, too, could not take place due to unspecified reasons, sources said. Customs and immigration officials posted at Torkham confirmed to Dawn they were instructed to remain on duty on Tuesday, but the border could not be reopened and thus no clearance of goods could take place. Both trade activities and pedestrian movement remained suspended on Tuesday, they said, adding that the two sides could not reach an agreement about the modalities of border reopening. A number of Afghan families, some travelling from Islamabad and different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reached Landi Kotal during the day after some unconfirmed posts appeared on social media about the reopening of border. However, they were disappointed to learn that the border was not opened till evening and had to move to Peshawar. The situation remained peaceful during the day with border forces on both sides remaining alert but no exchange of fire occurred throughout the day. On the other hand, Bacha Maina residents, who had shifted to safer places after the Monday crossfire, also stayed back and did not return to their homes for fear of any reoccurrence of the cross-border firing. Kabul claims civilian casualties Also on Tuesday, Afghan authorities claimed that three civilians were killed in Monday’s clashes between the two sides. Although Kabul accused Pakistan of being responsible for the deaths, a Pakistani official told AFP that three Pakistani soldiers were wounded in the exchange. “Despite repeated warnings and objections from the Pakistani side, Afghan officials did not halt the construction, leading to escalating tensions,” the officer said. There was no official word on the Afghan claim of three civilian casualties. Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2024 "

  "description": "LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) judge on Tuesday refused to hear prosecution’s plea seeking permission for a forensic audit of evidence against PTI founder Imran Khan in May 9 cases. The public prosecutor and investigating officers appeared before the duty ju­­dge, Irfan Haider, and sought permiss­ion to audit the evidence collected in 12 cases. The investigation officers said they needed to do a forensic analysis of the footage and mobile phones allegedly belonging to the PTI founding chairman. They also sought permission for the photogrammetric and voice match tests to be conducted on the former prime minister. They pleaded that tests and analysis could not be conducted when Mr Khan was in physical custody as the Lahore High Court (LHC) had quashed the remand. The judge noted that he could not hear or decide on the applications as he was a duty judge, and the prosecution should wait for the administrative judge who was on leave.  Asks prosecution to take matter to SC as LHC quashed ex-PM’s remand  He advised the investigation officers to approach the Supreme Court since the LHC had declared the PTI founder’s physical remand “null and void”. “My advice is to take the matter to the Supreme Court or wait [till] the end of the ATC administrative judge’s vacation,” Judge Haider said while addressing the prosecution. He also noted that after the LHC’s decision, the matter was no longer within the jurisdiction of anti-terrorism courts. Subsequently, the investigation officers withdrew the applications to file them again before the administrative judge in September. Last month, the police had secured physical remand of Mr Khan in 12 cases of May 9 riots, including an attack on the Lahore corps commander’s residence. However, a two-judge bench of the LHC overturned the decision and quashed the remand. Mr Khan’s bail applications in these cases are also pending before an ATC judge.

  "description": "On the 77th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence, herewith a brief exploration of the direct symbiotic relationship between national identity and national security. The stronger and firmer the reality of a national identity, the stronger and more stable is the condition of national security. Or is that so? The more the certainty in such sweeping statements as those made in the preceding paragraph, the greater the need to question such certainties — in order to reflect upon their implications. As also to explore what is left unsaid or is deliberately excluded from the statement of such convictions. So that if, eventually, one is to return to the certainties outlined at the outset, there is the assurance that these have been adopted only after some consideration. Identity yes; security no?! After all, in the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th century, the long-held, exclusive, well-formed Chinese national identity could not prevent British colonial interests and then Japanese forces from taking control of mainland China to hold its people in bondage. It then took the Communist Party’s Long March and other factors to expel alien domination. In almost equally long-established Egypt, the people’s sense of distinct national identity did not deter foreign invasions and occupation by European or Ottoman powers. Is national identity then only one of multiple elements that build national security? Four factors Let us begin with how words are used and how they are understood. Even before we attempt to examine the term ‘national identity’, let us visit the core word of ‘nation’. Nations of one kind or another have always existed in history, without necessarily being described as nations. In the modern context, the coupling of “nation” and “state”, and sometimes inadvertently misusing one term for another, has come to be widely used to define the formally organised units through which large groupings of people established their autonomy and presently conduct relations with other units.      The concept of ‘nation’ has evolved and crystallised quite rapidly in the first half of the 20th century. Perhaps four factors shaped the emergence of this concept and common use of the word ‘nation’. First: The cumulative impact of the Treaty of Westphalia in the 17th century. That pact initiated growing respect for the sanctity of territorial frontiers and, at least in a theoretical and formal sense, the principle of non-interference in the affairs of another state. This process encouraged a sense of solidarity among people living within demarcated frontiers which brought together groups and communities that began to see themselves as a nation instead of only being parts of clans, tribes and kingdoms. The focus also shifted by such entities gradually becoming people-centric rather than being exclusively ruler-centric. Second: the cataclysms and catastrophes of the two World Wars in the first half of the 20th century in which the emotions, interests and aspirations of nations were incited and inflamed — and held to be valid justifications for mass slaughter and destruction. Third: the end of colonial empires including the Ottoman and British empires in particular but also the end of colonial occupation of Africa, Latin America and Asia by the French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian and German states of Europe. All popular movements against colonial occupation effectively used slogans appealing to national affinities. Fourth: the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 with the signing of the UN Charter by 51 member-states. Over the past decades that number has almost quadrupled to its present level of 193 member states. The sheer proliferation of members of the UN has deepened and broadened the concept of “nation”. Incidentally, if the USA did not already exist in 1945, the more appropriate name of the new global body should have been “United States”! Two parts of national identity Regardless of the enormous variety of groupings and communities that are formally recognised as nations and nation states as well as sub-nations within a single state, it is necessary to note that national identity in all cases is always in two parts. One part is that of inherited identity whichever particular factor of inheritance it may be, eg language, ethnicity, faith, etc. The other part of national identity is always contemporary, evolving and in a state of flux because people’s lifestyles and characteristics are inevitably affected by the exact places where they reside, by the impact of international, regional, national and local conditions that influence their livelihoods and their cultures. Thus, a sizable part of national identity changes subtly and incrementally over time: it is not fixed or static Pakistan’s national identity In Pakistan’s case, there are two alternative views of national identity. One has deep roots in history. In his book Historical Foundations of Pakistan and its People by the (late) scholar Ahmed Abdulla, published in 1983, an analysis of the sovereignties exercised over the territory that now represents the land of Pakistan (post-December 1971) found that this part of the world was mostly autonomous and self-contained or subject to frequent intrusions from the north-west (Central Asia) or from the west (Persian or Arab). Over thousands of years, direct control from centres like Delhi, Agra or elsewhere lasted for only 700 years. For over 6,300 years the ancestors of about 90 per cent of the people of today’s Pakistan (the remaining approximately 10pc being those whose grandparents/parents migrated from other parts of South Asia and India in 1947 and later) resided and thrived, conflicted, or co-existed in peace with each other on the territory of contemporary Pakistan for most of recorded history. Despite being divided into tribes, fiefdoms or kingdoms, they had a direct relationship with the land that is now Pakistan.      Therefore, the creation of a nation state in August 1947 can be seen as the unavoidable, pre-destined fulfilment of a long, historical process reaching a new formative phase. Seen from this perspective, the growth of Muslim nationalism in South Asia after the abolition of the Mughal dynasty in 1857 became an inescapable, logical manifestation of a natural, continuous evolutionary saga. The other view of the national identity of Pakistanis is more limited and far more recent with a more sceptical interpretation. In this reading, Pakistan is seen as an “overnight nation” while simultaneously also becoming an “overnight state”. Because before August 1947 no nation had existed by the name of “the Pakistani nation”. Indeed, before January 1933 when Choudhry Rahmat Ali published his pamphlet ‘Now or Never’, even the very word “Pakistan” which he invented — leave alone a whole nation — did not exist. Such scepticism is also used to move to an even more cynical view: that the creation of Pakistan was a freak, abnormal deviation imposed by the British. And that, therefore, the alleged fabrication of a nation called Pakistan in which religion bound people together was so fragile that East Pakistan broke away in December 1971 and thereby demolished the claim of there being a genuine and sound basis for Pakistani nationalism and for Pakistani national identity. Authenticity of Muslim nationalism But fortunately, harsh reality crushes such cynicism, and even scepticism. The authenticity of a separate, distinct Muslim nationalism has been eloquently authenticated by the fact that, subsequent to December 1971, the people of Bangladesh fervently want to maintain their distinct Muslim Bangladeshi independent national identity. They do not want to be merged with Indian Hindu West Bengal on the basis of shared history, ethnicity or language — to prove that religion is one of the most potent factors in shaping national identity and aspirations. In December 1971, a combination of elements, including insensitivity by West Pakistani elites to East Pakistani rights and expectations, blunderous political and military decisions within Pakistan and a covert Indian conspiracy followed by overt Indian military intervention led to the disintegration of the original Pakistan. That turning point represented a rejection of the state structure of Pakistan — but it did not represent the rejection of Muslim nationalism. So distinct is Muslim national identity in South Asia that even though Muslims in India reside in different parts of the Indian state, speak different languages and have different lifestyles, they nevertheless share pride and exclusivity in their Muslim identity while remaining loyal citizens of the Indian state. The ugly spread of Hindutva in recent years expressed in the persecution of Muslims in general and in India-occupied Kashmir in particular has only strengthened Muslim identity as being separate from Hindu identity. Muslims in India are unavoidably or willingly, as the case may be, able to continue living in a single Indian state. Resilience of Pakistani identity The loss of East Pakistan was a devastating psychological and physical blow to the emerging national identity of Pakistan that had begun to grow over the 24-year period from 1947 to 1971. Yet it is a remarkable phenomenon of history as to how rapidly and resolutely the desire and passion of the people in (West) Pakistan expressed itself to ensure the continuity of the name of the State of Pakistan. One reflection of this instinctive urge to retain and to further build the broad, unifying national identity of being Pakistani is the fact that, in the past 52 years, through 11 general elections at the national and provincial levels, not a single political party based on ethnic or sub-nationalist elements alone has come to power at the federal or even, most of the time, at provincial levels. Parties such as the Awami National Party (ANP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party in Balochistan or the Balochistan National Party or the MQM in Sindh have almost always had to rule only as part of larger coalition alliances. Or, as in the case of ANP in KP in 2008-13, voters permitted that category of parties only one electoral term.      Post-1971, the country’s political landscape is dominated by political parties with a national, federal, unifying vision rather than by parties that espouse narrow versions of nationalism or religious sectarianism or extremism. This voting preference of the people of Pakistan, illiterate or literate, from one corner of the country or another testifies to the basic humanism and unifying dimension of Pakistani national identity. If all the meanings of a “nation” remain elusive, the word “identity” is comparatively straightforward. Identity comprises those physical and/or tangible characteristics that, in this context, determine the specificity of large numbers of people who see themselves as being part of a single nation-state even if some of them, at the same time, equally believe that they are also part of sub-nations or even full nations older in time than the nation to which they presently belong. When we come to consider the relationship of national identity with national security, the first clarification required is to note that the term “state security” is a more accurate and appropriate term than “national security” — even though the two terms can be said to be interchangeable and synonymous. Yet it is necessary to retain the specificity of state security as being relevant to the context of this essay, rather than the term “national security”. Security and insecurity To consciously exaggerate, but only to make the point: it is only historical nation states that have existed for hundreds or thousands of years that can be assumed to possess national security in the meaning of continuity, stability and even permanence as national entities, regardless of the precise form of the state structure within which these historical nations exist.      Virtually all other nations are relatively speaking in comparison to historical nations, still evolving and growing. Therefore, except for historical nation states, and perhaps also those founded by religious factors, all the others are, to a larger or lesser degree, insecure! In 2024, predominantly white Christian Italians, Hungarians, Germans, French, British feel threatened by the immigration of a few thousand non-white, non-Christians from Africa and Asia who seek refuge from violent conflicts and poverty. In this sense, after allowing for the distortive, misguiding role of populist elements in Europe, and in the USA, national identity also seems to have a strangely fragile facet that is easily vulnerable to exploitation by threats magnified out of all proportion to their actual scale.  One element of national security is unchangeable ie its location — if it is landlocked without access to the sea or a navigable river, that state is virtually at the mercy of one or more immediate neighbours.  16 elements of national security: There are possibly 16 elements of nation-state security: a) The capacity of a country’s armed forces to ensure the sanctity of borders and territory. b) The capacity of supporting civil armed institutions, eg the police, paramilitaries, etc to enforce a minimum degree of internal law and order. c) A national will in the people of a country to maintain the stability of the state and its permanence. d) Adequate resources to sustain prolonged armed conflict with an external adversary, or against internal threats. e) Possession of an ultimate deterrent usable against one or more external adversaries if the state’s very survival is threatened. f) The strength of the resolve by society and state to confront internal violent extremism or terrorism. g) Capacity to use effective counterterrorism agencies, most especially intelligence-gathering and the ability to conduct decisive pre-emptive operations. h) Support from friendly overseas countries, in cash and in kind eg oil supply on credit. i) Support from overseas countries through diplomacy at the UN and in other international forums. j) Capacity to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and ensure water and food security for the people. k) A productive economy that harnesses the human and natural resources of a country through advanced human development and good governance, without heavy dependence on foreign aid and loans. l) Balanced population growth and particularly the health, education and work-status of girls and women. m) Quality of relations with immediate neighbouring states. n) Nature of location of the state’s territory and its size, eg access to seas, or being landlocked. o) Maturity of the political structures of the state to ensure accurate representation and articulation of the views of all, or most parts of the nation, including freedom of worship and representation for religious minorities. p) Cyber power capacity, particularly for timely detection of attempted hacking of sensitive security cyber networks and systems, and to retaliate with cyber power capacity if threatening intrusions recur. Similarly, capacity to survive in hybrid warfare, if unleashed upon the country by hostile forces. There is a direct linkage between some elements of national identity and some elements of national security. For instance: those dimensions that personify the determination to survive formidable odds and setbacks as those faced in 1947 and 1971 are linked to the strength of a nation’s will to ensure the permanence of the state, despite external and internal dangers.    Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman speaks during the historic Muslim League session at Lahore, 1940.  One element of national security is unchangeable ie its location — if it is landlocked without access to the sea or a navigable river, that state is virtually at the mercy of one or more immediate neighbours which do have access. Another element of national security is not entirely within the control of a country eg the volume of its external trade that shapes its economy is determined by international flows of commerce and tariffs. Yet another element of national security, particularly for a country like Pakistan whose carbon emissions are less than one per cent of global emissions, is nevertheless rated to be one of the 10 out of about 200 countries that are becoming the worst victims of climate change.      In the quality of relations with immediate neighbouring states, in the case of Pakistan, the state of relations with India is predominantly affected by India’s hegemonic posture and its historic animosity against Pakistan. At the simultaneous birth of Pakistan and India in August 1947, more than one Indian leader (falsely) predicted that Pakistan would not last more than six months. Despite the partial fulfilment of this malignant attitude 24 years later with the formation of Bangladesh, Pakistan has survived for 52 years. This reality does not sit well with the extremist Hindutva forces that currently dominate Indian political power. As if this were not bad enough, another immediate neighbour, Afghanistan, has refused to fully accept the permanence of the Durand Line demarcated in 1897 and enforced in 1947 as the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Support by Afghanistan to the TTP, as of 2024, is a reflection of this basic hindrance. While there have been some limited positive phases in relations with these two immediate neighbours, by itself Pakistan is unable to concretise this particular element of national security because the onus for truly accepting the permanence and reality of Pakistan lies with India and Afghanistan. The 16 elements of national security can be divided into three clusters ie one over which the Pakistani nation state has no direct control whatsoever eg global-scale climate change, global economic trends. A second cluster of elements consists of those over which there can only be partial control by Pakistan eg relations with immediate neighbours, level of response from international community, etc. A third cluster of elements comprises those in which Pakistan can exert virtually complete control eg balanced population growth, effectiveness of pre-emptive operations against internal threats from violent extremism. In 2024, while cohesion between the political and military parts of the state is unhealthily dominated by the military, a more vigorous and sustained effort is required to also transcend the divisive schisms that come with partisan-based democracy — to apply a concerted, holistic, unified approach to bind national identity with national security.

  "description": "LAHORE: The 13th Punjab cabinet, presided over by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday, approved various public welfare projects, including Roshan Gharana Programme, under which solar  home solution will be provided to protected consumers using up to 100 electricity units across Punjab. The cabinet also approved model house for “Apni Chhat, Apna  Ghar” project, under which Rs1.5m will be given to the beneficiaries for the construction of a  five-marla house in urban and 10-marla house in rural areas. A project to run electric buses in Lahore was also approved, under which 27 buses will reach Pakistan by December, 2024. The cabinet also gave nod to establish Punjab Grid  Company for direct supply of electricity to industries.  It considered provision of affordable electricity to Industrial Park  through direct transmission line from Bhiki, Balloki and Quaid-i-Azam  Solar Park. Amendment to Registration Act 1908 for Revenue Services to Overseas Pakistanis in eight countries was also approved by the cabinet, that will allow provision of revenue  services to Pakistanis residing in China, Saudi Arabia, United  Arab Emirates, UK, USA, Italy, Qatar, Bahrain and Spain. The cabinet  also gave approval to the Punjab government’s advertisement policy, approving feasibility study of the glass train to be run for tourists between Rawalpindi and Murree. The train is said to be a first of its kind project  in the country. Meanwhile, the cabinet meeting was also attended by “tainted” Minister for Mines and Minerals Sardar Sher Ali Gorchani, against whom the chief minister had announced issuing a show-cause notice on corruption allegations a few days ago. Sources privy to the meeting say that Mr Gorchani was given a routine protocol and was rather seated close to the chief minister. A video of Mr Gorchani had gone viral last week in which he was apparently assuring a contractor by phone that he would manage to manipulate the bidding process to secure the contract of a project (plots auction) for him. CM Maryam, taking ‘swift’ notice of the video, had announced forming a five-member committee led by Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman to thoroughly investigate the matter and submit a report to her. She had also ordered issuance of a show-cause notice to Gorchani to explain his position with regard to the corruption allegation within three days, reiterating her governments “firm stance” against corruption. However, neither any probe committee was formed, nor a show-cause issued to the minister from Rajanpur who had served as deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly from 2013 to 2018 in Shehbaz Sharif government.

  "description": "The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to meet on Thursday to devise a strategy to tackle a rapid global increase in cases of mpox, formerly called monkeypox, and some cases of the Zika virus, according to an official. Africa’s top public health body declared what it termed a “public health emergency of continental security” on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries. World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has promised to convene an emergency committee to discuss whether the outbreak in Congo represents a public health emergency of international concern. The viral infection is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill. NCOC Deputy Coordinator Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan told Dawn.com today that Thursday’s meeting will be chaired by NCOC Director General Dr Shabana Saleem and virtually attended by provincial DGs. He said it will discuss the availability of testing kits, arrangements at entry points of the country and availability of isolation wards and beds in hospitals nationwide. “Border Security Services has been also invited to attend the meeting so that a foolproof arrangement would be made to stop the arrival of the virus in the country or case of an arrival of an infected patient, he/she would be isolated without any delay. Although WHO has not issued any advisory over it, we are expecting to get it any time,” Khan said. He said Pakistan received mpox cases from Arab countries in the past and there were chances that the people travelling from the Middle East may again carry the virus. Dr Khan, an infectious disease specialist, said mpox was being reported in African countries but as the world was a global village, the virus could reach any country at any time. “A control room has already been set up at the NCOC to tackle possible mpox spread in the country,” he added. Replying to a question, he said that a testing kit was used to collect fluid from the wounds of the patient and a polymerase chain reaction test was conducted to confirm the presence of the virus. Mpox was declared a global health emergency by the WHO  in July 2022. In November same year, the organisation renamed the disease from the older term of monkeypox, citing concerns of stigma and racism associated with the name. Dr Khan also said that the Zika virus was an emerging mosquito-borne virus that was first identified in Uganda. “Adults do not suffer much because of the Zika virus but brain development stops in babies if a mosquito bites pregnant women,” he said.

  "description": "The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to meet as the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries. Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. Determining a disease outbreak as a “public health emergency of international concern” or PHEIC — the WHO’s highest level of alert — can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and cooperation to contain the disease. The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering action from the WHO. “It’s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Africa’s top public health body declared a mpox emergency for the continent a day ago after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate. More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160 per cent increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases. A different form of the mpox virus — clade IIb — spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later. In November of the same year, the organisation renamed the disease from the older term of monkeypox, citing concerns of stigma and racism associated with the name. Meanwhile, NCOC Deputy Coordinator Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan told Dawn.com today that Thursday’s meeting will be chaired by NCOC Director General Dr Shabana Saleem and virtually attended by provincial DGs to devise a strategy to tackle the rapid global increase in cases of mpox and some cases of the Zika virus.

  "content": "    RAWALPINDI: Adiala Jail's deputy superintendent Muhammad Akram has been taken into custody on charges of aiding incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, sources told Geo News on Wednesday. Akram was removed from his post on June 20, while Deputy Superintendent Judicial Tahir Siddique Shah replaced him as security supervisor of PTI founder Imran Khan.  The Punjab home department (prison section), through a notification, had removed Muhammad Akram, directing him to leave the charge and report to the Prisons Department, Lahore.   The law enforcement agencies started interrogating the arrested senior officer of Central Jail Rawalpindi — also known as Adiala Jail. The sources said Akram would allegedly convey the jailed PTI founder messages outside the prison facility secretly. They said that the LEAs formally informed the Inspector General of Prisons, Punjab, regarding the senior police officer arrest and probe. After the completion of the probe, the suspect would face departmental action. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than one year after he was booked in plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case.  His wife, Bushra Bibi, has also been behind bars for months. However, a court suspended his sentence in the Toshakhana case, while other courts overturned his convictions in the cipher and iddat cases, respectively. While there were hopes for his and Bushra's release in July, they were dashed when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested them on fresh charges related to the sale of state gifts. The chances of Imran's release from jail further dimmed after the Lahore Police declared his arrest in several cases related to the May 9, 2023, riots, that erupted after his detainment from from Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises last year in which protesters targeted government and military installations."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Adiala Jail's former deputy superintendent Muhammad Akram has been taken into custody on charges of facilitating incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, sources told Geo News on Wednesday. Akram was removed from his post on June 20, while Deputy Superintendent Judicial Tahir Siddique Shah replaced him as security supervisor of PTI founder Imran Khan. The Punjab home department (prison section), through a notification, had removed Muhammad Akram, directing him to leave the charge and report to the Prisons Department, Lahore.   The law enforcement agencies started interrogating the arrested senior officer of Central Jail Rawalpindi — also known as Adiala Jail. The sources said Akram would allegedly convey the jailed PTI founder messages outside the prison facility secretly. They said that the LEAs formally informed the Inspector General of Prisons, Punjab, regarding the senior police officer arrest and probe. After the completion of the probe, the suspect would face departmental action. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than one year after he was booked in plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case.  His wife, Bushra Bibi, has also been behind bars for months. However, a court suspended his sentence in the Toshakhana case, while other courts overturned his convictions in the cipher and iddat cases, respectively. While there were hopes for his and Bushra's release in July, they were dashed when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested them on fresh charges related to the sale of state gifts. The chances of Imran's release from jail further dimmed after the Lahore Police declared his arrest in several cases related to the May 9, 2023, riots, that erupted after his detainment from from Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises last year in which protesters targeted government and military installations."

  "content": "As monsoon rains continue to lash various parts of the country, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a flash flooding alert for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from today till August 18. The National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the NDMA has said that moderate to heavy rains are expected in Hazara, Malakand Division, Peshawar, Bannu, DI Khan, Hangu, Haripur, Kohat, Kurram, Lucky Marwat, Mohmand, Orakzai and Waziristan areas. It is to be noted that the monsoon rains, since July, have resulted in as many as 178 fatalities, including 92 children, across the country since July with the collapse of homes being the biggest cause of death. The downpour, as per the NDMA, might cause urban flooding in various cities and flash flooding in hilly areas with an expected increase in the flow of water in the streams and nullahs. Calling on the authorities and the masses to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and landslides, the government body has directed all relevant departments to alert emergency response teams and mobilised resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. Furthermore, tourists have been advised to avoid travelling to these areas during this time period. A day earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had also alerted district administrations in the province in light of expected rains saying that the showers might cause landslides as well as flooding in the rivers."

  "content": "Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has approved the designs of Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi stadiums set to host Champions Trophy 2025 in February-March next year. The approval comes after Naqvi BDP Pattern's London head office, a renowned architectural company based in the United Kingdom, where he met Chairman Chris Harding and other senior officials. A day earlier, sources told Geo News that the board commenced renovation work at National Stadium which will be one of the three venues that will host the next year's mega tournament. The other two arenas picked by the PCB to host the Champions Trophy are Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium and Rawalpindi International Cricket Stadium. The PCB has allocated Rs12.80 billion for the upgradation of the three venues which will be renovated ahead of the marquee event which has been proposed to be held from February 19 to March 9 next year. Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has approved a budget of around $70 million for the tournament with the amount set to cover the expenses incurred during the support period which has been scheduled from February 12 to 18. The support period window has been designated for warm-up matches, media activities, and promotional events. All activities during the support period will be determined in consultation between the ICC and PCB. The ICC will decide on the warm-up matches in consultation with all teams. Upon approval, each team will be able to play a maximum of two warm-up matches, which will also be held in three cities — Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi. During his visit to the BDP's office, PCB Chairman Naqvi was given a detailed briefing about the stadiums' upgradation project. Expressing satisfaction with the venues' designs, the board's head said that it was the first time that the arenas were being upgraded to cater for such a large number of cricket fans. Highlighting that he was personally supervising this mega project, Naqvi reaffirmed the commitment to complete the challenging task of the stadium's renovation before the Champions Trophy. It is to be noted that the UK-based architectural company, founded 63 years ago, has designed around 200 stadiums on international standards in various countries leading it to secure more than 1,000 design quality awards."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: As the country suffers with high inflation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said he would soon share \"good news\" regarding a reduction in exorbitant power bills.  \"Today, there is inflation. People are worried about electricity bills and other problems. However, if not all is good in the country, not all is bad,\" PM Shehbaz said while addressing an Independence Day event in Islamabad.  The premier said Pakistan's industries cannot prosper and exports cannot increase without a reduction in electricity bills, adding that he will address the nation in a few days and present a five-year economic plan. His comments come amid outcry by the nation due to inflated bills as the government keeps increasing prices to cut the power debt as well as implement conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A day earlier, PM Shehbaz said the government was focused on providing low-cost electricity as it was \"inevitable\" to steer the country out of prevailing crisis.  “Our sole focus is to reduce power prices to provide relief to domestic consumers, agriculture, industry, exports and business sectors. This is inevitable to steer the economy of prevailing issues. The competitiveness of exports is linked with cheap electricity,” he said.  Moreover, The News had reported that the government was making plans for rationalising power tariffs through different proposals including slashing allocation of development budget at federal and provincial levels. It was revealed that the government is also working on closing down domestic independent power producers (IPPs) belonging to the government and private sectors. However, the IMF has not yet granted its endorsement for the power rationalisation plan, according to the sources. PM Shehbaz also called low-cost electricity and efficient power transmission system the major factors for a stable economy. The federal government also had last week struck an agreement with the Jamaat-e-Islami, in which it agreed to form a task force aimed at addressing issues related to IPPs, reducing electricity bills, and lowering taxes on the salaried class."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The nation is celebrating its 77th Independence Day with traditional zeal and fervour on Wednesday, with commemorative ceremonies being held across the country. The day dawned with a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute in the provincial headquarters. Special prayers were offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country. The main event of the celebrations was a national flag-hoisting ceremony in Islamabad, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended. Similar ceremonies will also held in provincial, divisional and district headquarters. The country then resounded with sirens at 7:58am, heralding the grand flag-hoisting ceremony at 8am. The change of guard ceremonies were held at the mausoleums of Allama Iqbal in Lahore and Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi. In major cities, the authorities have chalked out various programs to celebrate Independence Day in a most befitting manner. As the country marks the day with a national holiday, various public and private sector departments are geared up to host a range of special functions and activities, including seminars, discussions, photographic exhibitions, artistic displays of paintings and poetry, national song renditions, and vibrant debate competitions to reflect on the monumental feat achieved 77 years ago. The spotlight today will be on recognising the tireless contributions of the leaders of the Pakistan Movement and the sacrifices made by national heroes and ordinary people as they fought for sovereignty and a right to self-determination in a time, even when the odds were against them. Streets and avenues of the federal capital and other cities have already turned into a sea of colours — especially green — and people adorn their houses, cars, and streets with flags, banners, and buntings, creating an ambience of festivity that is sorely needed. Prominent public and private edifices are aglow with illuminations, commemorating this significant occasion. Police across the country have finalised traffic management plans for the convenience and safety of the general public as people throng public spaces such as parks, malls, markets, and beaches to celebrate the day, mingling with each other. However, no one is as excited on this day as children, the country's biggest asset and its future. Cities across the country have turned green and white colour with Jashan-i-Azadi stalls carrying dresses, flags, buntings, pin badges, toys, and other decorative accessories to attract youngsters and children. Moreover, different brands, online retailers, eateries, cab-hailing services, and even electronics companies have offered exciting discounts, adding to the festivity. President Asif Ali Zardari, felicitated the nation on the 77th Independence Day, emphasised unity, integrity, and economic stability, urged following Quaid-e-Azam’s teachings, called for investment in youth and women, and reaffirmed support for Kashmiris and Palestinians. In his message on the occasion of the Independence Day, the president said that the creation of Pakistan through peaceful and democratic means was a unique chapter in history, with homage paid to the leaders, workers of the Pakistan movement, and forefathers, who made countless sacrifices for the nation. Zardari stressed the need to set aside differences and work with dedication for the unity, integrity, and economic stability of the country to cope with current challenges. He noted that Pakistan was blessed with abundant human and natural resources, and it was the responsibility of all to utilize those for the welfare of the people. He also stressed the importance of upholding the rule of law, strengthening democratic institutions, and working in the public interest to meet the high expectations of the nation. The president urged drawing inspiration from Quaid-e-Azam’s leadership, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the well-being of the people, particularly the masses and the poor, to ensure Pakistan’s prosperity. He highlighted the need to invest in youth and women, enhance service delivery, and foster a business-friendly environment to build a stronger nation. “We need to draw inspiration from the words of our Quaid and if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, especially of the masses and the poor. It is time to invest in our youth and women, improve service delivery, and create a business-friendly environment to make Pakistan a great nation,” he added. The president called for remembering the struggles of the people of Indian Illegally occupied Kashmir and Palestinian people, who have been fighting for their freedom and right to self-determination for over seven decades. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the legitimate rights of those in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine. Zardari also urged a collective commitment to uplift the nation and work towards making Pakistan a prosperous country, concluding with a prayer for Allah’s guidance and support.  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowing to work collectively for an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan, said that the government’s efforts for economic growth and stability had started yielding positive results. “In a short span, our efforts have started yielding positive results. The economy is on its path to stability. The high inflation of 38% has come down to 11.1% (July) and shall be brought down to single digit soon Inshallah,” the prime minister said in his message to the nation on the Independence Day. Extending heartfelt felicitations to the countrymen, the prime minister paid homage to the immense sacrifices of forefathers and countless unsung heroes of the Pakistan Movement which led to the creation of Pakistan as an independent and sovereign state on August 14, 1947 through the unwavering and steadfast leadership of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and unmatched sacrifices of our ancestors. He said that over the decades, Pakistan had achieved significant milestones as the resilience of Pakistani people had been tested through natural disasters and economic and social challenges, yet the spirit of determination and unity has always prevailed. He expressed confidence that the nation would make collaborative efforts with the spirit of independence for the benefit and welfare of the citizens. Also acknowledging the key role of overseas Pakistanis in the progress and prosperity of Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz said that the country was proud of their hard work and achievements and considered them as true Ambassadors of Pakistan to project its positive image to the world. He also expressed gratitude to the Pakistan armed forces, who safeguarded the country’s borders and protected its sovereignty. “While we celebrate our freedom, we also remember the brave people of the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK) and Palestine who have been fighting for their right to self-determination for over seven decades and are facing the worst form of state atrocities,” he remarked and reiterated Pakistan’s continuous moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle their universal right to self-determination. The prime minister said that Pakistan would also continue its support for the oppressed Palestinians for their legitimate rights. “Pakistan stands at a crossroads today. While the common values, rich cultural heritage and diverse traditions continue to bind us together, our economy continues to face significant challenges in the shape of inflation, high-energy costs, unemployment and a growing debt burden.” He said that since assuming power after the February 2024 elections, the government’s consistent focus was on creating the right conditions for economic growth and stability. He said that Pakistan’s rich natural resources and a youthful workforce were true assets. He said the government was taking steps to attract investments to take full advantage of these resources to create job opportunities, speed the pace of industrialization, and bring economic prosperity. The government’s focus is also on education and skill development that will further empower our youth and equip them with the tools needed in the competitive global economy, he added. “I am personally supervising the national drive to digitize the entire ecosystem and broaden the tax base so that we can provide relief to those already paying taxes…The government is working hard to bring down the prices of electricity and the nation will see the results soon,” he remarked.  — Additional input from APP."

  "content": "Four Pakistan Army soldiers embraced martyred while six terrorists were killed during a gun battle between the miscreants and the security forces in South Waziristan, a statement issued by the military's media affairs wing said late Tuesday night. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR): “On night 12/ 13 August 2024, fire exchange took place between the security forces and Khwarij in South Waziristan District.” “Resultantly, six Khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops.” However, during the intense fire exchange, four soldiers — Havildar Nisar Hussain, 34, resident of District Kurram; Naik Rashid Gul, 34, resident of District Kurram; Naik Irfan Ullah Khan, 30, resident of District Lakki Marwat and Sepoy Usman Rafaqat, 21, resident of District Haripur — having fought gallantly embraced Shahadat. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other “Kharji” found in the area as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism. “Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the military’s media wing added. Following the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has experienced a tidal wave of terrorist attacks on security forces, particularly in provinces bordering the neighbouring country, with militants employing advanced weaponry and equipment. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), Annual Security report, during the second quarter of the current year, Pakistan witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terror operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counterterrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir has said that no force can break the relationship of trust and love between the people and the armed forces, terming the nation’s trust in the military as the most valuable asset. He stated this while addressing the Azadi Parade at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul on the eve of Independence Day late Tuesday. The parade was held at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) Kakul to mark the 78th Independence Day. The army chief said weakening the armed forces is tantamount to weakening the country, pledging that the military will not allow let its sacrifices to go in vain.  “We emerge as a strong nation after trial and tribulations. To weaken Pakistan's armed forces is tantamount to weakening the country itself.\" He said the armed forces will not let sacrifices of their martyrs to go waste and added that the nation's unwavering trust in the Pakistan Army is the military's most valuable asset. “Neither any negative force has ever been able to weaken this relationship of trust and love nor can it do so in future,” he said adding that the armed forces have taken an oath to defend the country internally and externally. Referring to the crises being faced by the country, the COAS said: “Historically, we as a nation have always emerged stronger after every hardship.” Mutual trust between the nation and the armed forces played key role in this regard, he added. The army chief was of the view that internal conflicts and chaos weakened the country and paved the way for external aggression.  “Pakistan came into being to stand out among the comity of nations. Pakistan is a fait accompli and it cannot be undone,” the army chief stated. Gen Munir said the country's people “are living as a free nation owing to the martyrs' sacrifices”. Gen Munir said that the base of our national consciousness is the ideology of Pakistan, which stands on the two-nation theory. “May the Almighty Allah grant us the courage and strength to defend the country and make it a successful and great example for future generations.” The army chief said that the two-nation theory provided an opportunity to the Muslims of the subcontinent to have separate identity, culture and civilization. The COAS said the menace of terrorism was once again rearing head in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to the anti-state activities of “Fitna-ul-Khawarij”.  In a move to shift its war on terror from a physical to an ideological front, the government last month categorised the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as “Fitna ul-Khawarij”. Gen Munir said he had earlier said about the fitna that \"If you do not follow the Sharia and the Constitution of Pakistan, then we also do not consider you as a Pakistani”. Lauding the sacrifices rendered by the people in KP, the COAS said: “The entire nation salutes them and is indebted to them.” Lauding the brotherly countries for their continuous economic and moral support on international forums, the army chief remarked: “We are grateful to China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey, who always support Pakistan in every difficult time.” In a strong and clear message to Pakistan’s enemies, the COAS said: “Whether it is conventional or unconventional war, dynamic or proactive war strategy, our response will be swift and painful.” Moving on to Kashmir issue, the army chief reiterated Pakistan's moral, political and diplomatic support to the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their legitimate struggle for right to self-determination. The army chief was the chief guest of the Azadi Parade ceremony. The cadets of the Pakistan Military Academy presented a spectacular demonstration of their skills in the drill parade. On this occasion, a special tribute was presented to the martyrs of the land."

  "content": "A day after the arrest of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid by the military, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has called the development the Pakistan Army's \"internal affair\", saying the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) does not comment on such matters. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday announced that the former ISI chief was taken into custody over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society in line with the orders of the Supreme Court. \"A detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" read the ISPR's statement. Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Gandapur said that the retired general should face a trial if he has committed any wrongdoing.  However, in his muted response, he underscored the need for \"transparency of trial\" for everyone. It is being reported, he further said, that the former spymaster victimised someone while still holding his official position. Commenting on the development, Independent Senator Faisal Vawada and Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah yesterday linked the former spymaster with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the May 9 incidents. Vawda had told Geo News that the issue of the former general arrest would follow through and lead the May 9 matter to arrive at its logical conclusion. He also predicted the consequences of the August 12 step for the PTI leaders in the coming days. The May 9 events refer to violent protests that broke out in the country following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last year in a corruption case. The violent attacks saw government buildings and military installations including Rawalpindi's General Headquarters (GHQ) and Lahore Corps Commander's House being vandalised by mobs. The former ruling party has distanced itself from the violent protests with its jailed founder Imran Khan recently stating that he was ready to apologise if PTI activists were found involved in the riots.  Referring to his arrest, Chief Minister Gandapur also urged the court to summon him to know \"what he was being pressurised to say\" in custody before the May 9 violent protests.  \"Being an eyewitness, I can tell the court about what the plan was and what steps were taken ahead of May 9,\" he said, claiming that the mayhem following the party founder's arrest was pre-planned.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Expressing grave concerns over the reports of highly radioactive and nuclear substances being stolen in India repeatedly, Islamabad suspects that there is a black market for such sensitive materials in the neighbouring country, saying it is \"dangerous\" that such incidents are frequently taking place. \"Pakistan is gravely concerned at the reports of recurring incidents of theft and illicit sale of nuclear and other radioactive materials in India. In the latest incident, a gang of individuals were found in illegal possession of a highly radioactive and toxic substance Californium, worth $100 million in quantity,\" Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said this in response to a question on Tuesday.  The Indian media reported last week about the arrest of another gang possessing a highly radioactive and toxic substance Californium. Islamabad demanded New Delhi conduct a probe into the frequent instances of “theft and illicit sale” of nuclear and other radioactive materials in India. \"Three incidents of theft of Californium were also reported in 2021,\" the FO spokesperson said, adding that five individuals with a radioactive device reportedly stolen from Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) were also found from Dehradun last month. Islamabad also called into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive substances, stressing that these incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India. After the substance was seized from the smugglers, the Indian authorities informed the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) — the central authority responsible for overseeing nuclear materials in India — to step in for a thorough investigation, given the critical nature of the substance, according to NDTV. In its reaction, Islamabad reiterated its call for a thorough investigation of these incidents and for adequate measures to prevent their recurrence. \"The international community seeks an earnest disclosure from the Indian authorities as to how a sealed Radioactive Source (SRS) material, like Californium, was in the possession of the apprehended individuals. It is dangerous for such sensitive material in India to routinely be found in the wrong hands,\" the FO statement added. "

  "content": "Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman on Tuesday said that his party, days after it reached an agreement with the government and postponed its Rawalpindi sit-in, would once again take to the streets but this time it will join hands with trader groups in its protests. Speaking to the media in Islamabad the JI emir said: \"Consultations are underway with traders. We have several options [....] Will call for peaceful demonstrations together with trade bodies.\" Last week, the party announced deferring its 14-day long sit-in following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers. \"We are deferring and not ending the sit-in,\" the JI chief said while warning that they would stage a sit-in again if the government didn't go through with their agreement. The announcement came after the JI delegation led by Liaquat Baloch held multiple rounds of talks with the government team which eventually culminated in an agreement signed by Information Minister Ataullah Tarar and Interior Minister Moshin Naqvi. Continuing on in his presser today, Hafiz Naeem fired a broadside at the ruling elite for worsening the law and order situation in the country. \"There is no peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Bandits rule in Sindh [whereas] Punjab's situation has also worsened that before,\" the politician said while calling on the rulers to improve the law and order situation. Lamenting the country's prevailing economic situation and its effects on the masses, the JI chief noted that 80% of the youth don't want to live in the country. Commenting on the burden on the inflation-weary masses, the politico said that no one was opposed to broadening the tax net, however, he lamented that taxes were being imposed on the people and further highlighted the concerns of the traders and industrialists. Calling for slashing the taxes imposed on the salaried class, Naeem warned that the party would once again take to the streets if the government failed to implement the agreement with them. \"The government has 40 days left [...] we have several options [to hold] protests,\" he added."

  "content": "Shambeen alias Shahak, a wanted terrorist from Balochistan, was killed by his own accomplice, Geo News reported on Tuesday, citing security sources. The terrorist, according to the sources, belonged to a banned militant organisation, Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and was involved in several terror activities, including attacks on forces. \"Shambeen alias Shahak was involved in attacks on forces as well as the killing of former members who had surrendered, the sources added. The killed terrorist was also directly involved in numerous attacks on security forces in Balochistan.  Responding to a question about whether his killing points towards internal fights between the militant groups, Brigadier (retd) Waqar Hassan told Geo News that these terrorist organisations operating in Pakistan, whether they are doing so in the name of Islam or as nationalist groups, are all basically \"criminal mafia\" and there is no ideology. It is, he added, mainly to create chaos and extortion of money. \"The infighting has been going on for a long time,\" he said, detailing the surrenders made by ex-members of banned militant organisations, Gulzar Imam Shambay and Sarfraz Bangulzai last year. The cracks within these organisations are a result of our intelligence's efforts and infighting due to money.  \"The main reason for infighting is the division of money given to them as funds,\" he said. These organisations will hopefully stop operating if the intensity of infighting increases. Balochistan, which remains a target of terrorist activities, has witnessed several attacks on civilians and security forces. Among the 92% fatalities recorded as a result of terrorist attacks, the province suffered 25% of all deaths in the second quarter of 2024, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw 67% lives lost to terrorism."

  "content": "KARACHI: As opposition parties continue to seek fresh polls in the country, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that holding fresh elections will not solve problems faced by the country.  Instead, the army chief, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) and politicians should figure out how to run the country's affairs, said the top leader of newly launched political party Awam Pakistan.  \"Even fresh polls won't solve the problems in the country. Army chief, CJP and politicians should sit together and find a way to run the country,\" Abbasi said while speaking to journalists outside an accountability court on Monday.  It may be noted that political rivals of the ruling coalition — Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) — have time and again called for holding polls anew.  Political parties including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F), Jamat-e-Islami (JI) alleged vote rigging, interference, and manipulation in the poll results in the February 8 elections. Abbasi's statement about the fresh polls came after the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) withdrew a reference against the ex-premier. Referring to the graft reference pertaining to illegal appointments in Pakistan State Oil (PSO), the ex-premier said that the statement of only a single witness was recorded against him in four years. He said that the reference was not related to corruption and the anti-graft body misused their power by filing the reference against him.  Abbasi went on to say that \"the sooner NAB is abolished the better it would be for the country\". \"Such cases are started under political engineering. Today is a day to celebrate as the court exonerated us from the charges,\" he added. The former PM and others were accused of illegally appointing a former managing director of PSO, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer, in a supplementary reference filed in 2020 with the LNG terminal case. An accountability court in Karachi acquitted Abbasi and others in the LNG case in April this year."

  "content": "Minutes after the Pakistan Army issued public statement on the arrest of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, Senator Faisal Vawda welcomed the step, warning the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf of imminent consequences in the coming days. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced the arrest of the former ISI chief, saying that he was taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said. The ISPR said appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. Giving his reaction to the development, Senator Vawda said: \"This is just the beginning; many big figures are about to fall.\"  Terming the development as \"excellent decision\" taken for the sake of the country, Vawda said whoever caused any harm to the country will be held accountable. \"The process of accountability will be seen in the country,\" he noted. He also claimed that the PTI and the former spy chief are two sides of the same coin, claiming that the incarcerated party founder Imran Khan and his party will face the music in the coming days.  The former PTI leader underscored the need for everyone to let institutions to do their official work. The army's surprise action against the former ISI boss has left the PTI “politically orphan,” Vawda added. Meantime, Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah also welcomed Hamid's arrest, saying the step will help enhance the Pakistan Army's goodwill and respect. The process of court martial will make headway as per the military's law, he said, adding that the former general was one of the signatories of the Faizabad sit-in agreement. He said that people were manipulated to stage the Faizabad sit-in and Hamid had a role in this, adding that the inquiry will expose all the facts in this regard. Commenting on the charges mentioned by the ISPR in connection with today's arrest of the former spy chief, the politico said that the Supreme Court gave its ruling on the petition filed by the housing society owner and the inquiry was also held into the allegations against the former spy chief.  \"Multiple irregularities must have been found in this regard,\" he said, asking to sticking to the ISPR's statement in the matter."

  "content": "Just a couple of months before the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan, Justice Qazi Faez Isa, is set to bid farewell as the country's top judge, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has sought authorities to issue a notification regarding the upcoming CJP. \"The PTI demands notification regarding the next CJP be issued,\" Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said while talking to the media along with other party leaders on Monday. \"We want to make it abundantly clear that the extension [in the term of the incumbent CJP] is entirely inadmissible.\" The PTI's demand came as Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar clarified last month that Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa was not interested in his extension.    Speaking to Geo News programme Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath on July 13, the law minister had said that CJP Isa had told him [Tarar] in the presence of the attorney general that rumours had been circulating about his [Isa’s] extension, and that even if the rumours were true, he was not interested. The former ruling party's demand regarding the notification of the next top judge is not absolutely unwarranted as the incumbent CJP's name came to the fore on June 21 last year almost over two months before he took oath of his office on September 17, 2023. The incumbent chief justice, Pakistan's 29th CJP, is slated to retire from the top judicial post on October 25, 2024. In today's media interaction, Gohar also expressed reservation over the Supreme Court's ruling that upheld the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) verdict regarding the recount in the National Assembly seats — NA-154, 81 and 79, giving the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) much-needed relief. The country's apex court earlier today overturned the Lahore High Court's (LHC) verdict declaring a recount of votes in the three NA constituencies null where the PML-N's candidates were declared victorious. \"The members of the National Assembly (MNAs) have taken oath and reversing them stands in contradiction to justice,\" he said, adding that the Supreme Court's verdict on the three seats is against what justice requires. The PTI chief announced that the party would file a review petition against the ruling as the party has reservations over the verdict. He dubbed the Supreme Court's ruling as a conspiracy against the party, saying that previously, the party faced a conspiracy that took away its election symbol that would result in the PTI losing seats. However, the people foiled this conspiracy on February 8, he added. \"Next, an attempt was made to deprive the party of reserved seats, however, the party became successful in this matter as well,\" he added. \"Now, another attempt is being made in the form of a \"recount\" to take back the PTI's won seats,.\""

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The military has taken former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general (DG) Lt General (retd) Faiz Hamid into custody and initiated \"the process of Field General Court Martial\" against him, the ISPR said in a statement on Monday. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. Consequently, the ISPR said appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. It added that multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established against the former general, who also served as Peshawar corps commander. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" the ISPR said in the communique. The arrest was made in connection with a petition filed by a housing society's chief executive officer (CEO) in the Supreme Court last year, wherein the former ISI chief was accused of land grabbing and stealing valuables during a raid. In a plea filed with the apex court's human rights cell (HRC) in November 2023 the petitioner had sought action against the former DG ISI. \"After the raid, I along with my five other colleagues were kept in confinement. The federal government should take action against Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid, his brother Najaf and others,\" the petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan had stated in his petition. A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aminuddin Khan heard the matter. The bench disposed of the petition on November 8, 2023 and directed the petitioner to approach the relevant forum against the retired general. In the written order, the bench stated that the applicant had alleged that Lt Gen (retd) Hamid, who was then serving in the armed forces and working with the ISI, misused his office, and on his directions crimes were committed against the applicant and his family, as under:  The written order further stated the learned additional attorney general (AAG) stated that there are a number of remedies available to the applicant, including approaching the Ministry of Defence as the complaint/grievance pertains to a period when the said respondents were serving officers in the Armed Forces and/or to file a criminal case, including one for malicious prosecution, and/or to file a suit for damages, or to do all these.” “The learned AAG also stated that if a complaint is addressed to the Ministry of Defence of the Government of Pakistan it will be given due consideration,” says the order, adding “the allegations are of an extremely serious nature, and if true, undoubtedly would undermine the reputation of the Federal Government, the Armed Forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.” Lt Gen (retd) Hamid had sought early retirement in November 2022 and his request was approved by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in December. He was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by the General Headquarters in the list of potential candidates for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC). The ex-DG ISI had served as Peshawar and Bahawalpur corps commander before his retirement."

  "content": "Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari has revealed details regarding the murder case of 20-year-old Syeda Sania Zehra, a pregnant mother of two — was found dead at her residence in Multan last month. The provincial minister, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, said that the woman's death was not a result of suicide but that of homicide. The victim, who was found dead hanging by a ceiling on July 9, was alleged to have been killed by her husband — a claim her father, who was a complainant in the initial first information report, has repeatedly made. Bokhari, however, has said that the suspect is, in fact, the culprit along with his mother, as all evidence points towards their role in Zehra's killing. \"No evidence of suicide has been found in the Sania Zehra case. The mother-in-law and husband had put a noose around the girl's neck together,\" she said during the presser. The minister made the revelation two days after the Punjab government constituted a six-member committee to oversee probe in the murder case. The committee, comprising forensic experts, was formed after discrepancies found in the FIR's contents and victim's post-mortem report, adding fuel to controversies. The committee was tasked with monitoring the investigation on a daily basis. The minister, addressing the press conference — flanked by Chairperson of the Women Protection Authority Hina Pervaiz Butt — said that the wounds on the girl's shoulder and neck are not due to the noose. Bokhari, who mentioned being a criminal lawyer herself, said a homicide case can longer be forged as one of suicide. \"Forensic lab traces such cases. Forensics have found evidence against Sania's mother-in-law and husband.\" She insisted that the suspect tried very hard to escape and there was immense pressure with regard to the case. \"Now, permission won't be given by hiding one's crime after killing women,\" she added. Butt also endorsed Bokhari's statement, saying that she knew it was not a suicide case after seeing photographs of the crime scene. \"Evidence later revealed that the girl was murdered and hanged. Mother-in-law and husband polygraph test positive.\" Meanwhile, the central police officer overseeing the case said that the Punjab Forensic Science Agency also submitted all its test reports, stating that the forensics found no evidence of suicide. \"All the tests and investigations show that it is not a case of suicide. Sania Zehra was killed on July 9 and her [murder] was presented as a suicide,\" he said. According to the forensic report, Zehra's neck was not swollen nor was it elongated due to the noose. \"The DNA of Sania's husband and mother-in-law matched with the dupatta used as the noose.\" As per the report, the noose around Zehra's neck did not cause her death and that the scar on the neck and shoulder was not because of the dupatta. \"The DNA of the sample found from Sania's nail was also matched with that of her husband,\" it read. According to the first information report (FIR) filed by her father Syed Asad Abbas Shah, the victim was found hanging from a ceiling fan after her family reached her residence upon receiving a call from the police at 9am on July 9, 2024. Her husband and in-laws were alleged to have been involved in the murder of the young mother, whose father filed a complaint against them under sections 302 (intentional murder), 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the New Multan police station. According to a forensic specialist, present at the scene, the noose around the victim's neck easily opened up when attempted to be untied. The doctor dealing with the matter, on the other hand, said the victim had passed away at 6pm that day. The victim's jaw was also broken and marks of a rope were also visible on her feet, the complainant mentioned citing the doctor in the FIR, adding that the there were signs of torture on her body with both eye and ribs bruised and elbows injured. Zehra, when found dead, was five to six months pregnant. Meanwhile, the suspect in the case — her husband — had fled the scene without informing his wife's family. The victim's father, denying that Zehra died of suicide, insisted that his daughter was killed by her husband who wanted her property. The case garnered immense traction on social media with people calling for justice, seeking punishment for the perpetrators. The case Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz then instructed Provincial Minister for Social Welfare and Finance Punjab Sohail Shaukat Butt and Chairperson Women Protection Authority MPA Hina Parvez Butt to meet the grieving family in Multan following which an investigation into the case was initiated via a joint investigation team. After a court order, the police exhumed the victim's body on July 13 and collected the samples of a post-mortem for a forensic report to probe the murder. The cause of her death, after a few days, was established as asphyxia due to hanging. On July 20, the victim's husband and murder suspect — Ali Raza — was arrested after the Multan police registered a different case against him after he was released in the first FIR. The new FIR against the husband invoked PPC Sections 468 (forgery), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 471 (using forged document as genuine), 494 (marrying again during lifetime of spouse) and 495 (concealment of former marriage from person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted). According to the new FIR, the victim's husband had declared himself single in their marriage certificate, even though he was a married man and a father of two daughters. Later after securing bail, Raza held a press conference at the Multan Press Club, insisting that his wife had committed suicide. According to the suspect, he and Zehra had a heated argument on July 8 after which he slept in another room. In the morning, he said, the wife did not respond after he knocked to opened the room's door, following which he found her hanging by the ceiling fan. After the presser, he was yet again arrested by the police."

  "content": "In a concerning development for the ruling coalition, the Muttahi Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has warned that it will have no reason to be part of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led administration if any unilateral decision is made regarding the office of Sindh governor. MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar, stressing that the said Constitutional post belongs to his party, said: \"It was decided [in meetings] with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that Kamran Tessori would remain the governor.\" Sattar's remarks come in the backdrop of ongoing ambiguity surrounding Tessori's future after last week sources told Geo News that the PML-N-led federal government had come to terms with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which rules Sindh, to replace Tessori with ex-Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) chief Bashir Memon. However, the rumours didn't sit well with the MQM-P as Tessori doubled down on those spreading such reports and said that he enjoyed the confidence of PM Shehbaz, President Asif Ali Zardari and his own party and would continue to serve the people till the time he is in office. \"I would tell those behind these reports that I am not the one who gets panicked [by such reports],\" he said. Meanwhile, Sattar outrightly dismissed the rumours, saying: \"No one talked to us nor did any consultation take place.\" The former Karachi mayor's views were echoed by his colleague Khawaja Izharul Hassan, who also dismissed the potential removal of Tessori, citing a social contract which provisioned representation of the province's urban areas via the governor when the chief minister belonged to the rural areas. However, presenting the Centre's point of view on the matter, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar has said that a decision on the issue of the Sindh governor post is expected soon.  However, he refuted the reports suggesting the appointment of PML-N's Memon for the said post. It is to be noted that the MQM-P played a key role in the ousting of the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government after it decided to part ways with the government to support the Pakistan Democratic Movement's (PDM) vote of no-confidence against the then prime minister Imran Khan in April 2022. The Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui-led party was subsequently a part of the PDM government. It was once again wooed by the PML-N to join them in the Centre following the February 8 polls where no party managed to secure a simple majority in the National Assembly. The MQM-P, which currently has 21 seats in the lower house of parliament — 17 general and four reserved — is a key ally of the PML-N-led government whose future hangs in a delicate balance owing to the slim majority of the ruling coalition, especially after the July 12 Supreme Court verdict that not only resurrected the PTI in the assemblies but also declared it eligible for reserved seats. Therefore, the loss of the MQM-P's support by the PML-N might have drastic consequences for the incumbent government and the political landscape altogether."

  "content": "SHIGAR: In a tragic event, mountaineer Murad Sadpara has breathed his last after getting seriously injured on his way back from Broad Peak, the Broad Peak Rescue Team said on Monday. According to Geo News, the rescue team reached the Camp One on Monday and confirmed Sadpara's death. The 35-year-old mountaineer had led the K2 cleanup expedition this year during which he successfully retrieved the body of mountaineer Hasan Shagri, who had died last year. A few days later, Sadpara left the base camp to summit Broad Peak, the 12th highest mountain in the world, with a Portuguese mountaineer. However, on their way, his fellow mountaineer fell sick and the pair decided to head back to base camp. Unfortunately, on their way back, Sadpara was seriously injured after a rock hit his head at Camp One and passed away while awaiting his rescue. Sadpara's body has been shifted to the Japanese camp, and it will be moved to the base camp by 2pm today from where it will be transported to Skardu via an army helicopter, rescue sources said. Two more climbers have reached the base camp by helicopter. Four members of the rescue team had left the base camp at 1am on Monday. President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed deep sorrow over Sadpara's passing, while extending his deepest sympathies to the mountaineer's bereaved family members. The president recognised Sadpara's achievements in mountaineering and prayed for his forgiveness and strength for his grieving family. Last year, Sadpara had brought down the body of an Afghan mountaineer from Camp Three. He used to spend his time mountain climbing in summers and driving tractors in winters. He has three daughters and a son."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday overturned the Lahore High Court's (LHC) verdict that nullified a vote recount in three National Assembly constituencies won by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidates. The 2-1 majority reserved verdict was announced by a three-member SC bench  headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa in response to the pleas filed by the PML-N leaders.  However, Justice Aqeel Abbasi dissented with the decision in favour of PML-N candidates Azhar Qayyum Nahra, Abdul Rehman Kanju and Zulfikar Ahmed.

Accordingly, the above civil petitions are dismissed and leave to appeal refused,\" said the verdict.   The development comes after the three leaders, who had lost from their respective constituencies, had requested for the recounting of votes after which the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) declared them winners. However, the election body's decision was challenged by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the LHC which, in April, overturned the election outcome.  The independent candidates then challenged the ECP's decision in the LHC which, in April, overturned the election outcome. The PML-N candidates then approached the SC against the verdict given by the LHC. Following this, the three-member bench reinstated them as NA members and declared LHC's decision null and void. The request for a recount in the constituencies of NA-154 (Lodhran), NA-81 (Gujranwala), and NA-79 (Gujranwala) was submitted to the top court, resulting in this decision. "

  "content": "Consul General of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Karachi Dr Bakheet Ateeq Al Remeithi has explained the reasons which could cause obstacles in the issuance of visas for Pakistanis to Gulf country. Speaking no Geo News' programme \"Geo Pakistan\" on Monday, the diplomat said: \"Regardless of which social media platform you use either in Pakistan or UAE, whatever you share or like leaves a digital footprint [...] whether you share, liked something good or bad [....] these things will lead to your ban [or visa rejection].\" Last week, Dr Al Remeithi had dismissed the reports suggesting that there were restrictions on visa issuance to Pakistanis by the UAE after emerged that the residents of Sindh were facing difficulty in acquiring the Gulf country's visa. The Gulf nation has warned Pakistani expats living there against spreading propaganda against their country, institutions, or politicians with Dr Al Remeithi confirming that the country has arrested many Pakistanis of which five have been sentenced to 14 to 15 years in jail. Last month, Secretary Overseas Pakistanis Dr Arshad briefed the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis about the problems that other nations have with Pakistanis underscored the Pakistani diaspora's work ethics-related and revealed that it was responsible for an alarming 50% of the total crime in the UAE. Elaborating on his government's concerns and policies regarding visa issuance, the Gulf nation's envoy complained that people from some nations indulge in riots if the situation in their home country deteriorates and remarked that \"people have to go to hospitals, there can be some other emergencies [...] this shouldn't happen\". \"People work round the clock here [...] blocking roads, and spreading misinformation about someone else is not part of the UAE's culture. Our laws and regulations don't allow this at all,\" the consul general said. Noting that the UAE government doesn't want people to bring their home country's issues and politics there, Dr Al Remeithi said that their government has tried to bring awareness to the Pakistani diaspora to be careful of these things. Linking visa issuance with people's social media activity, the diplomat confirmed that the UAE authorities do in fact scrutinise and assess visa applicants' social media activity and advised the people to be careful about their digital footprint as every individual is a representative of their country. Responding to a question about whether people's Instagram, Facebook and X accounts can cause hindrances in the issuance of their visas, the envoy answered in the affirmative and said: \"Yes absolutely that's true\". Explaining what the people should be careful about, he warned them against talking negatively about their home country in the UAE and abstain from talking on issues that have the element of incitement. \"Go enjoy your life, take your families, indulge in shopping or travel. Whatever you want to do we are with you,\" he said. \"We have helped and facilitated many people and issued visas to those who travel to the UAE for travel. \"We always think highly of Pakistanis [....] Some people have created a narrative that Pakistani people create problems. It's not like that, Pakistanis are [in fact] great people,\" the envoy added. Taking the moment to ride on the Arshad Nadeem hype train, the consul general lauded the Olympic gold medallist for bringing honour and pride to the country and that too just days ahead of the Independence day When asked whether a fixed quota was fixed for visas, the consul general replied in the negative and disclosed that the Gulf nation had issued as many as 70,000 work visas to Pakistanis in the last year and a half. Assuring that the Pakistani business committee was being facilitated in the UAE, Dr Al Remeithi lauded the work being done by the Pakistani expats in the construction industry and advised the country's youth to focus on information technology (IT) and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors as there were many opportunities in the UAE in these fields. \"The Pakistani youth should focus on the field of medicine as there are many opportunities for doctors in UAE,\" he said. Noting that his government was trying to facilitate Pakistanis regarding visa services and document verification, the consul general said that people from Pakistan can reach out to them directly for information even if they don't have an appointment."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The city administration in the Islamabad Capital Territory has prohibited the sale, purchase and use of honking toy horns in the federal capital ahead of the Independence Day as the nation gears up for celebrations.  A notification issued by Islamabad Additional District Magistrate Usman Ashraf Sunday stated that the ban comes into immediate effect and will remain imposed for the ten days.  It further stated that the ban has been imposed under Section 144 as local traders sell celebratory items including flags, badges and other goods on roadside stalls ahead of the Independence Day. \"[...] Additional district magistrate, Islamabad, [...]do hereby prohibit the stock, sale, purchase and use of horns/whistles in Islamabad, which is likely to disturb public peace and tranquility and also cause public nuisance within the revenue limits of Islamabad District,\" the notification read.  The notification stated that it has been brought to the administration's notice that the noise of toy horns which are being sold in the federal capital causes disruption in the flow of vehicular traffic. Meantime, Islamabad's Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz also called on the citizens to avoid using horns and asked stall-owners to stop selling them. He also directed all assistant commissioners to take all such honking toys being sold on stalls into their custody. \"Using or selling a toy horn it can land you in legal trouble,\" the official said while requesting the citizens to comply with the directives.  Last year, a judicial magistrate's court in Karachi had ordered to take action against sellers of toy horn sellers and those who use them as the nation neared its Independence Day. A year earlier in 2022, a citizen, tired of all the noise during Independence Day celebrations, moved the Lahore High Court (LHC) seeking a ban on using plastic toy horns and whistles. However, the province's top court dismissed his plea. The country is set to mark its 77th Independence Day on Wednesday with traditional zeal and fervour. "

  "content": "Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) has once again criticised his former allies — who now sit in the federal government, calling the members of the parliament \"fake representatives\" of the people. The JUI-F has been demanding to conduct fresh polls to ensure that people have the opportunity to elect their true representatives to the legislature as he is adamant that the February 9 general elections were “rigged.”  After the elections, the JUI-F became estranged from the ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), amid accusations of rigging, interference and manipulation of the 2024 election results.  The cleric, who headed a multi-party opposition alliance — Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — which successfully ousted former prime minister Imran Khan from power via a no-confidence motion in 2022, has also been in talks with the Khan-founded Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), for devising a strategy to force the incumbent government into new elections.    \"Fake representatives of the people are sitting in Parliament, not the real ones, [...] who don't think about the masses,\" Fazl said while addressing a traders' convention in Peshawar. Criticising the government over the country's economic and security situation, the veteran politician stated that if any country in the region was regressing, it was Pakistan. He slammed the government for the increased taxes — something that has irked the inflation-hit masses and opposition parties alike — saying that \"the only thing that has not been taxed yet is breathing\". Among the political opponents of the ruling coalition, Jamat-e-Islami (JI) is also pushing for a reduction in taxes. The party recently ended its nearly two-week-long protest sit-in in Rawalpindi following \"successful negotiations\" with the federal government. \"Why should we pay the taxes when people know their money will be used to repay foreign loans,\" he stated, adding, \"This is not how the countries are run, politicians run the country.\" In his ongoing criticism of the ruling coalition, Fazl, whose party was once a close ally of PML-N and PPP, stated: \"I had informed Mian Sahib (Nawaz Sharif) the country’s economy has collapsed.\" He asked why sub-standard wheat was imported when the farmers in the country had it in stock. The JUI-F chief then called for the facilitation of the traders and farmers, saying that the country wouldn't stabilise as long as its economy was not strong. Fazl also took exception to the choice of finance ministers in the past. He said that the portfolio of the finance ministry \"is given to the ones who have been imported\". \"A person became Pakistan's premier out of nowhere; we don't know where he came from,\" said Rehman alluding to former prime minister Moeen Qureshi. \"One was first appointed finance minister, and then he became prime minister, with no one knowing where he came from. The finance portfolio is given to clueless people.\" \"Prime ministers come and go without anyone knowing where they came from and where they went. Someone is on the front, while the strings are pulled by someone else,\" Maulana Fazlur Rehman added without naming anyone. The country, Fazl said, was going through a critical situation and his party could play a role in strengthening the economy. \"Peace and a better economy should be the priorities,\" he added."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government has finally responded to the reports of potential replacement of Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, as Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said that a decision on the matter is expected soon. Reports of a consensus between the coalition partners in the federal government, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), over changing the Sindh governor had run rife recently.  The insiders also said that Tessori could be replaced with PML-N leader and former Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) chief Bashir Memon. However, there was no official word on the matter until today (Sunday).   FM Dar refuted the reports of Memon's appointment as Sindh governor, but said a decision will be made in regard with the Tessori's replacement will be made soon. Meanwhile, sources said that the PML-N is holding consultation with the coalition partner PPP on the matter.  On Saturday, Tessori vowed to continue serving as Sindh governor amid replacement reports, saying that he will continue to be in people's service.  \"The positions keep coming and going but I will continue to serve the people till I am on the governor's post,\" he said in response to the questions regarding his potential replacement. The Sindh governor said that he enjoyed the confidence of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and MQM-P chief Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. \"I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Sindh governor,\" he added. Earlier, sources had said that a change in the governor's office is likely to take place in the coming days. They said that the PML-N leadership contacted the PPP's top leaders on Friday and discussed the matter. In April, the sources claimed that former Sindh caretaker chief minister Justice (retired) Maqbool Baqar could be appointed as the new governor of the province. Responding to one such report, MQM-P leader Khajawa Izharul Hassan had also dismissed the potential removal of Tessori, citing a social contract. Hassan had said that according to the social contract, the governor should be the representative of urban Sindh if the elected chief minister repeatedly belonged to the rural areas of the province, adding that the appointment of the incumbent governor [Tessori] was fully in harmony with the prevailing social contract in the province. Moreover, a PPP leader Waqar Mehdi on April 12 this year declared Tessori as the \"biggest failure as governor\" in the history of the province, saying he had failed to discharge his due role as he, being the representative of the federation in the province, was supposed to develop consensus on political issues. PPP Sindh General Secretary Waqar Mehdi had called upon the PML-N ruling in the Centre to immediately finalise its nominee as the new governor of Sindh. “Kamran Tessori better go on leave until the PML-N chooses the new governor for Sindh.”.

  "content": "LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reassured the minority communities residing in Pakistan, saying that the federal government will take all possible measures to provide equal opportunities for them and protect their rights.  In his statement on National Minorities Day, commemorating the founder of the nation's historic August 11, 1947 speech advocating equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion, PM Shehbaz emphasised, \"The constitution of Pakistan guarantees the rights of minorities.\" The rights would be protected as enshrined in the Constitution and as per wisdom of Quaid-e-Azam, he added.   He made these remarks during a gathering at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) headquarters on Sunday. Highlighting the significance of the day, he stressed that Quaid-e-Azam had envisioned a Pakistan where everyone, including Muslims and minorities, would enjoy complete freedom to practice their faiths — a vision that continues to guide the country today. The premier condemned the ongoing violence in Gaza, denouncing the atrocities committed by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Netanyahu. PM Shehbaz criticised the global community's muted response to these acts, calling it a grave failure of international organisations tasked with maintaining global peace. Reflecting on the contributions of the country's minority communities, he acknowledged their significant role in the country's progress and prosperity. He highlighted the contributions of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh, and Parsi communities to various sectors, including education, defence, trade, and justice. The premier paid special tribute to minority figures who served the nation in both war and peace, highlighting examples such as Cecil Chaudhry and Justice Cornelius. PM Shehbaz also recognised the challenges faced by minorities in Pakistan, highlighting the need for ongoing efforts by both the federal and provincial governments to ensure their security and protection. He reassured the minority communities that the government is committed to addressing their concerns and improving their quality of life. He reiterated the PML-N's longstanding support for minority rights, stating that the party, under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, has always advocated for the inclusion and protection of minorities. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Ch Salik Hussain also spoke on the occasion. Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique and other federal and provincial ministers, parliamentarians, representatives of minorities and senior civil and forces officers attended the ceremony."

  "content": "President Asif Ali Zardari has said the government is committed to protect the religious rights and freedoms of minorities in Pakistan, as the country observes Minorities’ Day today. The president, in his special message for the occasion on Sunday, said: \"On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to the promise made by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, on August 11, 1947, to the country’s minorities to protect their rights and religious freedoms. The president added that the government has taken a number of steps for the political, social and economic empowerment of minorities. He said that Islam, too, fully recognises and advocates the protection of the rights of minorities. President Zardari went on to say that the government has allocated a 5% quota for minorities for jobs and separate seats in both houses of parliament to encourage them to play an effective role in the political and national development of the country. Additionally, he said steps are being taken to provide financial assistance to poor and deserving individuals, marriage grants, scholarships to students from minority communities for their education, besides the provision of funds for the repair/maintenance of their worship places. He said Pakistan was committed to ensuring the protection of religious, social, political and economic rights of its minorities, adding that every Pakistani has the right to live according to their faith, irrespective of their religion, caste, colour or creed. “I urge all segments of society, including the religious scholars, representatives of minorities and the media to educate the people about their rights and work for promoting interfaith harmony, the spirit of love, tolerance, brotherhood and unity to make Pakistan a strong country.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on the occasion, paid tribute to minorities for their outstanding role in the country's development and prosperity. He said that the purpose of celebrating the day is to express solidarity with the minorities living in Pakistan and to acknowledge their services for the state of Pakistan. PM Shehbaz said that the minority community played a key role in the Pakistan Movement and since the creation of Pakistan, has been contributing immensely to the nation building. Alluding to the historic speech of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on August 11, 1947, PM Shehbaz said that complete religious freedom has been given to minorities. He expressed commitment to protect the rights of minorities and their overall development and prosperity. Meanwhile, the armed forces of Pakistan, the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee, and the services chiefs also extended warm felicitations to the minority communities of Pakistan on their dedicated day, acknowledging their indispensable contributions to the nation's progress, prosperity, and rich cultural heritage. A statement released by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read that this occasion serves as a poignant reminder of the diversity, inclusivity, and harmonious coexistence that are the hallmarks of our great nation. \"The minority communities are an integral and vital part of our social fabric, and their rights and freedoms are sacrosanct, as enshrined in the Constitution and Islam,\" the statement stated. It added that minorities, throughout Pakistan's history, have played a significant role in shaping the country's cultural identity, contributing to its development, and strengthening its social foundations. \"From the Quaid's visionary ideals to the present day, minorities have been an integral part of the nation-building process, and their sacrifices and contributions are deeply valued,\" the ISPR said. The communique further maintained that the country's armed forces honour the unwavering commitment, dedication, and sacrifices of the minority communities, recognising their unshakeable loyalty to the nation and their invaluable role in fostering a cohesive and pluralistic society. \"We celebrate their spirit and reiterate our commitment to protecting and promoting their rights, freedoms, and welfare,\" it added. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in his message on the occasion, said minorities have a key role in the development and prosperity of Pakistan. The minister paid tribute to minority communities in Pakistan for playing a positive role in the country's development, stressing that their role cannot be ignored. \"The government is trying to eliminate discrimination and promote social harmony,\" he added.  — Additional input by APP"

  "content": "Faisalabad police have introduced the first all-female “Dolphin Squad” in a bid to empower women in the district. This will be the first-of-its-kind squad in Faisalabad that is entirely based on female officers and they will perform duties previously done by their male counterparts.  The empowering female-squad is set to significantly boost women all across the country by combatting those who disrupt the order of peace on a day-to-day routine.  To make the women officers equipped with the task, they have undergone special training in operating 500cc heavy bikes and automatic weapons to help them perform their tasks. The all-female Dolphin Squad will work alongside their male counterparts. The team will include 500 women commandos and will be responsible for setting up roadblocks and conducting snap checks on the streets of Faisalabad. The CPO of Faisalabad has relayed that the female Dolphin Squad will be initially deployed and will patrol public places where women are present in great numbers such as universities and markets.  This will provide both the women on duty and doing their errands a sense of ease and will enable them to comfortably convey their issues — if any arise — in public places to the female Dolphin Squad.

  "content": "KARACHI: Kamran Tessori has said that he will continue to fulfill his responsibilities as the Sindh governor as long he is in this role amid reports that the federal government is mulling replacing the top provincial official.  The statement came in response to the reports of a consensus among the coalition partners in the federal government, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), on changing the Sindh governor.   \"The positions keep coming and going but I will continue to serve the people till I am on the governor's post,\" he said on Saturday while responding to the questions regarding his potential replacement. Tessori said that he enjoyed the confidence of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan's (MQM-P) chief Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. \"I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Sindh governor,\" he added. Tessori, who belongs to MQM-P, claimed that the reports of changing the governor surfaced after his meeting with the prime minister last night (Friday). \"I would tell those behind these reports that I am not the one who gets panic [by such reports],\" the governor added. Sattar, who flanked Tessori during the media talk, said that rumours regarding the replacement of the Sindh governor keep circulating. \"No one talked to us nor any consultation took place,\" he added. Last night, the sources had said that a change in the governor's office is likely to take place in the coming days. They said that the PML-N leadership contacted the PPP's top leaders on Friday and discussed the matter. The insiders said it was likely that Tessori could be replaced with PML-N leader and former Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) chief Bashir Memon. Memon was appointed the PML-N Sindh's president on November 7, 2023, while Tessori took the oath of his office on October 10, 2022. However, an MQM-P spokesperson refuted all such reports. In April, the sources claimed that former Sindh caretaker chief minister Justice (retired) Maqbool Baqar could be appointed as the new governor of the province. Responding to one such report, MQM-P leader Khajawa Izharul Hassan had also dismissed the potential removal of Tessori, citing a social contract. Hassan had said that according to the social contract, the governor should be the representative of urban Sindh if the elected chief minister repeatedly belonged to the rural areas of the province, adding that the appointment of the incumbent governor [Tessori] was fully in harmony with the prevailing social contract in the province. Moreover, a PPP leader Waqar Mehdi on April 12 this year declared Tessori as the \"biggest failure as governor\" in the history of the province, saying he had failed to discharge his due role as he, being the representative of the federation in the province, was supposed to develop consensus on political issues. PPP Sindh General Secretary Waqar Mehdi had called upon the PML-N ruling in the Centre to immediately finalise its nominee as the new governor of Sindh. “Kamran Tessori better go on leave until the PML-N chooses the new governor for Sindh.”.

  "content": "Supreme Court's senior puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has warned of dire consequences of not implementing the apex court's verdicts, saying that it would disturb the balance of the Constitution of Pakistan.  \"The SC verdict cannot be disregarded or delayed or else the entire legal system will be disrupted and the balance of Constitution will be out if you seek non-implementation of judgments,\" he said Saturday while addressing an event in Islamabad. He said that the \"separation of powers is the core component of democracy\" which shouldn’t be disturbed.  Implementation of apex court orders is not a burden or a courtesy that has to be done, but a constitutional obligation that needs to be fulfilled, he added.    \"This is a delicate equilibrium which needs to be respected. We have an obligation to keep this equilibrium in balance and there shouldn’t be any executive overreach. No one has the choice or the prerogative to second guess if the judgment is right or wrong,\" the justice said. He said that only SC had the prerogative to decide a matter and after that the judgment has to be implemented.  There will be severe consequences if the constitutional duty of implementing the SC's orders is not fulfilled, he added. “I want to underline that Supreme Court’s judgments [always] get implemented and it is the structure of the Constitution,\" Justice Shah said, stressing that there has never been a case where an apex court verdict was not implemented. He said that not implementing the SC rulings would be \"a violation of the Constitution\".  \"There is no choice but to comply with the Supreme Court’s orders,\" he added.  The SC judge further stated that implementation of judgments was the structure of Constitution as the top court draws the authority to decide the matters from the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, instead of any other document \"No one has the choice to call it [SC rulings] 'wrong' or 'not right'. The Constitution says that this is a judgment and it has to be implemented,\" he said.  Justice Shah went on to say that those who have any objection to the Supreme Court's verdict can change the entire structure of the Constitution \"but right now this is how it is\".  He said that disregarding the apex court's rulings was also \"against the separation of powers\".  It may be noted that the ruling parties recently passed the Elections (Second Amendment) Bill, 2024, in parliament which seeks to 'circumvent' the Supreme Court's July 21 ruling that declared Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) a political party and eligible for reserved seats. The apex court’s full bench on July 21 ruled in favour of the Imran Khan-founded party in the reserved seats case, paving the way for its return to the parliament and effectively depriving the PML-N-led coalition government of its two-thirds majority in the parliament. Justice Shah had announced the 8-5 majority verdict of the SC full bench, which declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and minorities."

  "content": "LAHORE: Incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi claimed on Saturday that there would be no political stability in the country without \"accepting\" the embattled party's founder Imran Khan's as \"political reality\". \"Imran Khan is a political reality,\" said Qureshi during an informal interaction with journalists in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat Jail, adding: \"Without accepting this reality, our country cannot achieve political stability.\" Criticising a plethora of cases filed against him after May 9, 2023, riots, the politico said that dozens of cases had been lodged against him within just one year. He added that he had been in politics for 40 years but not a single case was registered against him in the last 39 years. The former ruling party has been facing crackdown for its alleged involvement in the May 9 riots that saw military installations including Rawalpindi's General Headquarters (GHQ) and Lahore Corps Commander's House being vandalised by mobs. He said that slain Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti was \"not anti-Pakistan\" and became a victim of \"cruelty\". The former foreign minister claimed that the trend of labelling everyone \"traitor\" for the last 75 years should be stopped. He urged stakeholders to resolve Balochistan issues via dialogue. Responding to criticism against the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman's nomination as the opposition's mediator, Qureshi said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai \"is a democrat and an individual having democratic and constitutional ideology cannot be labelled 'traitor'\". Khan, who has been behind bars for more than a year, had recently said that he was open to talks with military but only within the ambit provisioned by the Constitution and also promised to apologise if PTI workers were found responsible for the May 9 riots. \"Am I insane to ask our people to attack the army,\" said the cricketer-turned-politician, adding that the PTI workers were not involved in the May 9 riots and they were wrongfully declared \"terrorists\" for staging peaceful protests. In his conversation with the media in Lahore today, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan said that the incarcerated former premier would move court seeking CCTV footage of the May 9 protests. The PTI's top leader said no deal had been struck with anyone. He added that Khan had stressed that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were trying to create rifts between the nation and the army. Moving further, he claimed this was the year of a fresh election, and that's why the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should be independent. Ayub's recent claim echoed his party founder's statement, who said that the incumbent government led by the PML-N is only left with two months in power. The PTI founder had categorically rejected the acceptance of an interim setup under the supervision of the incumbent government and any electoral event organised by the present CEC."

  "content": "President Asif Ali Zardari will award javelin ace Arshad Nadeem Hilal-e-Imtiaz for clinching a gold medal for Pakistan and setting a new record at the Paris Olympics 2024.  A special ceremony — recognising the 27-year-old athlete's distinguished services in the field of sports — will be held, wherein he will be awarded the second-highest civilian honour. In this regard, Aiwan-e-Sadr has sent a letter to the Cabinet Division on Zardari's directives. The letter highlights Nadeem's exceptional performance, which has brought great pride to the nation. His remarkable achievements on the global stage have become a source of national pride, as he has significantly elevated Pakistan's status in the field of athletics. The president will bestow the civilian award on Nadeem under Article 259(2) of the Constitution, which allows the President to honour citizens for their valuable contributions across various fields. Nadeem won the Olympic men’s javelin title in Paris on Thursday, beating defending champion Neeraj Chopra of India to secure Pakistan's first individual medal at a Summer Games. The six-feet-three-inch-tall Nadeem made the country proud by hurling the javelin to 92.97 metres, improving the Olympic record by over 2.50 metres, and forcing the packed-to-capacity crowd to give him a standing ovation. Before Arshad’s remarkable victory, Pakistan had never won an individual gold medal at the Olympics. All of Pakistan’s previous three gold medals came in field hockey, with their team winning gold in 1960, 1968, and 1984. Prior to Thursday, only two Pakistan athletes had won individual medals of any colour — with a wrestling bronze in 1960 and a boxing bronze in 1988. Since the 1992 Barcelona Games, Pakistan has not won a medal of any kind. Speaking exclusively to Geo News, Pakistani ace javelin thrower said: “It was my day. I could have thrown at a greater distance.” This outstanding achievement has elevated Pakistan’s status on the global sports stage. The 27-year-old will be returning to his hometown, Lahore, via Istanbul at night when the clock marks 1am on Sunday. Nadeem’s hometown, Khanewal, is very excited to celebrate his triumph in grand style."

Speaking to the media in Lahore on Saturday, Ayub said: \"Politicians are also bound to do their politics within the constitutional parameters\". His remarks come as the former ruling party has been in rough waters since May 9, 2023 — the day protests broke out following PTI founder Imran Khan's arrest — as mobs attacked state installations, including the Corps Commander House in Lahore. Khan, who has been behind bars for more than a year, had recently said that he was open to talks but only within the ambit provisioned by the Constitution and also promised to apologise if PTI workers were found responsible for the May 9 riots. \"Am I insane to ask our people to attack the army,\" said Khan, adding that the PTI workers were not involved in the May 9 riots and they were wrongfully declared \"terrorists\" for staging peaceful protests.

Meanwhile, in his conversation with reporters at Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail, PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that he had been in politics for 40 years and for 39 years, no case had been lodged against him — pointing towards dozens of cases registered following May 9. \"Dozens of cases were lodged against me in a year. Now, whether anyone likes it or not, the PTI founder is a reality. There's not going to be stability if they do not accept this reality,\" Qureshi added. Calling for cooling the political heat, the former foreign minister said that the nation's leaders should stop calling their rivals \"traitors\". For 75 years, he said, \"we've been distributing traitor certificates.\""

  "content": "PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has doubled down on its stance on the probe of the May 9 riots and has decided to refer the issue back to the provincial cabinet after the Peshawar High Court (PHC) dismissed the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur-led government's request for investigating May 9 riots. Speaking to Geo News on Saturday, KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel said: \"Have held consultations with KP CM Gandapur after the PHC's response. and it has been decided to take the matter back to the provincial cabinet.\" The advocate general's remarks come after the PHC's registrar — in response to the provincial government's request seeking the constitution of a judicial commission over May 9 incidents — said that the province's request could not be considered as it violates the provisions of the Rules of Business of 1985 and the forum which had written the letter lacked the mandate to do so. The KP government's letter in question, which was also confirmed by provincial Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi last month, had requested the PHC CJ to nominate a judge or judges for the judicial commission as per the decision of the KP cabinet made on June 27, The News reported on Saturday. The former ruling party has been under scrutiny for its alleged involvement in the May 9 riots that saw military installations including Rawalpindi's General Headquarters (GHQ) and Lahore Corps Commander's House being vandalised by mobs. The then-Prime Minister Shehbaz-Sharif-led Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, as well as the incumbent regime, have time again blamed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for orchestrating the riots — an allegation vehemently denied by the former ruling party with its founder Khan saying that he would sack and himself seek punishment for the PTI members if they were found involved in the incidents. The military has also called for the perpetrators of the riots to be punished as per the Constitution and the law of the land to preserve credibility and faith in the country’s justice system. \"Army's stance on [May 9] is clear, which was conveyed in the May 7 [2024] press conference. There has been no change in that nor will there be,\" Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said in a press conference last month. Reiterating the provincial government's stance on the issue, AG Uthmankhel said: \"The chief minister has made it clear that the inquiry will take place no matter what\". Expanding on the PHC's response to their letter, the advocate general said that the court didn't specify what violation had occurred and didn't mention which exact provision of the Rules of Business of 1985 was violated. He claimed that the procedure via which the provincial government sought the constitution of a judicial commission was correct and no such provision exists in the said legislation that was transgressed upon. \"If the high court does not want to do an inquiry, then it should simply refuse,\" he noted. \"The KP government will [obviously] write a letter to the high court through me. The government gave me the responsibility to speak to the court,\" Uthmankhel said, adding that the PHC didn't consult them on the said matter."

  "description": "• ISPs association claims speeds plummeted by 30-40pc in past few weeks • Warns businesses are considering relocating operations to other countries ISLAMABAD: Amid growing concerns from the business community, the internet service providers on Wednesday alleged that the government’s heightened efforts to monitor internet traffic had resulted in a significant nationwide slowdown of services. A statement issued by the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) said the government’s decision to enhance security and surveillance has had an unintended consequence, severely crippling the country’s digital economy. “Over the past few weeks, internet speeds have plummeted by 30 to 40 per cent, creating a chaotic situation for businesses and individuals who rely heavily on fast, reliable connectivity.” The association said the impact had been particularly devastating for call centres, e-commerce professionals, the online working class, and those who manage electronic-related businesses. “These sectors, which form the backbone of Pakistan’s burgeoning digital economy, are now struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival,” it said, adding that the situation had become so dire that many businesses were considering relocating their operations to other countries where internet services remain stable.      “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers,” said WISPAP Chairman Shahzad Arshad. “Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality anymore. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan.” Mr Arshad’s concerns were shared by numerous industry leaders, who cautioned that the current situation is not only tarnishing Pakistan’s reputation as a hub for digital entrepreneurship but also jeopardising its economic stability. The inability to utilise VPNs due to heightened surveillance was further aggravating the issue, especially for international businesses and freelancers who depend on secure, uninterrupted internet access for their operations. “We are seeing businesses planning to shift their operations abroad because the internet is simply no longer reliable,” said a leading e-commerce entrepreneur based in Karachi. “Without fast and secure internet, we cannot compete on a global scale, and this is pushing us towards the brink.” He said the panic within the business community is growing as the government’s measures show­­ed no sign of abating. As the country navigated through these challenging times, the future of Pakistan’s digital landscape hangs in the balance, with businesses and consumers alike bearing the brunt of the slowdown, he regretted.      “While the government remained steadfast in its commitment to enhancing security, the question remained at what cost to the nation’s digital economy? As businesses continued to suffer, there is an urgent need for a solution that balances security concerns with the need for robust and reliable internet access,” he said. Major online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been hit hard, with users reporting slowdowns and difficulties in accessing messaging and social media applications. Some users speculated that the disruptions were the result of a firewall being installed by the government to monitor and keep check on users. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) denied that the issue was caused by a firewall. Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2024 "

  "description": "Freelancing platform Fiverr has made several accounts in Pakistan “unavailable” due to possible “internet disruptions”, workers using the site have said, while rights activists have lamented the issue. A day ago, a body of internet service providers alleged that the government’s heightened efforts to monitor internet traffic had resulted in a significant nationwide slowdown of services. Internet users have speculated that the disruptions were the result of a firewall being installed by the government to monitor and keep check on users. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), however, denied that the issue was caused by a firewall. Last week, users had faced difficulties in accessing social media platforms — though X (formerly Twitter) has already been banned across the country for almost six months citing “security concerns”.      Three Fiverr users confirmed to Dawn.com that they received a notification from the platform that their profiles have been made “unavailable” to clients — seemingly aimed at preventing a user’s profile from receiving negative ratings as a result of inactivity due to possible internet disruptions. However, four Fiverr users across Punjab said they did not receive any such notification, indicating that the platform’s action may be limited to certain cities. “Last week, I received notification on my Fiverr account from Fiverr support telling me that my gigs are made unavailable to clients across the world because Fiverr came to know that there is internet interruption in Pakistan,” Sajid Hussain, a medical content writer based in Punjab, told Dawn.com. Hussain shared screenshots of the email sent by Fiverr on August 1, which stated: “We understand that there may be internet disruptions in your area that might make it harder to keep your routine going. “To make sure any unexpected order delays won’t hurt your ratings, we’re going ahead and temporarily setting your availability status and gig(s) as ‘unavailable’,” it added. The statement clarified that the action by Fiverr would not negatively impact the freelancer’s ratings. In case users were actually not facing any internet issues, the notification directed users to a guide on how to turn their availability back on.         Hussain said he was a doctor and worked part-time as a medical content writer via Fiverr. “I personally knew many friends, juniors, and colleagues who are doctors, but are unemployed and they are using Fiverr to earn their livelihood,” he said. While Fiverr assured freelancers that their ratings were not being impacted, Hussain claimed: “Recent interruption in the internet has badly affected connectivity especially when someone goes offline on Fiverr, it affects impression and less order from buyers. So yeah, it also affected me too.” Aiza Shahid, a student from Islamabad, also told Dawn.com about receiving a notification that stated her “account status is considered ‘unavailable’ due to [her] region”. “This sudden change has left me in a difficult situation, as I rely on Fiverr not just for extra income but for essential financial support,” Shahid lamented. “For the past three years, I’ve been able to use Fiverr without any regional restrictions, so this sudden unavailability was both unexpected and disruptive,” she noted. “The income from Fiverr wasn’t just extra cash; it was essential,” Shahid highlighted, calling the platform her “lifeline” as it was a means to cover her utility bills and education. “The inability to access Fiverr could significantly impact my productivity and my ability to deliver services to clients, which in turn could harm my reputation and future opportunities,” the student said. A Fiverr user from Islamabad stated in a private Facebook group that he received the notification, adding that it was an “automated measure by Fiverr every time there is a countrywide disruption”. “You can easily manually turn it back on in two seconds. Everyone is just making a mountain out of a molehill,” he said. “Fiverr does this so our response rate doesn’t drop if we don’t have the internet to make ourselves unavailable. For them, there won’t be disappointed clients that don’t hear back from potential sellers,” the user explained. On the other hand, Saba Arshad from Faisalabad said she “did not get any such notification” on her Fiverr account. ‘Out-of-office mode’: Fiverr staffer Meanwhile, in response to a user’s query on Fiverr’s community platform, one of the company’s staffers posted a similar statement on Tuesday.     Lena, a Fiverr staffer, said: “We understand that there may be internet disruptions”. “To make sure any unexpected order delays won’t hurt your seller ratings, we set Pakistani sellers into out-of-office mode,” Lena added. “We’ll also make sure that any currently open orders that are unfulfilled won’t affect your ratings. Your account is fully operational and will continue to be,” the Fiverr staffer stated, clarifying that users themselves could revert their status to available. Rights activists lament ‘unstable internet’, WhatsApp disruptions Meanwhile, rights activists have also highlighted reported “slow and unstable” internet access and difficulties in downloading media files on WhatsApp, stressing that it would negatively impact businesses and students who rely heavily on internet access. Farieha Aziz, co-founder of internet advocacy platform BoloBhi, said on X that the “reality is slow and unstable internet”. “Downward spiral,” Aziz said as she criticised “money being poured into network filtering [and] harmful regulation and lawmaking in digital sphere”.     Lawyer Jibran Nasir called on media anchors to dedicate “one show in the spirit of Independence Day to discuss the impact of ongoing internet restrictions of different sectors of society and economy”. Acknowledging that the “dangers of fake news are real and misinformation can be weaponised to instigate acts of violence”, Nasir stressed the need to “rationalise the measures we take for our security concerns”.         Renowned social activist and lawyer Imaan Mazari-Hazir said “documents are not downloading on WhatsApp” as she criticised an advertisement at New York’s Times Square of an IT city by the ruling PML-N.         Ammar Rashid, a public policy researcher and Awami Workers Party member, also assailed the same advertisement: “Just incredible audacity.” “Meanwhile, millions trying to meet deadlines to scrape a living back home can barely download a PDF because the regime’s hobbled the internet to silence criticism,” Rashid said.     Wardah Noor, founder of disaster relief organisation xWave, said she was scheduled to teach 1,500 students from all across Pakistan as she shared an undated screenshot of what she said were messages from a student. “Ma’am, the internet is not working at all here. Only text messages are sent on WhatsApp. Neither any voice note plays nor any link opens,” the message said. “I can’t figure out how to attend the class?” the purported student asked.     In another post on Tuesday, Noor said that “hundreds of our graduates are working with remote companies and earning in dollars to strengthen Pakistani economy but these recent internet outages [and] unannounced social media bans have disappointed us all”. “No quality education can ever be accessible to the masses without the internet,” Noor asserted.

  "description": "LAHORE: Police chase, clashes, arrests and release of PTI workers marked the party’s Independence Day rallies, with PTI Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar emerging on the scene after months. Mr Azhar, who has been mostly in hiding since last year’s May 9 violent protests, briefly emerged in the city before eluding capture by Lahore police. PTI Punjab parliamentarians, led by Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar staged a rally, with the participants marching from the assembly gate to The Mall and up to GPO Chowk and chanting slogans like “Pakistan Zindabad” and demanding the release of PTI founder Imran Khan and other detained leaders.         Despite police efforts to block the rally, participants managed to reach The Mall. As some workers distributed the national and party flags, the police pounced on the workers, arresting more than a dozen of them and tearing the clothes of two workers.  Hammad Azhar resurfaces after months, evades police capture  Mr Bhachar tried to stop police vehicles, but the police sped away with the arrested workers. Later, the opposition leader, along with several PTI MPAs, including Sardar Rashid Tufail, Awais Virk, Ali Imtiaz Warraich, and others, staged a sit-in on The Mall, chanting, Zulm kay zabtay hum nahin maantay (We do not accept the oppression). Speaking on the occasion, Mr Bhachar issued a stern warning to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, criticising the heavy police presence and the aggressive treatment of parliamentarians. “We are celebrating Independence Day, yet we are treated like terrorists,” he remarked, adding that PTI leaders and workers remain steadfast in their support for Imran Khan. Mr Bhachar later told Dawn that all the workers arrested on Independence Day and a day earlier had been released. Hammad Azhar Hammad Azhar led a PTI motorcycle rally in Lahore despite being wanted by the police in connection with over 50 FIRs. The rally, which began at Barkat Market and passed through Firdous Market, M.M. Alam Road, Jail Road, and Ferozepur Road, was dispersed by the police at Kalma Chowk, where around 50 PTI workers were arrested. Mr Azhar, who was on a bike driven by PTI Punjab Information Secretary Shaukat Basra, narrowly escaped capture, protected by a strong contingent of supporters. Mr Azhar was also seen chanting slogans alongside a police prison van. He criticised the government’s heavy-handed tactics and reiterated the party’s commitment to securing “real independence” under the leadership of Imran Khan. He accused the current government of imposing unjust taxes and crippling the economy. Speaking to Dawn, Mr Basra said the police had almost created a curfew-like situation on Lahore’s roads, but PTI leaders and workers were determined to hold the Independence Day rally as announced by Mr Khan. He said the party would also hold a mass public gathering soon. “This TikTok government will collapse when people come out on roads,” he said. Dozen arrested Harappa police arrested 11 political workers and booked 70 others on the eve of Independence Day for bringing out a rally for the immediate release of party founder Imran Khan. The rally was led by Muhammad Yaar Damra, a PTI ticket holder from the PP-201 constituency. Police claimed that more than three dozen political workers and tehsil office-bearers blocked Lakhain Mor and chanted slogans against government and state institutions. Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that Magistrate Arif Niazi had released all seven PTI workers who were arrested and booked by Farid Town Police on Tuesday night for organising rallies in Sahiwal and Chichawatni cities. Resignation Meanwhile, PTI MPA and parliamentary leader in the Punjab Assembly, Hafiz Farhat Abbas, submitted his resignation from his leadership position, stating that his bail applications had been rejected in different cases and he would not be able to lead from the front. In a letter written to PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub, Mr Abbas said he was honoured to be offered the parliamentary party leadership, but he was now unable to do justice with the position. “Until my legal matters are resolved, I cannot do justice with this office,” he said. Mr Abbas requested Mr Ayub to accept his resignation from the office of parliamentary leader and added that he would continue serving as an MPA and party worker.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Capital police spent the day trying to establish the identity and nationality of a foreign national, who was found bound and gagged on a roadside on Wednesday morning. Police officials told Dawn they received information about a woman, who had been abandoned on the roadside in Sector G-6/1-3. When a police team reached the spot, they were faced with a young woman in her mid-20s. She introduced herself as a Belgian citizen and told police she arrived in Islamabad around six months ago. She claimed that she had been living with a man and alleged that he had repeatedly raped her. The woman was taken to hospital for medical assistance, where police attempted to get a statement, but were not able to obtain one. Police also contacted the Belgian embassy, which reportedly had no record of such an individual travelling to Pakistan. They then referred police to the Netherlands mission, since the location she indicated as her native area is near the border between both countries.         Assistance was also sought from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), but they too seem to have no record of a Belgian woman of the given name having travelled to Pakistan. The woman was unable to produce any identification as she had no belongings with her. She then led police to a residence in Sector G-7, claiming it to be the place she had been residing. However, the police said they found nothing there that could help establish her identity and nationality. She also gave investigators the registration number of a vehicle, and police questioned the owner of the car. Police said that a medical examination of the woman is being conducted in the hospital. She is able to speak both English and Urdu and seems to be in good mental health. Dawn reached out to DIG Syed Ali Raza and SP City Arsalan Shahzaib, but neither was available for comment.

  "description": "• Seeks support for govt efforts to make country prosperous; asks youth to focus on skill-based education • Announcement of five-year economic plan rescheduled • Premier warns young people enemy wants to divert their abilities towards ‘anti-state activities’ ISLAMABAD: Extend­­ing Independence Day felicitations to the nation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday promised a “significant cut” in electricity tariffs in next few days. Currently, he noted, electricity bills are the biggest concern of everybody and without reducing the electricity tariffs, Pakistan’s industry, agriculture, and exports could not grow. Addressing a ceremony held in connection with the 78th Independence Day celebrations, PM Shehbaz said, “The government is working day and night to resolve this [inflated bills] issue.” He added that in next few days the government would give the nation a good news of a significant cut in electricity tariffs. PM Shehbaz urged people, especially the youth, to support the government in its efforts to make the country prosperous, stable and peaceful. “The next few years are crucial for you and the country, so only focus on your studies and attaining skilled-based education, and do not indulge yourself in the negative agenda of the enemy who is out to target you and utilise your capabilities in anti-state activities,” he asked the youth. Unfortunately, he said, the enemy was now using digital terrorism tools to sabotage the country’s development journey. The PM paid homage to the immense sacrifices of forefathers and countless unsung heroes of the Pakistan Movement, who fought tirelessly for an independent country for millions in South Asia, where they could live according to their beliefs and values.      As envisioned by Allama Iqbal, Pakistan emerged as an independent and sovereign state on the map of the world on Aug 14, 1947 through the unwavering and steadfast leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and people’s unmatched sacrifices, he added. PM Shehbaz highlighted that although during the past 77 years, the country’s journey had not been exemplary, it was also the fact that it had managed to survive due to the resilience its people showed through natural disasters and economic and social challenges. “We should learn from our past and move forward with renewed pledge and resolve to take the country on the path of prosperity and development,” he added. He pointed out that although people were much worried about inflation, electricity bills, unemployment and other issues, he was very concerned about providing maximum relief to them. He paid tribute to people belonging to various sectors including sports, education, health, etc. He saluted Olympic gold medallist Arshad Nadeem, who attended the ceremony with his mother. The prime minister resolved that in order to fulfil the Quaid’s dream, he would continue hard work for the county’s development. Economic plan PM Shehbaz, who was expected to unveil a comprehensive economic reform plan on Wednesday, rescheduled the announcement of the five-year plan. A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the premier would now announce the plan next week. He said the plan would be based on micro and macro-economic measures to improve local economy, adding that it would contain measures for providing relief to the masses and the business and industry. It will also target local and foreign investors, he added. The premier stated that Pakistan’s industry, agriculture, and exports would be unable to thrive unless electricity tariffs were reduced. PM Shehbaz condemned the ongoing Israeli barbarism on the Palestinians, saying the “massacre of thousands of innocent Palestinians has diminished our pleasures on the occasion of Independence Day”. He also expressed the government’s resolve to stand by the Kashmiri brothers and sisters until the resolution of the issue according to the will of the people of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Earlier, the PM hoisted the national flag during a ceremony held at the Pakistan Monument. He laid a floral wreath at the Pakistan Monument to pay tribute to the country’s founding fathers and national heroes. The ceremony was attended among others by Chairman Senate Yusuf Raza Gilani. Meanwhile, the prime minister thanked his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum for his warm greetings on the Independence Day. “I thank Your Highness and the entire leadership of UAE for always standing with Pakistan in our journey towards peace, progress and prosperity. “I am confident that by working together, we can build a bright future for our peoples. Long live Pakistan-UAE brotherhood,” the prime minister wrote on his official X account in response to the felicitation message by the UAE’s prime minister.         While extending his felicitation to the leadership and people of Pakistan, the UAE premier reiterated his country’s steadfast commitment to strengthening bilateral collaboration, exploring new opportunities for growth, and working together to build a future of prosperity and success.

  "description": "PESHAWAR/QUETTA: A head constable was martyred and a constable suffered injuries when unidentified militants hurled a hand grenade on a check post in Mayar locality of Lower Dir district, while security check posts, a police station, a local hotel and a railway crossing bridge also came under similar attacks in some other districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. After an intense exchange of fire with the militants, security forces and police claimed to have repulsed most of the attacks including those on a check post at Shangla’s tourist spot Yakhtangay, in Jamrud tehsil of Khyber district, a check post and a police station in South Waziristan. Also, armed motorcyclists hurled hand grenades at a hotel and a bridge near Quetta Railway Station, a check post in the Akhtarabad area on the outskirts of the Balochistan capital and in the Gharibabad bypass area of Noshki district. The attacks in areas of Quetta claimed the life of one person and left at least a dozen, including many children, injured. The grenade attacks have intensified in the two provinces in recent weeks, mostly targeting security check posts and police stations.  Cop martyred, another injured in Lower Dir; several gun, grenade attacks repulsed  In Lower Dir, head constable Siasat Khan was martyred and constable Hazrat Nabi sustained injuries when militant hurled a hand grenade at the check post in Mayar locality. However, the attackers fled as soon as police personnel returned fire. The injured constable was later shifted to hospital.      Officials said the martyred police official was a resident of Mayar. He was laid to rest at his ancestral graveyard at Souara Ghundai area after the funeral prayer. A large number of people, including DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi, SP investigations Rashid Khan, political and social activists from across the area attended the funeral as a police contingent presented salute to the martyr. On the occasion, the area elders said that all segments of society should unite to maintain peace in the area. They set a 10-day ultimatum for the arrest of the elements involved in the killing of the police official and warned that if the incident was not fully investigated, they would take a decision. In Khyber district, police claimed to have successfully repulsed two gun and grenade attacks in Jamrud tehsil — on a police post in Sakhi Pul locality and the tehsil compound near a protest camp — on late Tuesday night. Officials said police retaliated with intense firing which forced attackers to retreat with no damage to the check post. Also, the protest camp established by the Kukikhel tribesmen remained safe, as the police firing forced the attackers to flee in the darkness of the night. In Shangla, the police repulsed an attack on a check post at Yakhtangay, a tourist spot. Shangla DPO Imran Khan said militants attacked Yakhtangay police post on Tuesday midnight, but a few police personnel deployed at the check point repulsed the attack, forcing militants to escape from the area. In South Waziristan, a check post and a police station came under attack in the Birmal tehsil on Wednesday. Sources told Dawn the security forces repulsed the attack after an intense exchange of fire with militants. However, locals said, during the attack, a mortar shell hit a house, slightly damaging it. Quetta, Noshki An eight-year-old child was killed and 12 other people, including six children, were injured in two hand grenade attacks at a hotel and a bridge near Quetta Railways station, officials said. “We received 13 injured at the trauma centre and one child who received multiple injuries lost his life,” Dr Wasim Baig, spokesman for the civil hospital told Dawn, adding that the condition of some other injured was also critical. Also, armed men attacked a security post in Akhtarabad area on the outskirts of Quetta. No human loss was reported in the attack. Some motorcyclists threw a grenade at a check post in the Gharibabad bypass area of Noshki. However, no casualty was reported. Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: A patient, who tested positive for Congo virus was admitted to the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital and Research Centre late on Wednesday evening, officials said. The 32-year-old patient, the first Congo fever case of this year, was initially reported at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi on Tuesday from where he was sent to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) earlier in the day. “He is in critical condition. We have shifted him to a specialised hospital meant for infectious diseases where he would receive good care,” explained JPMC’s Deputy Executive Director Dr Yahya Tunio. The patient was a butcher by profession, he added. The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), or Congo fever, is a viral haemorrhagic fever usually transmitted by ticks. It can also be contracted through contact with viraemic animal tissues (animal tissue where the virus has entered the bloodstream) during and immediately after the slaughter of animals. The disease has a case fatality rate of up to 40 per cent. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals. Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2024 "

  "description": "The problem was a desperate one. “We have many non-Muslims … but they are all Pakistanis,” Muhammad Ali Jinnah said soon after freedom. “They will enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizens, and will play their rightful part in the affairs of Pakistan.” What was rightful and what was not, however, became contested at once, as yesterday’s majority now found itself a bewildered minority. Because, whether it was embraced or opposed, Partition brought chaos overnight. “A Muslim comrade in the struggle for Pakistan became a foreigner because he lived in Lucknow,” wrote a British scholar, “while a Hindu Congressman living in Dacca became a loyal fellow-citizen.” For one such citizen, the choice to stay put was a point of principle. “We, the members of the old All-India Congress Party whose lot fell in Pakistan, decided to stay in our homeland because we had fought for independence,” Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya said. “… I told [Congress] that we would not become their sacrificial goats. We shall stay … and show to the world that the Muslims and Hindus can live in the same place, quietly and peacefully … with equal status … as one nation.” Given a state fought and won on the basis of two nations, this was a risky gambit; the horrors of Partition — where more Muslims were massacred than Hindus and Sikhs combined — anything but its disproof. And yet Jinnah rose to the occasion. His pledge to the minorities that they would be safe in Pakistan wasn’t just rhetoric — the dream of a founder with liberal instincts. It was also rooted in reality: that the birth of a country with an overwhelming Muslim majority (86 per cent even at that time) had removed the threat of Hindu domination for good; it was now time to make its minorities whole. With the struggle for self-determination having ended, that of national consolidation could now begin.      Hence his famous speech of August 11, 1947, no less at the inaugural session of Pakistan’s Constituent Assembly. “You are free,” said Jinnah, “you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State.” Perhaps the most repeated words in Pakistan’s history, less remembered is that the Hindu leader of the opposition also spoke with cautious hope. On behalf of what would become the Pakistan National Congress (PNC), Kiran Shankar Roy said that day: “We are unhappy over this division of India … but as this arrangement has been agreed upon by the two great parties, we accept it loyally, and shall work for it loyally. We shall accept the citizenship of Pakistan with all its implications.” A leading Bengali Congressite for two decades, Roy’s speech was met with cheers across the hall. But such goodwill was running out by the end of the session — when Liaquat Ali Khan unveiled the national flag, Congress hawk Dhirendra Nath Datta complained there was little difference between the green-and-white standard and that of the ruling Muslim League. That first debate hence set the tone for a long and bitter exchange between the two parties over seven years, with communal undertones impossible to miss: Liaquat: As a matter of fact, moon and stars are as common to my honourable friend, and they are as much his property as mine. Roy: Would you have the sun also, which is also a common property? Liaquat: The only objection is that the sun’s heat is scorching, and moon’s light is soothing. I do not want our flag to be scorching. I want our flag to give the light that will soothe the nerves. Dhirendra: Sun indicates rapid progress. Liaquat: We have tried to give quite a prominent place to white in this flag which I have presented. More than one-fourth of the flag is white … [which] is made up of seven different colours, and thank God we have not got seven different minorities in Pakistan. Therefore, there is room for not only all the minorities that are today but for any other minorities that might spring up hereafter. Bhim Sen Sachar: I hope you will not create them! Liaquat’s arguments won out — the national flag had to ‘fly in every nook and corner’ of the country just four days later so there was no time for a change. When Dhirendra moved a motion for a bipartisan committee to think up another design, the assembly shot it down. Roy took this in stride. “I just wanted to say that after the verdict of the House,” he addressed the Quaid-i-Azam, “we accept this flag as the flag of the state. We shall pay it proper respect and we shall be loyal to it.” This show of grace was applauded by the rest of the assembly, and a happy Liaquat turned over the flag to the Quaid’s custody. Hardly a year later, Kiran Shankar Roy left the country for West Bengal in India, and died a few months after that. He remains Pakistan’s first leader of the opposition. Bengal disunited Interestingly, it was Roy’s old party, the Indian National Congress, that had authored Bengal’s partition in 1947. Along with British bureaucrats, an entire range of Bengali leaders was set against division (Roy included), with the Muslim League’s Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy wanting “an independent, undivided, and sovereign Bengal, in a divided India, as a separate dominion”. He had also told India’s last viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, that he could sway Jinnah to his cause. But Jinnah was already swayed. When Mountbatten floated the idea of a separate, united Bengal a day later on April 27, 1947, the Quaid didn’t hesitate. “I should be delighted,” he said. “What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had much better remain united and independent; I am sure that they would be on friendly terms with us.” This was also in keeping with the original spirit of the Lahore Resolution in 1940 — that there would be “Independent States” in the plural, “as Muslim Free National Homelands” — again in the plural. No other conclusion can be drawn from the text: the resolution meant three independent, sovereign states with Muslim majorities, as Suhrawardy would propose and Jinnah would second as late as seven years later. But while Suhrawardy pushed and pushed, the Quaid was canny enough to predict his archrivals in Congress would scuttle the Bengal scheme. On June 10, 1947, as Suhrawardy yet again rehashed his case to Jinnah on the lawns of the Imperial in Delhi, the Quaid said, “Go ahead, but the Hindus and Congress will not agree.” He was right — they didn’t. “I am afraid this cry of a sovereign independent Bengal is a trap in which even Kiran Shankar [Roy] may fall …” wrote Vallabhbhai Patel on May 22, 1947. “The only way to save the Hindus of Bengal is to insist on partition of Bengal, and listen to nothing else. That is the only way to the bring the Muslim League in Bengal to its senses.”      Jawaharlal Nehru was equally adamant. “The independence of Bengal really means, in present circumstances, the dominance of the Muslim League in Bengal,” he told the News Chronicle the same month. “It means practically the whole of Bengal going into the Pakistan area, although those interested may not say so. We can agree to Bengal remaining united only if it remains in the [Indian] Union.” Just how much turned on such attitudes can’t be overstated. While citing Nehru’s interview to the Chronicle, Mountbatten shrugged to the cabinet in London that he “was afraid that, in view of this development, the prospects of saving the unity of Bengal and securing its establishment as a third dominion in India had been gravely prejudiced.” It was the tail wagging the dog — after Nehru’s statement to the press, Mountbatten told London, “the only means by which the partition of Bengal could be avoided would be by Mr Jinnah’s abandonment of his claim to the province for Pakistan.” And even if the League foreswore the part of Bengal that had already voted for Pakistan, “the future of Eastern Bengal would present very difficult problems, since it was clearly not a viable unit”. Confronted with this almost comical fait accompli, then British prime minister Clement Attlee’s cabinet committee “agreed that, in the event of the partition of Bengal, Dominion status could not be granted to Eastern Bengal alone; it would have to unite with one or other of the Indian dominions.” With the British Raj having demonstrated the bankruptcy for which it was long known, Gandhi delivered the final blow. “There is no prospect of transfer of power outside the two parts of India,” he told Sarat Bose of the united Bengal camp on June 8. Not least, he wrote, his lieutenants Nehru and Patel were both “dead against the proposal”. The stubbornness of the Congress was explained most frankly by party president JB Kripalani: with independence fast approaching, it was the land grab that took centre-stage. “All that the Congress seeks to do today is to rescue as many areas as possible from the threatened domination of the League and Pakistan,” Kripalani wrote a critic on May 13. “It wants to save as much territory for a Free Indian Union as is possible … it therefore insists upon the division of Bengal and Punjab into areas for Hindustan and Pakistan respectively.” More than aware of this all-or-nothing attitude, the League, too, was leaving itself enough room to tug Bengal into a single Pakistan. Six years after the passage of the Lahore Resolution, the party quietly passed a new ‘Pakistan Resolution’ at its three-day convention in April in Delhi; the text cut the plural of ‘Independent States’ to ‘Independent State’. This shift was protested by the League’s fiery young Bengali leader, Abul Hashim. The original resolution meant two independent Muslim states, Hashim argued, and a mere convention wasn’t competent to change it. According to Hashim, Jinnah dubbed the first draft “an obvious printing mistake”. The Quaid nonetheless allowed that he still didn’t want a single Pakistan encompassing Bengal, and that the original resolution wouldn’t be amended. In any event, Jinnah’s position was consistent with what he would tell Suhrawardy and Mountbatten even after Partition had been conceded: that he supported a united, independent Bengal, just as the plural ‘States’ remained intact in the League constitution. Besides, Jinnah fought to the end for an undivided Punjab and Bengal. “You claim the right of a large minority people to partition on a big scale,” Mountbatten huffed. “If I grant you this, how can I refuse Congress, who will press for exactly the same right for the large Hindu minorities in the Punjab and Bengal to be partitioned?” It’s around this point that court histories mention how Jinnah was forced to accept what he had groused was a “moth-eaten Pakistan”, shorn of Punjab and Bengal’s other halves. This leaves out a fair bit of nuance: Jinnah said on April 30, 1947, that partitioning the provinces was “a sinister move actuated by spite and bitterness”, so as to “unnerve the Muslims by repeatedly emphasising [they] will get a truncated or mutilated or moth-eaten Pakistan.” But, as Jinnah explained, “this clamour is not based on any sound principle, except that the Hindu minorities in the Punjab and Bengal wish to cut up these provinces and cut up their own people into two in these provinces.” For once, Jinnah’s logic was the same as the Bengali writer Nirad C Chaudhuri’s: that such communities were “like Siamese twins, who could not be separated without making them bleed to death” — the cold logic of division taken to a rabid extreme. As for the trope of a moth-eaten Pakistan, the fact remains that Jinnah was going to try for all he could get; the barrister’s flourish one of many for outmanoeuvring stronger enemies. Years after Partition, Nehru’s defence minister Baldev Singh would remember the Quaid waving a matchbox at him for effect: “Even if a Pakistan of this size is offered to me, I will accept it.” Regardless, in the crucial moment when the Bengal assembly voted, it was the Hindu members that brought division home. Per the Mountbatten Plan, a partition of Punjab and Bengal was to be carried out if a majority of any one of the two religious blocs in the provinces concerned accepted it. That majority was found in West Bengal voting 58-21 for partition (all Muslim members voted against). “Never was so much evil owing to so few,” sighed Nirad C. Chaudhuri. The opposite result was returned by the East Bengal assembly, which voted a thumping 103-35 against partition. That the onus lay on the Hindu lawmakers alarmed Chaudhuri: “If our opposition to the partition of Bengal in 1905 by Curzon was right, our demand for it in 1947 could not be so. But just as the British thought that their leaving India was as right in 1947 as their rule was right for two hundred years, the Bengalis thought that both their attitudes were right, each in its time. I had no doubt whatever that they were going to commit suicide.” Doubts or no, what Suhrawardy had warned would be a ‘terrible disaster’ now came to pass. By the grace of the West Bengal assembly, a line was drawn between Dhaka and Calcutta. Not that there weren’t exceptions: as Patel had correctly feared, Kiran Shankar Roy, then the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, abstained from voting for partition. He was rewarded by Calcutta’s Hindu youths setting his house on fire. A Pakistani Congress With the prospect of union having receded, the weight of the Pakistan they had fought so much against was bearing down on the Congress bosses — especially those that now found themselves on the wrong side of the border. These were, in the main, caste Hindus from East Bengal. Up against a fresh ruling class in Karachi, Lahore, and increasingly Rawalpindi, they would describe their dilemma with dark humour; as critics saddled with the wrong politics, the wrong religion, the wrong ethnicity, and the wrong language. But much as they mocked the League, it was their preferred home, the Indian National Congress (INC), that had offloaded them. After all, it was hard to overlook Nehru and Patel’s indifference towards Bengal being cut in half, even as men as different as Roy and Bose and Hashim and Suhrawardy screamed otherwise. To Nirad C. Chaudhuri, part of the reason this division-within-division was welcomed was because “the provinces to which the leading members of the Congress belonged were not to be affected by it. Only Punjab and Bengal, for neither of which they had much fellow-feeling, were to be its victims.” Making matters worse was the INC’s attitude even after the fact. Despite the pleas of its Bengali bigwigs, the mother party refused to allow any offshoot to continue life outside independent India. Faced with apathy on both ends, the East Bengal leaders severed ties with the Indian body and formed a new Pakistan National Congress on August 18, 1948. If a Pakistani Congress sounds like a contradiction in terms, some of its members felt the same way: Dhirendra Nath Datta thought it better to launch a new party with a new name — the Pakistan Gana Samiti — but worries of a split in the Hindu vote meant it acted as a proxy for the PNC, with members like Dhirendra overlapping. So it was that Pakistan’s first opposition party came to be. And though it has been largely erased from public memory since, the PNC remained the League government’s main antagonist for seven long years — a fact more than borne out by the parliamentary debates of the late 1940s and ’50s. Their arena was the first Constituent Assembly, with a membership of 69 at its inauguration — or one member per a million and more citizens. The majority belonged to the Muslim League, at 49 seats; the second largest party, the PNC, at 11, formed the opposition; all had been elected by members of provincial legislatures a month before independence.     The assembly served dual functions: as an ordinary legislature, and as a body tasked with framing a Constitution for the largest Muslim-majority country in the world. While it was expected that party lines would fall away for this high purpose, that wasn’t true of real life. By dint of its numbers, the League’s supermajority meant the debates between members, while often eloquent, weren’t persuasive enough to make the difference. Nor did pushing matters to a vote — the largest haul the opposition could manage during a split was 15 (when three Muslim members broke off). Then there was the uniquely tragic situation of being a Congress for Pakistan. Composed entirely of Hindus, the PNC quickly found the role of minority spokesperson a convenient one. But the true aim of a parliamentary opposition, as the LSE’s Keith Callard noted at the time, was to offer an alternative government for the voter’s approval. Here, the party leaders had been opposed to the idea of Pakistan, and now had to be constantly on alert against allegations of sympathy for a foreign power or, worse, disloyalty to the state — their faith only exacerbating such suspicions. In fairness to the eye-rolling Leaguers, they had just gained a country by the skin of their teeth, and were now witnessing the PNC’s ex-colleagues in India deny Pakistan its assets, mount a brutal occupation in Kashmir, and, in Patel’s case, crow that a military solution would soon yank its errant neighbours back into the fold. There was also no small issue of PNC speeches continuing to hew close to the Indian Congress narrative, with a distaste for what Pakistan represented almost baked in. Yet to read those debates now, it becomes clear that parliament was the scene of pushes, pulls, and polemics far more explicit than today. Though the rise of the internal party meeting was already becoming an accepted problem, there was a pointed exchange of ideas. One in which the PNC was hamstrung from the start. “A true opposition seeks to take the offensive against the government,” Callard writes. “The Pakistan National Congress had to concern itself with the defence of interests that it might yet lose.” Helming the defence was old man Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya, the leader of the opposition. Unlike his predecessor Roy, Chattopadhyaya was near eighty years of age and going nowhere. As a longtime advocate of the Calcutta High Court, he combined forceful oratory with a deep understanding of parliamentary procedure. And in the assembly that came to be known as the Long Parliament, he would lead his small and unhappy band of PNC walas with determination. The Objectives Resolution Nineteen months into its life, prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan introduced the Objectives Resolution to the House on March 7, 1949 as “the main principles on which the Constitution of Pakistan is to be based”. Calling it the most important event since Independence, the prime minister kicked off a marathon debate over five anguished days. The resolution proclaimed the state would work through the people’s chosen representatives and observe democratic principles; that the Muslims would be able to live their lives in accordance with Islam just as minorities could profess their faiths freely; and that Pakistan was to be a federation with autonomous units, fundamental rights, and independent judges. As has been remarked, the resolution was “merely a deposit on account”, to be accepted in good faith: the ulema hoped to enshrine the principle of a state premised on religion, while the politicians found the same principle acceptable so long as it wasn’t clearly defined. But no sooner was the resolution moved by the League that it was scorned by the PNC. “We thought that religion and politics would not be mixed up,” said Chattopadhyaya, concluding later, “ … What I hear in this Resolution [is] not the voice of the great creator of Pakistan.“ What would he tell his people, whom he had been “advising to stick to the land of their birth? … What heart can I have to persuade the people to maintain a stout heart?” His colleague, career revolutionary Bhupendra Kumar Datta, went further, and moved to delete the opening, which read that the sovereignty over the universe belonged to God alone, and that His authority was delegated to the state through its people, if within celestial limits. “We on this side of the House claim to be as good Pakistanis as anybody else,” Bhupendra said. “We have lived in this land for generations unknown, we have loved this land, we have fought and suffered for its liberation from foreign yoke. We shall resent it for generations that … you condemned us forever to an inferior status.” Professor Raj Kumar Chakraverty, more restrained than the jail-going, hunger-striking Bhupendra, wanted a subtler change: that God’s authority, as “delegated to the state”, be swapped for “delegated to the people”. As Chakraverty saw it, the wording allowed the state to wield power in any way it liked, when “a state is the mouthpiece of the people and not its master.”      One after the other, the PNC’s amendments failed. And when Speaker Tamizuddin Khan opened the floor, the League’s leading lights hit back: the resolution was defended by freedom activist Abdur Rab Nishtar, professors Mahmud Husain and Ishtiaq Qureshi, and international lawyer Zafrulla Khan. To the charge that the Quaid would have disapproved, Nishtar responded, “Pakistan was demanded with a particular ideology, for a particular purpose,” and the resolution was in keeping with Jinnah’s pledges “to the majority as well as to the minority. We have done nothing and none of us dare to do anything which goes against the declarations of Quaid-i-Azam.” It nonetheless became clear there were varied interpretations of the resolution within the same party: while Liaquat assured the House he sought “a truly liberal government”, Zafrulla spoke of the prohibition of usury, drinking, and gambling. To think politics was mutually exclusive from religion, claimed Zafrulla, was to take too narrow a view of religion. (As one observer noted, such views couldn’t protect the member from being dubbed a heretic two years later.) Others stuck to safeguards. While pointing out the Islamic clauses only related to the Muslim majority, Mahmud Husain focused on restraining the leviathan; he cited a range of European thinkers had divorced morality from politics, in service of a sovereign gone wild. But “the state of our dreams shall not be sovereign without any limits,” he said. Would the religious right agree? “How many of these learned gentlemen understood the much-abused term ‘sovereignty’ in the familiar classroom sense of deputy minister Mahmud Husain, PhD?” writes American political scientist Leonard Binder. “Erudite references to the sins of Bodin and the excesses of Machiavelli did not stir them at all.” Such condescension missed the point: just because the rightists didn’t agree, didn’t mean they didn’t understand; the resolution could mean something rather different in their hands. This most piercing critique came from Chattopadhyaya: “What are those limits, who will interpret them?” he asked. “Dr [Ishtiaq] Qureshi or my respected Maulana Shabbir Ahmed Usmani?” At the time at least, the ulema were nowhere at the fore of the resolution. “There is no strong evidence to show that the leaders of the Muslim League had in mind anything but modern democratic nationalism,” notes Binder. If so, it would have been even more democratic had the majority accommodated the opposition’s less radical changes in the spirit of bonhomie, rather than dismissing each one. A divide that stark also meant the debates of 1949 have since take on the status of a grand opera; a fight for the soul of the country. In truth, the Objectives Resolution was a compromise document for a complicated project: the world’s first Islamic republic, one that could neither become a secular tent nor a theocracy of divines. Along the way, it seems to have accomplished something democratic: condemned by liberals and mangled by conservatives (General Zia’s anti-minority edit was reversed in 2010), it remains the only tract that has formed the preamble of all three of Pakistan’s constitutions. And it has also evolved along with them: Raj Kumar Chakraverty’s amendment, fiercely contested at the time, was accepted by the framers of the current Constitution. As the preamble now stands, God’s authority is ‘exercised by the people of Pakistan’ and not the state. This would be referenced several decades later by the Supreme Court’s Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja striking down military courts in his dissenting opinion in District Bar Association, Rawalpindi v. Federation: “Though Professor Chakraverty was unsuccessful in 1949, our Constitution makers in 1972-73, who were fully aware of the divisive debates of 1949, accepted what had been proposed … as a fundamental Constitutional principle.” It had only taken them three coups and a quarter of a century. As for Chattopadhyaya, his speech would lend itself to the title of a Dawn essay by the paper’s greatest columnist, Ardeshir Cowasjee, on May 2, 2010, called ‘Not the voice of the creator’. “Jinnah’s Pakistan has virtually ceased to exist,” wrote Cowasjee the month of the Eighteenth Amendment’s passage, “but there are still some who hope it has not yet been interred forever.” Degrees of difference Things didn’t get any easier for the PNC in the House, as the terms of their exclusion were nuanced by some of the brightest minds in the country. When the party protested that non-Muslims be allowed to become president, this was waved away by law minister A K Brohi. “He [the president] is only there for naam ke wastay,” said Brohi, like the powerless king of England, and incidentally, wasn’t the king required to be Anglican? Besides, a non-Muslim could still be prime minister, just not the ribbon-cutting, party-throwing head of state. “I do not think any of my friends on the opposite [side] would like to lead a retired life like that,” said Brohi. Chattopadhyaya’s rebuttal — that unlike the British monarch, the president of Pakistan was elected (he also wasn’t the head of a church that mandated his confession) — was never entertained. Even more disruptive was the question of voter rolls: together or apart? Jinnah’s own famously complicated relationship with separate electorates — a battle between his ideals and his electors — illustrated the dilemma well. Or, as one critic sneered in 1946, “Pakistan is only the lengthened shadow of separate electorates.” The importance of such electorates was rooted in anxiety: that the Muslim elector would be swallowed up by a one-man, one-vote system in undivided India. After independence, however, the majorities had become minorities, with the League in the chair. Having fought so long for special status, the ruling party was more than happy to pass on the favour to its own minorities in Pakistan. But just as the League’s ideas hadn’t changed, neither had those of the PNC, which went right on demanding joint electorates — in an alternative universe where the numbers stood reversed. “In my dictionary, there is no such word as “majority” or “minority”,” said Chattopadhyaya. “I do not consider myself a member of the minority community … I consider myself as one of the 7 crores of Pakistanis. I do not want any special rights. I do not want any privileges. I do not want reservation of seats in the Legislature. I say frame the same laws for me which affect everything equally.” While this was doubtless the ideal arrangement, it was a bit removed from the situation on the ground. In the words of Sindh’s hardnosed political boss, Ayub Khuhro, without reserved seats, “not a single Hindu will be returned to the Assembly”. (Long depressed, Professor Chakraverty replied, “We want to go out of existence; that will do good to the country.”) But the PNC kept pressing their claim, and with reason: under separate electorates, Hindu politicians could cater only to all-Hindu electorates, limiting themselves to drab communal campaigns. That also meant closing the door on national politics, as well as yet another special category — Scheduled Castes — dividing the Hindu vote. “This party is treated with contempt,” Dhirendra Nath Datta said, “and it deserves that because, sir, we have not got the potentiality of being converted into a majority party unless there is one common electorate.” But two years later, as Callard points out, when the East Bengal elections of 1954 had confirmed the popular mandate of many of the Hindu leaders, a final attempt was made to convince the majority. Standing by himself in the House, his PNC allies having snubbed the Constitution-making process, Dhirendra told the treasury benches, “We want to be united with you. We want that there should be one electoral roll for both the Hindus and the Muslims.” When translated into winning votes for Hindu lawmakers in 1954, Dhirendra’s logic left a mark on another, newer party in East Bengal — as the Awami League threw its doors open for non-Muslim members. And yet, fearful of any move that would heal Bengali divisions, the status quo suited Pakistan’s other half just fine. Social collapse would follow. ‘They are only boys.’ At the core of the problem lay the question of autonomy: if there was one quest that consumed the Constituent Assembly more than any other, it was that of a federal solution. Because Pakistan had been born a ‘double country’, two wings separated by over a thousand miles of hostile Indian territory, with yawning differences in politics, geography, ethnicity, and economy. But the first spark was language. “The State language … should be the language which is used by the majority of the people,” Dhirendra moved as early as February 25, 1948. Liaquat promptly accused him of creating “a rift between the people of Pakistan”.      And yet Karachi’s case against Bengali, like how it was too coloured by Sanskrit, scarcely passed muster — especially given the sisterhood between Urdu and Hindi. “Bengali was not a Hindu language at all,” Chattopadhyaya told the House. “… All our books, as you know we were the custodians of our books as Brahmins, were written in Sanskrit — not one word in Bengali.” By 1952, the high politics of the assembly had devolved into bloody student agitations in the street — at the end of the broken curfew on February 21, four Bengalis lay dead from police fire. “They are only boys,” said Chattopadhyaya. “… Who agitated our own boys? Students of colleges! I know how to stop them.” Nurul Amin, the conservative Leaguer from East Bengal, had little patience for this; the PNC was fanning the same flames it was weeping over: “They will provoke them and tell them to go on creating chaos in the country because that suits their purpose,” he said. But beyond this ritual exchange, the riots had completely transformed the push for Bengali autonomy, in a way the assembly — on both sides — couldn’t quite understand at the time. From the days of the Raj, Pakistan had inherited weak national parties and strong provincial outfits: slowly but surely, a new ‘vernacular elite’ elbowed past much of the old guard from Dhaka, and demanded that East Bengal’s majority be acknowledged. Hence the rise of the Awami League, a party of small-town lawyers and students in a hurry. Before the year was out, it had triumphed not only in the provincial polls but also on the Bengali issue. Though it chided a succession of leaders from Jinnah to Liaquat to Nazimuddin for sticking to Urdu, the matter was nonetheless settled by 1954 — when the assembly’s draft Constitution enshrined Bengali as a national language. But the riots had not only taken a toll on Pakistan as a federal project, they had also irreversibly demonstrated one of Bengal’s most powerful political traditions: the strength of the student.      Purge As could have been predicted, the fight for autonomy soon graduated from a brawl between political parties to an all-out east-west struggle within the heart of government. Brewing since the death of Jinnah, whose paramountcy meant such tensions were kept at bay, Liaquat Ali Khan’s unsolved murder tipped the fight into the open. Though an oversimplification by everyone from local reporters to British diplomats, it was the Punjab group and the Bengal group that drew battle lines. “Liaquat had managed to keep the major antagonists in relative balance,” writes Lawrence Ziring, “but in matters judged to be of vital importance, he was more likely to favour the Fazlur Rahman group.” Not to be confused with the shrewd maulana, Dhaka’s Fazlur Rahman was a key cabinet member, arrayed against finance wizard Ghulam Muhammad steering the Punjab faction. Liaquat had admitted his “highest priority” was sacking the latter, a bureaucrat given to paranoia and rage. Before he could act, however, Pakistan’s first prime minister had fallen to an assassin’s bullet. From the beginning, the Bengalis couldn’t shake the fear that Liaquat had been killed because he leaned towards the east; they also dealt in dark whispers about Ghulam Muhammad’s possible involvement. Kicking him up to the ceremonial office of governor-general, while bringing in Nazimuddin as prime minister, was thought the solution; it would prove the opposite. “Throughout the first quarter of 1953, the governor-general made several unsuccessful attempts to persuade the Prime Minister to reconstitute the cabinet,” writes scholar Yunus Samad. “He wanted a surgical action which would remove Fazlur Rahman, Nishtar, Mahmud Husain and Sattar Pirzada from the cabinet and leave the pliable Nazimuddin in place …” Given these were also the ministers “most difficult for Ghulam Muhammad to control”, per author Allen McGrath, it would be a mistake to think the governor-general was motivated by visions far grander than personal power at the assembly’s expense. Nor was the fight purely ethnic in nature: as another writer has noted, the Bengal group had non-Bengali ideologues (Abdur Rab Nishtar and Mahmud Husain), and the Punjab Group had non-Punjabi soldiers (Ayub Khan and Iskander Mirza). The former sought its strength from a parliamentary majority; the latter from an increasingly powerful nexus between generals and bureaucrats. That was, as always, the principal contradiction, though British cables do much to caricature the former as elected conservatives, and the latter as liberal technocrats. In fact, the two factions clashed across the board: in matters foreign, Ghulam Muhammad and Ayub were more than eager to commit themselves to the Americans and their military pacts. While suspicious of the Soviets, the Nazimuddin ministry wasn’t quite as enthused about Uncle Sam. On the domestic front, the growing confidence of the Bengali majority was upsetting to the Punjab, just as the stridently non-Bengali civil service saw the government as weak and vacillating. Over the next several weeks, as spring set in and anti-Ahmadi riots engulfed Lahore, Ghulam Muhammad’s men took their chance. The contrast between a responsibility to the public — however distant — and the joys of unelected force, was brought out by Iskander Mirza’s recently published memoirs recounting the episode on a single day in March. As Nazimuddin was being persuaded to surrender to the rioters by a prime enabler himself, Punjab’s chief minister, Mumtaz Daultana, Mirza put in a call to major-general Azam Khan in Lahore. “I take all responsibility,” Mirza told Azam. “… Declare martial law, take action, and finish the thing off.” “Sir, there will be casualties,” said Azam. “I expect casualties,” the author cheerfully reveals. “Or you will not be doing your duty.” As the soldiers rushed to take Lahore from the sectarians, the major-general’s updates began grating on Mirza: “Azam Khan started to send me telegrams — with a copy to the prime minister — stating: “X number mullahs shot today.” At this, the prime minister went off the deep end. He called me and moaned, “Colonel, I cannot sleep.’” Mirza’s solution to this surreal problem was to have Azam amend his letters to “So many bad characters shot.” After that, Mirza writes obliviously, “[Azam] used this formula, and everyone was happy, except perhaps the mullahs. And this was how we were running the country.” Scarcely more material is required to understand the thinking of this most early of deep states. “The governor-general used to send for me and say: ‘How can we run the country with this prime minister?’ admits Mirza. “I used to keep quiet. What could I say?” The ‘we’ — Ghulam Muhammad, Mirza, and Ayub — all strong personalities (the latter two with zero votes to their name), was illustrative. And with law and order returning to Lahore (“Damn good show,” Ayub congratulated Azam), Ghulam Muhammad launched Pakistan’s first successful coup. What Mirza described as a “fight to the finish” between conservatives and liberals — buffeted by Ayub urging a change in government if the army’s confidence was to be maintained — meant a major purge.      Not that it had any legs: the riots had been quelled, the budget had just been passed, and Nazimuddin had refused the rioters’ core demand — that foreign minister Zafrulla step down. Most of all, he enjoyed the support of the majority in the assembly. It’s also why the cabinet’s Bengal group defied Ghulam Muhammad’s orders to resign, rightly claiming the parliament’s confidence. As expected, the ministers who were purged along with Bengalis Nazimuddin and Fazlur Rahman were the same deemed most problematic by the unelected: Nishtar, Sattar Pirzada, and Mahmud Husain, “replaced by three figures with little political strength.” This was thrown in sharp relief when the governor-general reappointed half of Nazimuddin’s cabinet — including the embattled Zafrulla. The true arrival, of course, was that of the soldiers in the palace. The governor-general “could never have dared to dismiss a ministry which had appointed him, had he not have had the support of the army,” Suhrawardy wrote that week. Per their own cables, the coup seems to have been met with satisfaction by British officials. As Nazimuddin desperately tried to call the Queen and have her governor-general reverse himself, London held that a sacked prime minister “has from time of dismissal no right of access to the Queen, who could only be advised by Ministers in Office”. Not that it ever got that far: Nazimuddin’s phone line had been cut. Eclipse Though claimed otherwise at the time, the illegal removal of Pakistan’s second prime minister was not without consequences. As even the British High Commissioner cabled to his superiors, “Khwaja Nazimuddin was an East Bengali and East Bengal’s leading political figure. He had now been brusquely and possibly unconstitutionally, dismissed, and without consultation with political leaders in East Pakistan.” And though the newly installed premier, Muhammad Ali Bogra, shared Nazimuddin’s ethnicity, feelings in the East had begun to boil over. Less than a year later, the Awami League’s United Front alliance swept the provincial elections. Comprising Suhrawardy, Fazlul Huq, and peasant leader Maulana Bhashani — with derision for the Muslim League the main factor in common — the Front had campaigned on a platform of Twenty-One Points. Easy to see now as the Six Points in embryo, the manifesto vowed the regional autonomy promised in the Lahore Resolution. The result was a thrashing for the Muslim League. ‘Sher-e-Bangla’ Fazlul Huq was elected chief minister, but the lion’s roars to the press — invoking the province’s ‘independence’ — alarmed Karachi. Nor did soaring violence help: taken together, the coalition barely lasted six weeks in office. In yet another first, the west resorted to direct intervention in the east on May 29, 1954 — the Front was sacked and emergency rule imposed under Iskander Mirza with Bogra calling Fazlul Huq a ‘self-confessed traitor’ for good measure. As Bengali leaders fell one after the other, the east’s serial humiliations had started to overwhelm the entire country. In one extraordinary session of the Constituent Assembly on July 17, the PNC even made common cause with the Muslim League’s Mahmud Husain — late of Nazimuddin’s ruptured cabinet — in slamming emergency rule. “The paradox in East Bengal is that on the one hand we call ourselves a democratic state … but a province which consists of the majority of its population has been denied the democratic right to govern itself,” Husain said. And in more places than one: “If one went to the East Bengal Secretariat, one was surprised not to find a single Bengali Secretary in the whole of the Secretariat,” whereas the west’s civil servants “are hardly on meeting terms with any of the Bengali officers”, and that hatred and suspicion began seeping in as soon as Partition. Faced with a member of Mahmud Husain’s nationalist credentials, an ex-chief whip no less, taking aim at the centre’s neglect, Bogra’s allies attempted to mitigate their embarrassment. But when the deputy speaker headed off Mahmud Husain mid-speech, support came from unlikely quarters: Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya: I can give five minutes from my own time. He should be allowed to continue. Bhupendra Kumar Datta: He is speaking the truth. (Interruptions by several members) Bogra: The Honourable Leader of the Opposition has let the cat out of the bag. Shri Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya: Yes, he has exposed you thoroughly by naked truth. Members from Opposition benches: He is speaking the truth. He is speaking the naked truth. … Shri Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya: …I tell my friend Dr Mahmud Husain that of all the Muslim members of the Muslim League party who spoke here, he has said the truth and reality which others had not the courage of doing … Mr President! Sir, I stand here not for the purpose of vindicating Fazlul Huq’s ministry … but I stand here to vindicate the rights, the valuable rights, of the people of East Bengal. I stand here to vindicate democracy. Bogra was unfazed — he blamed much of the problem on communism and his speech received flattering Cold War-era coverage in the New York Times. But along with shifts in the assembly, 1954 marked a turning point. “The Punjabi leadership … was quick to realise the implications of the fundamental change brought about in the polity by the defeat of the Muslim League in East [Bengal], and the unanimous vote in favour of provincial autonomy,” writes Hasan Zaheer in The Separation of East Pakistan. “The solid bloc of Bengalis in the parliament could easily woo the smaller provinces and thus dominate the Punjab.”      Bogra was in the midst of this slow realisation, even as the assembly’s dissidents were planning a shock of their own. The League rebels (a broad church led by Fazlur Rahman and shepherded by speaker Tamizuddin, along with Nazimuddin, Mahmud Husain, and, ironically, AK Brohi were able to marshal enough numbers for a majority and, on 21 September, passed the Fifth Amendment — stripping the governor-general of his powers via a lightning raft of bills. As Callard writes, the thesis was simple: ‘The arbitrary action of the governor-general in dismissing the Nazimuddin ministry had been neither forgiven nor forgotten.’ The ‘rebel tactics’ had four aims: to repeal PRODA (the not-so-venerable grandfather of the NAB Ordinance) and prevent the governor-general from prosecuting the assembly’s members; to deprive the governor-general of his powers; to bring in a no-confidence button; and to restrict future governments solely to members of the assembly, ensuring the cabinet’s dependence on the legislature. It wouldn’t have been premature to say this was a political settlement in the offing: that at last, the assembly could be sovereign; at last, a federal structure could be agreed upon; and at long last, a draft Constitution of 1954 had been approved and was making its way to the printers, to go into effect on the Quaid’s birthday on December 25. Of course, Ayub prevailed, and another coup followed on October 24, 1954: the draft Constitution was stillborn, the assembly dissolved, and the Long Parliament breathed its last. Ghulam Muhammad’s new ‘cabinet of talents’ — with defence to Ayub and the interior to Mirza — set the stage for the Constitution of 1956, one that went much further in empowering the president, under-representing the Bengalis, and earning the outright rejection of the Awami League. A month later, Fazlur Rahman was confined to East Bengal, by order of the government under the Security of Pakistan Act. He was subsequently disqualified from politics by Ayub’s EBDO law, the successor to PRODA. Prospect To the critics, the story of the first Constituent Assembly is a story of decline — its members too lazy and too divisive to have been up to the task of framing a country’s Constitution. It’s a diagnosis that lets the real culprits off too easy, per Dawn from three years later, “There have indeed been times — such as that October night in 1954 — when, with a general to the right of him and a general to the left of him, a half-mad governor-general imposed upon a captured prime minister the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and the virtual setting up of a semi-dictatorial executive.” Even still, while the Long Parliament did take its sweet time, the draft Constitution of ’54 had no small number of achievements: it accepted Bengali as a national language; afforded the east its numerical majority in the House; allowed for a Senate as part of a bicameral system; tried the flawed but workable Bogra formula as a means to pull along both wings in federal fashion; left the window open for a prime minister from a minority faith; declawed the governor-general in favour of the prime minister and parliament; and dismissed the idea of One Unit out of hand.      Few of these proposals came naturally, and almost all merited more debate. Yet it bears repeating that the October coup set off a horror house of events for East Bengal — from delayed polls to One Unit to another takeover in 1958: with the assemblies sacked all over again, political parties (including the long-suffering PNC) banned, and a dictatorship of the army declared. When general elections did resume, the much-persecuted Suhrawardy was gone; his place taken by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a violent provincial that harbored none of the pretensions to all-Pakistan leadership his late mentor had. Meanwhile, Ayub handed East Bengal to Nurul Amin’s cruel and reckless protégé, Monem Khan. Unlike his predecessor Azam (whose career took him from martial law in Lahore to a popular stint at the Governor House in in Dhaka), Monem arrested journalists, rigged elections, and even banned Tagore — he would also taunt Fatima Jinnah’s supporters for not having nominated an East Pakistani as their presidential candidate. The breakup that ensued is beyond the scope of this piece, but half a century is long enough for today’s scholarship to take alonger view than just the sins of three men: Yahya, Bhutto, and Mujib. The conservative take — that Indira Gandhi’s scheming and Mujib’s treachery came together to overwhelm Pakistan, by then a helpless victim of the maniac Bhutto and depraved Yahya — ends with friendly foreign powers abandoning the country at the crucial moment. The liberal approach is more thoughtful, if not thoughtful enough: the gross theft of the Awami League’s mandate, the postponement of the Dhaka assembly, General Tikka unleashing war crimes on a civilian population from March 25 onward, the failure to find any political solution in the interim, and the abandonment of the Polish resolution at the United Nations. In fact, the threads that unraveled that December went all the way back to the promise of the country’s creation. Given what we see today — from Balochistan to the former tribal areas, and from Azad Jammu and Kashmir to Gilgit-Baltistan — it is high time Pakistanis honour the federation that remains, as well as each one of the minorities that continue to call it home.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) has issued a flood alert for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, forecasting heavy rains in the province from August 14 to 18. According to the NDMA, various regions, including Hazara, Mala­kand Division, Peshawar, Bannu, D.I. Khan, Hangu, Haripur, and Kohat, are expected to receive significant rainfall during this period. Also, rainfall is anticipated in the areas of Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Mohmand, Orakzai, and Waziristan. The NDMA has warned of the potential for flooding and an increase in water flow in rivers and streams due to the heavy rains. Authorities have been advised to take precautionary measures to mitigate the effects of possible floods and landslides and to ensure the availability of resources for any emergency situation.      Tourists have been cautioned to avoid travelling to mountainous areas during this period due to the risk of landslides. The authority also advised relevant departments to remain vigilant and prepared for potential flooding, besides asking all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and landslides. “Rain may cause urban flooding in various cities and flash flooding in hilly areas, while flow of water in the streams and nullahs is also expected to increase,” the NDMA said. The NDMA issued ins­tructions to all relevant departments to alert em­ergency response teams and mobilised resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. In a statement, the NDMA advised local administrations to remain on high alert and to coordinate closely with relevant departments to respond promptly to any emergency. The authority also emphasised the importance of maintaining clear communication channels to provide timely updates and warnings to the public. Local authorities are being instructed to monitor the situation closely and to take necessary steps to ensure the safety of residents and tourists alike. This includes deploying rescue teams, reinforcing embankments, and ensuring the availability of essential supplies and equipment. The NDMA’s flood alert comes as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities in the face of extreme weather events. The authority has been working closely with provincial and district administrations to develop comprehensive contingency plans and to strengthen coordination mechanisms for effective disaster management. As the forecasted period of heavy rains approaches, the NDMA is urging communities in vulnerable areas to stay informed about weather updates and to follow the guidance of local authorities. By taking proactive measures and adhering to safety guidelines, residents can help minimize the risks associated with flooding and other natural hazards. The NDMA advised people to download Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile app for timely alerts and closely monitor weather reports. Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Urges unity to elevate Pakistan to the level envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam, Allama Iqbal • Inaugurates 21 Nadra centres, six mobile registration vehicles in Balochistan QUETTA: As the nation grapples with the scourge of terrorism and militant attacks with alarming frequency, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar has declared that there is no room for violence in the country, and the notion of disgruntled individuals holds no significance. “Pakistan will emerge as the fortress of Islamic nations, where every individual can live a peaceful and prosperous life,” he said while addressing a flag-hoisting ceremony at the Balochistan Assem­bly’s lawn on Wednesday. Senator Ishaq Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, urged the nation to come together in unity to elevate Pakistan to the level envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal. “The people of this country have a great spirit, but unfortunately, just when Pakistan was making progress, it was dragged down,” he observed.         He claimed that Pakistan had become the world’s 24th largest economy in 2017, gaining global recognition, adding that Pakistan’s stock exchange had become the number one in South Asia and the fifth globally. “Pakistan is a country blessed by Allah with countless resources. People talk about Pakistan having a debt of $130 billion, but I say that Allah has endowed Pakistan with over $10 trillion worth of minerals,” he added. He said Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had initiated the process to make Pakistan a nuclear power, and Allah granted Nawaz Sharif the honour of realising that dream. “Now, Pakistan needs to become an economic power alongside its nuclear status,” he said, adding: “For this, we need unity and cohesion to achieve what Allah has destined for us.” Endorsing the statement of the chief minister, Mr Dar acknowledged that Balochistan was left behind in development, and now “we must work for its progress”. Recalling the vision of the incumbent government, he vowed to continue Pakis­tan’s journey towards inclusion in the G20. The flag-hoisting ceremony was attended by National Assembly Speak­­er Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, federal Minister for Trade and Commerce Jam Kamal Khan Alyani, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, provincial ministers, MPAs and civil and military leadership. They also participated in a grand ceremony held at Bugti Stadium in Quetta on Tuesday night to mark the 78th Independence Day. The Independence Day was celebrated with great enthusiasm across Balochistan, including the provincial capital, with a renewed vow to transform Pakistan into a developed, prosperous, and economically and politically stable nation on the global stage. The government and private organisations held national flag hoisting ceremonies in Quetta and other cities and towns across the province, including the Quaid-i-Azam Residency in Ziarat, which drew large crowds of people from all walks of life. Nadra registration centres The deputy prime minister, who arrived in Quetta the other day, also inaugurated 21 new Nadra registration centres and six mobile registration vehicles in Balochistan at a ceremony held at the CM Secretariat. He directed the federal institutions to fully cooperate with the provincial government in providing services to the remote areas of Balochistan. On the occasion, CM Sarfraz Bugti expressed the hope that the establishment of new registration centers in 21 tehsils would facilitate the public in getting registration and obtaining identity cards in remote areas of the province. The deputy PM also met PML-N parliamentarians at the Governor House. Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2024 "

  "content": "As netizens across Pakistan decry hindered access to internet, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) has linked it to increased security and surveillance whose aftermath might result in severe economic consequences as well. Commenting on the issue on Thursday, WISPAP Chairman Shahzad Arshad said: \"It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers [...] Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality anymore. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan.\" The Arshad statement comes as the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government and the country's top cyber regulator the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) have remained quiet as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The internet disruption is not only affecting citizens' rights but also causing financial losses to the national exchequer, as several online businesses, including e-commerce and ride-hailing services, are bearing the brunt of the restricted connectivity. Users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. The issue has been being attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media and is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Speaking on the issue during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', Farieha Aziz — co-founder of Bolo Bhi, an organisation working for digital rights — called out the government for maintaining ambiguity around the issue and highlighted the economic impact of internet slowdown. Commenting on the matter, she recalled how the government initially had denied suspension of X and had termed it as a technical glitch only to admit later that it had knowingly restricted the platform. \"Finally there is some acknowledgement about internet firewall,\" Aziz said. \"Maybe we'll get to know something [...] but something is cooking for sure,\" she added, referring to an in-camera meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom that is due today. Meanwhile, Nighat Dad — a lawyer and digital rights activist — also censured PM Shehbaz's administration for the prevailing obscurity around the issue during her appearance in 'Geo Pakistan'. Dada underlined how misinformation and fake news thrive in ambiguity and that the government was encouraging such behaviour where speculations are being made as people have been left in the dark. \"Who can you question if there's no accountability,\" she noted while adding that the prevailing issues were not technical glitches of social media and communications platforms. The experts' remarks come as internet disruption is not only affecting citizens' rights but also causing financial losses to the national exchequer, as several online businesses, including e-commerce and ride-hailing services, are bearing the brunt of the restricted connectivity. Users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. The internet restrictions and slowdown are being attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media and is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Last month, a report by The News had termed the then internet slowdown to a \"trial run of the firewall\" by the authorities. Lamenting the adverse effects of internet restrictions and slowdown, the Karachi-based activist noted that people's businesses and day-to-day communications on WhatsApp have also been affected leaving them unable to download media files on mobile data coupled with hampered WiFi speed. \"We still don't know what [technology] is being tested and to what extent [....] It seems that what is being done is that the internet traffic is being slowed down by creating bottlenecks,\" she added while noting that something was being done with \"network filtering for sure\". Touching upon the economic aftermath of internet-related issues, Aziz called out the incumbent government for talking about IT parks and digital Pakistan and said: \"Who is paying for all these expensive advertisements? Who will invest in Pakistan in such a situation when even Fiverr has termed the country as not being business-friendly saying that freelancers won't be able to deliver [on projects].\" Several people have lost their clients and the international market is viewing Pakistan as not being a viable digital market option for business, she said while stressing the need for the quantification of the economic repercussions. Echoing Aziz's views, Dad also noted that the country's gig economy relied heavily on internet and social media platforms, which are then used by the people and communities [for businesses] who don't have access to larger markets. \"If you [government] continue to do this in such a crippling economic situation, then 'Digital Pakistan ka Allah hi hafiz' (only God can save Digital Pakistan),\" she said while criticising the Centre for failure to hold an open dialogue on the issue and instead resorting to assumptions-based on unilateral decisions. The activist also highlighted that the government's security issues-related narrative over internet restrictions needs to be elaborated upon as to what specific concerns are there and from whom, which internal and external forces are involved in it. The internet firewall in question provisions filters that will block unwanted content from reaching the masses and will be used to inspect information originating from different internet protocol addresses. Last month, an official told The News that the measure would identify the locations from where the propaganda material originated and would then block or diminish the coverage of those accounts. There will be a keyword filtering system to detect content the government considers undesirable or prejudicial to national security etc. In such cases, the filter will act like an information inspector. These kinds of posts will likely be camouflaged and will subsequently be made invisible to outside users. Posts from all dissenting voices in and out of the country are likely to pass through this inspection before they are allowed to be made properly visible. This filter will run its check on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter). Preparation is also in progress to prevent the ‘misuse’ of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as the government can declare it mandatory for citizens to inform the PTA about the VPNs they are using. Anyone failing to do that could land in trouble."

  "content": "India's 78th Independence Day is being observed as \"Black Day\" by residents of the occupied Jammu and Kashmir valley, Kashmiris in Pakistan as well as those around the world, condemning New Delhi's illegal occupation of their homeland.  Leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), incarcerated in India's infamous Tihar Jail, have called for Kashmiris to convey a strong message to India, repudiating its illegal occupation and demanding their right to self-determination.  The Kashmiri leaders urged the world's powerful nations to pressurise India to grant Kashmiris their basic right to self-determination. They reiterated the Kashmiri people's resolve to take ongoing plebiscite demand to its logical conclusion. \"India has no legal or ethical right to celebrate its freedom in the occupied Kashmir. India’s occupation of Kashmir is a clear violation of the UN resolutions and international laws,\" they said. On the other hand, Indian authorities have tightened restrictions across the Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on eve of India's Independence Day. Meanwhile, Kashmiri refugees held a demonstration against India at the Azadi Chowk in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Anti-India rallies followed by protest demonstrations in all small and major cities and towns on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC), will be the hallmark of the day. “Participants of the protest rallies will wear black bands around their arms as a sign of hatred against India,” the organisers of the special black day programmes had said earlier."

  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Thursday said the city will witness cloudy skies, drizzle and light rain in the next 24 hours after experiencing light rain early in the morning today. According to the Met Office, the city's minimum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 28°C, while the maximum temperature is likely to reach 30°C to 32°C. As per PMD's forecast, the winds in the city are blowing at a speed of 13 kilometres per hour with 85% humidity and there's a possibility of light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta and Badin. The Met Office also expects rainfall to hit various parts of the country including Islamabad, with the possibility of downpour in some places. According to Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz, monsoon winds are set to enter lower Sindh from August 16, and under the influence of these winds, there is a possibility of rain in Karachi during August 17 to 19. He said that \"mostly moderate rain with thundershowers\" is expected in Karachi and \"there may be heavy rain at some areas\". A day earlier, in light of the monsoon spell, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warned of urban flooding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa till August 18 due to heavy rains which are expected to hit various parts of the province. Anticipating further rains, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the NDMA said that moderate to heavy rains are expected in Hazara, Malakand Division, Peshawar, Bannu, DI Khan, Hangu, Haripur, Kohat, Kurram, Lucky Marwat, Mohmand, Orakzai and Waziristan areas. The development comes after the recent rains resulted in as many as 178 fatalities, including 92 children, across the country since July with the collapse of homes being the biggest cause of death."

  "content": "KARACHI: After an extended summer break, all private and public schools in Sindh will resume educational activities from Thursday. The provincial government had last month extended summer break for educational institutions till August 14. Earlier, the summer vacations that commenced from June 1 were to end on July 31. In a statement, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah advised students to focus more on their education. He also urged the teachers to fulfil their responsibilities honestly, adding that merit-based recruitment of teachers improved the education system. “For the first time in the country, Sindh introduces teachers licence policy and other reforms,” the minister added. Last year, the Sindh government introduced a teaching licence policy to promote skilled professionals. The minister had said that the provincial government was taking \"revolutionary steps\" for reforms in the field of education, adding that the teaching licence policy would set new standards for educational excellence. It is pertinent to mention here that the Sindh School Education and Literacy Department approved recommendations to start the new academic year in the primary and secondary educational institutions in August this year. As per notification issued by the provincial department in February, the new academic year 2024-25 will begin on August 1, 2024, instead of April 1, 2024. The provincial education department had earlier decided in November last year to start the new academic year in the public and private schools on April 15, 2024."

  "description": "Three retired military personnel were taken into military custody in connection with court martial proceedings against former spymaster Faiz Hameed for his alleged involvement in victimising the owner of a private housing society, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Thursday. According to the statement, three retired officers were under military custody for “actions prejudicial to military discipline”.      “In connection with the FGCM proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing.” The ISPR has neither revealed the names and ranks of the three retired officers nor disclosed when they were taken into custody. In an unprecedented step, the army on Monday announ­ced Gen Hameed’s arrest, the previous head of the premier Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, on allegations of violating the Army Act. According to a source, Gen Hameed was taken into custody from Rawalpindi when he was summoned for a meeting by a senior military official. The move, prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society, shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence. The army cited a Nove­m­ber 2023 directive from the Supreme Court of Pak­i­s­tan, which instructed Ka­n­­war Moeez Khan, own­er of Islamabad’s Top City housing society, to seek redressal of grievances against Gen Hameed thro­ugh relevant channels, including the Ministry of Defence, as the basis for initiating action against the former spymaster. More wider arrests to come: information minister Information Minister Attaullah Tarar later addressed the developments, saying an institution had prioritised self-accountability and kicked off an investigation in that vein. “We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.” Tarar said every institution should be self-accountable, adding that it was very good that the military had initiated the process. He said today’s ISPR statement “proved that the three officers were arrested as a result of the investigation from Gen Hameed”. The minister further said that the most important part of today’s ISPR statement was that “on the direction of one political party and its leader, the words used [in the statement] are ‘behest’ and ‘collusion’ with Gen Hameed due to which discord and instability were being spread in the country, it was being destabilised and there were attempts to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were attacks on security. “So this collusion and the conspiracies that are being concocted on the direction and will of the PTI founder, I think it was a very good and timely decision [of the military]” to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers. Tarar alleged that Gen Hameed and his allies were also in touch with former prime minister Imran Khan at the time of the no-confidence motion against him “and were fully busy in political wrangling”. The minister said that no one could be permitted to create instability and chaos in the country or compromise its security. “It seems that further arrests will be brought into effect and its ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country’s security … all those will come in its grasp.” Tarar claimed that Imran was also sending messages from jail and was now attempting to distance himself from the arrest. “But you cannot distance from it, it is clear as day that the direction and wish of the PTI founder were involved when Gen Hameed did all these actions and there was a communication and link due to which these matters were conducted but the PTI founder was leading it.” The minister said further evidence and names were coming to light after the investigation of the arrested officers. He said there was “glaring and irrefutable evidence” present on whose basis the arrests were conducted. Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon similarly said the arrests were “welcomed the way important decisions are being taken for Pakistan’s security and the noose is tightening against all those people who whether they were involved in May 9 or conspiracies against institutions or those who crossed every limit to malign institutions and did not care for the country’s security just for the greed for power and their positions in collusion with a political party and the PTI founder”. Memon said the recent arrests proved that “PTI leadership and some enablers were involved” in digital terrorism, campaigns against institutions and attempts to spread discord. The case against Gen Hameed The military had reportedly formed an inquiry committee in April to investigate allegations of misuse of authority against the former head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Media reports had said the committee was formed by the military as a gesture of self-accountability and would be headed by a serving major general. They had said the committee was formed in the light of directives of the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Defence. In its written order issued on November 14, the apex court had said that allegations of an “extremely serious nature” against ex-spymaster retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed “cannot be left unattended” as they would undermine the reputation of the country’s institutions if they were proven to be true. The written order had said: “The allegations are of an extremely serious nature, and if true, undoubtedly would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI, and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.” The management of Top City, a private housing scheme, had levelled grave allegations against the former ISI chief, claiming that he had orchestrated a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. In November 2023, the Supreme Court had asked the owner of the housing society to approach the relevant quarters, including the defence ministry, for the redressal of his grievances against the former spymaster and his aides. The newly constituted inquiry committee will prepare its report in the light of its findings and present it to the relevant authorities, the reports had said. In March 2023, then-interior minister Rana Sanaullah said that a probe was underway against the ex-ISI boss and his brother over alleged corruption and accumulating assets beyond means. In March 2024, a Rawalpindi court had sent retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, brother of the former spymaster, to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand. Najaf, along with co-accused persons, had sought pre-arrest bail in the FIR registered with the Anti-Corruption Esta­b­l­i­shment (ACE) in Rawalpindi. The FIR had alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir acquired properties worth billions of rupees in the name of benamidars. Retirement and controversial past Gen Hameed had opted to seek early retirement and sent his resignation to the high command in November 2022, according to unnamed sources. He was made the ISI chief in June 2019. He was the eye of the storm in an alleged standoff between the military and the PTI government over the appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the new chief of the ISI in the last quarter of 2021. The army had announced on October 6, 2021, that Gen Hameed was appointed the Peshawar corps commander, while Lt Gen Anjum was appointed in his place. But the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had not issued an official notification of Lt Gen Anjum’s appointment until three weeks later, leading to frenzied speculation of strains in civil-military relations. After delays, the PMO had eventually notified the appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the new ISI chief on Oct 26, 2021. Imran had later said he never wanted to “bring his own army chief” and that he “never meddled” in Pakistan Army’s affairs. Gen Hameed was among the six senior-most generals whose name was included by General Headquarters in the list of potential candidates for the two top military offices, sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for approval in November 2022. Before assuming charge as Bahawalpur corps commander, Gen Hameed had worked in the same position in Peshawar. The former spymaster has been the subject of many controversies in the country’s political landscape for the past decade. Gen Hameed’s name first caught the public eye when he helped end the Faizabad dharna by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan in November 2017 through an agreement. In a suo motu notice of the incident, the Supreme Court in February 2019 had ruled that the ISI, the Intelligence Bureau, Military Intelligence, and the Inter-Services Public Relations “must not exceed their respective mandates”. He had been the target of strong criticism from PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz for allegedly having a role in their convictions and for backing the previous set-up under PTI. In July 2018, former Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had made serious allegations against personnel of a security agency, claiming that they were manipulating judicial proceedings. He also claimed the agencies approached the IHC chief justice to ensure Nawaz and Maryam remained behind bars for the elections. The judge was subsequently sacked. However, in December 2023, he had named several retired army generals, as well as some former judges, as parties in the case against his removal. Senior counsel Hamid Khan, on behalf of the ex-judge, had moved an amended application before the Supreme Court to name as respondents in his petition former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, Gen Hameed, three retired brigadiers — Irfan Ramay, Faisal Marwat and Tahir Wafai — as well as a former chief justice of the IHC, Anwar Khan Kasi, and a former registrar of the Supreme Court, Arbab Muhammad Arif. Gen Hameed rejected the allegations of his involvement in the constitution of the IHC benches to prolong the detention of Nawaz and Maryam in his response to the petition, claiming that the judge had dragged him into the case for no reason. Furthermore, then-human rights minister Riaz Pirzada claimed in February 2023 that Gen Hameed wanted to bring the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) back to the country. In May 2023, former federal minister Faisal Vawda accused Gen Hameed of being the “architect, mastermind, and biggest beneficiary” of the Al-Qadir Trust case. The case alleges that former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd for legalising Rs50 billion, which was later identified and returned to the country by the UK during the tenure of the PTI government. Petition As per the petition, on May 12, 2017, the Pakistan Rangers and officials of the ISI raided the office of Top City and Moeez’s residence and took away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case. The petition further stated that Gen Hameed’s brother Sardar Najaf mediated and tried to resolve the issue. After his acquittal, the petition claimed, Gen Hameed contacted Moeez through the latter’s cousin — a brigadier in the army — to arrange a meeting. The petition claimed that during the meeting, Gen Hameed told the petitioner that he would return some of the items taken away during the raid except for 400 tola gold and cash. The petition claimed that retired brigadier Naeem Fakhar and retired brigadier Ghaffar of the ISI allegedly “forced” the petitioner to “pay 4 crores in cash” and “sponsor a private AAP TV network for a few months”. As per the petition, former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir were also “involved in the illegal takeover of the housing society”. "

  "description": "Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said on Thursday that the government had ordered the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other relevant bodies to submit a report after citizens in various cities of Pakistan claimed they had been facing internet connectivity issues. Her statement comes a day after the business community and the internet service providers alleged that the government’s heightened efforts to monitor internet traffic had resulted in a significant nationwide slowdown of services, leading to losses. The Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (Wispap) said internet speeds over the past few weeks plummeted by 30 to 40 per cent and warned that the situation had become so dire that many businesses were considering relocating their operations to other countries. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Khawaja said that the government had requested a report from PTA and other relevant institutions related to the disruption of the internet. “The relevant authorities, including PTA, have been asked to inform us about the impact on data traffic in the last two weeks,” she said. “Internet should never be slow, we have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt that, and conversations about higher [internet] speed are underway.” The minister added that the government setting up a firewall had been blown out of proportion, adding that it was a routine exercise across the globe to enhance internet security.            View this post on Instagram              “There was a web-management system being operated by the government before too, which is now being upgraded,” she said. “It is the right of the government to [take such measures] given the cyber security attacks that this country has to go through.”      Major online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been hit hard since last week with users reporting slowdowns and difficulties in accessing messaging and social media applications. Some users have speculated that the disruptions were the result of a firewall being installed by the government to monitor and keep check on users. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had denied that the issue was caused by a firewall and said it had not received any complaints related to internet disruptions yet. Dawn.com has separately reached out to the PTA but is yet to receive a response. Reported outages According to Downdetector, an internet outage tracking website, the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) was the most affected while services provided by Zong, Nayatel, and Fiberlink were also affected. Dawn.com staffers also experienced data outages on Ufone — a subsidiary of PTCL — and Jazz. Downdetector showed a sharp spike in reported outages of PTCL services from around 12:30pm onwards. Most of the outages were reported from Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Islamabad, and Multan, among other cities.    This screengrab, taken at around 1:40pm on August 15, shows reported outages of PTCL’s internet services in the last 24 hours. — Downdetector  Within the same timeframe, more than 35 outages were reported by Zong users while over 30 such complaints were made by Nayatel users.    This screengrab, taken at around 1:50pm on August 15, shows reported outages of Zong’s internet services in the last 24 hours. — Downdetector    This screengrab, taken at around 1:50pm on August 15, shows reported outages of Nayatel’s internet services in the last 24 hours. — Downdetector  Meanwhile, Meta platforms Facebook and WhatsApp also witnessed a sharp spike in outage complaints at around 1pm, Downdetector showed. Both platforms have also seen a higher-than-usual number of outages in the past 24 hours. Senate body wants issue resolved within 2 weeks Meanwhile, the Senate’s standing committee on IT ordered the tech ministry to resolve the issue of internet disruptions and access to social media apps within two weeks. During the committee’s session today, presided over by PPP Senator Palwasha Khan, members from both the treasury and opposition benches raised concerns about the issues. PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand highlighted that the issues were negatively impacting businesses in Pakistan. PML-N’s Afnanullah Khan claimed that the cyber slowdown had caused the country a loss of at least Rs500 million. Responding to the concerns, IT Secretary Aisha Humera Chaudhary said there was a “disruption in services of mobile operators”. “It can be a technical issue that will soon be solved,” she said. Subsequently, the committee directed the IT ministry to solve the issue of internet and social media platforms’ connectivity within two weeks. It also sought a report on the losses caused by these issues. "

  "description": "PTI leader Hammad Azhar on Thursday stepped down yet again as the president of the party’s Punjab chapter citing a lack of access to incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan. Azhar had previously stepped down as the general secretary and acting president of the party’s Punjab chapter in March citing his legal tribulations and the obstacles they presented in performing his duties. However, the party had refused to accept the resignation from his offices and urged him to continue performing his duties. He emerged on the scene after months and led a PTI motorcycle rally in Lahore on Wednesday despite being wanted by the police in connection with over 50 cases. In a post on social media platform X today, Azhar elaborated on the issues that led to the decision. “Unfortunately I don’t have access to Imran Khan. I did not hold a press conference nor did any deal as my movement is very restricted and I cannot go to Adiala. Many such decisions were taken in the organisation of Punjab which neither included my opinion nor my consent. Most of these decisions were based on lobbying and limited access to Imran Khan and one-sided information instead of merit.” He claimed that “lobbying was underway since quite a while to replace PTI Lahore President Chaudhry Asghar and the effort had now succeeded.” Azhar praised Asghar for his performance in the past three months and for leading the party from the front. “But his opponents began filling Khan sahib’s ears since the week after he was nominated as President. The party leadership also agrees with me that this decision and many such decisions are taken only as a result of limited access to Khan sahib. “Apart from this, there are many other cases where there was clear injustice, wrong decisions were made and in some regions, our leaders are very worried but Khan sahib is not even informed,” he added. Azhar said it was not possible for him to violate merit during his presidency and denotify those people rendering services to the party only because they could not access Imran. “I had already resigned for the same reason that it is not possible for anyone to run the affairs without access to the party chairman. In such cases, vested interests take advantage of this lack of communication. Major organisational responsibility should be vested only in those who have access to the party leader to convey the full message to the party chairman. Lahaza I am leaving the charge of the Punjab Presidency from today. I was a worker of Imran Khan and will remain so.“         In a separate post, he said: “I am not interested in the party position nor was I before and before too I took this responsibility on your urging. I will continue to work for the party but without any position. I believe that in the current situation, this is the right path for me.” Azhar also claimed that there were issues related to groups and communication in the party. “Since I do not have contact with Khan sahib, I would like to deliver some messages to him. I am using social media out of necessity because sending messages is the root cause of real issues at this time.” Azhar said there were three groups in the party with different interests and thoughts. “Get them all on one page and no one should be allowed to have a different strategy than your thinking. Anyone who has a different opinion than you should not even be allowed to go screen.” He further claimed that two other groups in the party were bringing messages from different camps. “These people have become overly important and give you specific feedback about their favourites in the party and get you to utter statements of their liking,” Azhar added. The PTI leader said the solution was simple and Imran should meet Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, as much as possible. He praised the two as “responsible and mature people and because of them the party persevered through a hard time but they don’t meet you as much as they should”. Azhar said the issues were not so major that they could not be fixed, adding that access to Imran was being abused and it needed to be fixed otherwise it could be damaging.         "

  "description": "Seven terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday. According to a press release issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was conducted on the reported presence of terrorists in the area. It said security forces effectively engaged terrorists of the Fitna Al Khawarij, formerly called the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and seven were killed while five were injured. “Khwarij’s hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition & explosives was recovered,” the ISPR said, adding that the slain terrorists were involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces as well as innocent civilians. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other kharji (outcasts) found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the statement added. President Asif Ali Zardari appreciated the professionalism shown by the security forces for the successful operation and paid tribute to them. According to a press release from the President House’s media wing, Zardari reiterated the national commitment to eliminate terrorism from the country. “The entire nation is with the security forces for the total eradication of terrorism,” the president said.         Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also commended the efforts and said that the entire country paid tribute to the officers who engaged in “performing their duties without caring for their lives for the integrity of Pakistan”. According to a post on state-run PTV’s X account, the premier stated that the forces were working “day and night to cleanse” the country of Fitnah Al Khawarij. “The entire nation stands by the side of the Pakistan Army in its determination to cleanse the soil of the homeland from the menace of terrorism,” Shehbaz said. Last week, an officer embraced martyrdom during an exchange of fire in the Tirah Valley’s Bagh area of Khyber district. Similarly, two soldiers and five civilians were martyred in a terrorist attack on a rural health centre in the Dera Ismail Khan district in July. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. According to an annual security report issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies, Pakistan witnessed 1,524 violence-related fatalities and 1,463 injuries from 789 terror attacks and counter-terror operations in 2023 — marking a record six-year high. KP and Balochistan were the primary centres of violence, accounting for over 90 per cent of all fatalities and 84pc of attacks, including incidents of terrorism and security forces operations.

  "description": "Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb on Thursday questioned how the government was planning to attract foreign investment amid the continuing phenomenon of missing persons in the country. The judge issued the remarks during a hearing related to the recovery of missing PTI worker Malik Faizan. Two days ago, the IHC had also summoned the interior and defence secretaries, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) director general, and the Islamabad inspector general of police (IG) on a petition seeking the recovery of PTI activist Azhar Mishwani’s two brothers. Zahoor and Mazhar were allegedly picked up by law enforcement agencies in June, with Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi ordering the Punjab IG to recover the two brothers. The PTI has also launched a campaign on social media for the recovery of “abducted” workers and activists, including the party’s international media coordinator Ahmad Waqas Janjua. The campaign aims to draw the attention of the courts to the disappearances.         Justice Aurangzeb heard the petition for Faizan’s recovery today. “The world is also watching what Pakistani courts are doing in cases of missing persons,” Justice Aurangzeb said. “Or either admit that the world come and invests here but people will still go missing and the courts will not be able to do anything.” He continued: “If the government calls it a case of enforced disappearance, then they need to find out who ordered it. The government then needs to sit down with the abductors.” When the judge asked who the missing workers were, the petitioner’s lawyer mentioned Faizan, who works for the PTI’s media cell. Addressing the additional attorney general, Justice Aurangzeb — in a harsh tone — suggested that he “change the Constitution, remove fundamental rights from it, end our (the court’s) jurisdiction”. “I don’t know what the state wants to achieve with this. You arrest him (Faizan) and we won’t say anything, but the country cannot run like this,” the judge said. “The Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior, and the state are all content with this, but I don’t understand what is going on. What do you aim to achieve with this?” Justice Aurangzeb asked. The judge also remarked that earlier, the bench which heard the case wrote that it was a matter of enforced disappearance. Calling it a “cruel act”, he wondered what the constitutional courts should do in such a situation. “The federal government means the prime minister and the federal cabinet, so the responsibility ultimately rests with the executive,” Justice Aurangzeb remarked. The additional attorney general said that the petitioners “did not knock on the door of the court with clean hands”. In response, Justice Aurangzeb remarked: “Should the petition be dismissed if they did not file the petition with clean hands?” “Do you want me to become a servile judge?” he asked. “Should I reject ‘dirty’ applications from ‘dirty’ applicants? I don’t understand where you are going with this,” Aurangzeb said, asking the prosecutor, “Tell me, what I should do?” The AAG replied: “We do not know who the kidnappers are.” Justice Aurangzeb further remarked, “When one of our fellow judges issued a strict order, the government propaganda machines started propaganda against him.” He added that he would pass a written order in the case and adjourned the hearing. Govt announces ‘support package’ for families of missing persons Earlier in August, the government announced a Rs5 million “support package” per family of missing persons, which would provide them with legal and financial assistance. Addressing a press briefing in Islamabad, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar said that a report, based on the findings of two previous cabinet committees, had been presented to the cabinet committee for missing persons during the caretaker government’s tenure. He added that the report was presented before the federal cabinet and some of its salient recommendations had been approved. “A special committee will be formed to determine which families need an immediate support package, after which each [eligible] family will receive Rs5 million,” Tarar said. “Keep in mind that this is not a compensation of any kind, as there is no compensation for a human life,” the law minister clarified, adding that the package was being given as a “support” to such families considering their “hardships until the matter is resolved”.

  "description": "The Pakistan Army last week announced that it had taken the former director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, into custody, making him the first ex-spymaster to face a court martial. According to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lt Gen Hameed’s court-martial had been initiated in connection with a private housing scheme scandal. It added today that three other army officials had also been taken into custody in relation to the case against Gen Hameed. The management of Top City, the private housing scheme in question, had levelled grave allegations against the former ISI chief, claiming that he had orchestrated a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan, and had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case. While the news dominated the headlines, this was not the first time the army held one of its officers accountable for wrongdoing. Here is a list of some high-profile army officials whose accountability caught public attention. NLC scam — Lt Gen (retired) Khalid Munir Khan, Lt Gen (retired) M. Afzal Muzaffar In 2009, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) initiated an inquiry after the National Logistics Cell (NLC) reported that it suffered a loss of Rs1.8 billion between 2004 and 2008. The loss was incurred as a result of loans from commercial banks being given at high interest rates and investing Rs.4bn of pensioners’ money in stock markets. Additionally, kickbacks were received from companies through which the money was invested. The inquiry by the Planning Commission carried out under orders from PAC revealed that there were financial irregularities, lack of transparency, and failure to observe rules and regulations caused by reckless decisions of the chain of command at NLC. The inquiry pointed to the involvement of former quartermasters Lt Gen (retd) Khalid Munir Khan and Lt Gen (retd) M. Afzal Muzaffar, former NLC director general (retd) Maj Gen Khalid Zaheer Akhtar, and two civilians — Najibur Rehman and Saeedur Rehman. A quartermaster general, by virtue of the office, is the officer in charge of the NLC. In light of the findings of the investigation committee, the then army chief,  Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, decided to proceed against the accused under the Pakistan Army Act’s Section 94 instead of referring the matter to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). An Army Court of Inquiry was convened in November 2010, and preliminary findings were reported to the army chief in February 2011. Subsequently, a formal investigation was ordered by Kayani to allow a fair trial. In 2015, the investigation concluded, revealing that two retired general officers and one civilian officer were responsible for making improper investment decisions in violation of NLC rules and regulations. The two generals were punished under the Army Act. Khalid Zaheer was “dismissed from service” while Afzal Muzaffar was penalised with “severe displeasure (recordable)”. Espionage — Lt Gen (retired) Javed Iqbal Lt Gen (retd) Javed Iqbal was convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM), on May 30, 2019, of “espionage/leakage of sensitive information to foreign agencies prejudicial to the national security”. In May 2021, the 14-year sentence was commuted by the appellate authority for seven years. Later, former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa further reduced the sentence by another two and a half years just before his departure from the GHQ. The jailed general was, therefore, scheduled to be freed on May 29 last year, but the new Army Chief Gen Asim Munir finished the sentence completely, paving the way for his early release. Attempted coup — Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi and others Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi, Brig Mustansir Billah, Col Mohammad Azad Minhas, Col Inayat Ullah Khan, and 38 other military officers were arrested on September 26, 1995, on charges of plotting to storm a corps commanders’ meeting, to be held on Sept 30 at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. The alleged plan included the assassination of then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the then-army chief Gen Waheed Kakar, senior cabinet ministers, and military chiefs, to be followed by the proclamation of the Islamic system of Khilafat with Maj Gen Abbasi as Ameerul Momineen. The details of the conspiracy were revealed after Qari Saifullah Akhtar, one of the conspirators and chief of his breakaway faction called Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islami, turned an approver. On his witness, the FGCM awarded seven years of imprisonment to retired Maj Gen Abbasi, when a large cache of arms and military uniforms were confiscated. The FGCM also awarded a 14-year jail term to Brig Mustansir Billa for his alleged involvement in the attempted coup. Col Minhas and Col Khan were court-martialled in Sept 1996 for their alleged role in the conspiracy by the FGCM and sentenced to four years each in prison by a military court. Mutiny and terror links — Brigadier (retired) Ali Khan In 2011, Brig Ali Khan was arrested on charges of having links with banned outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir. Along with Maj Inayat Aziz, Maj Iftikhar, Maj Sohail Akbar, and Maj Jawad Baseer, the four accused were convicted in the case. The FGCM awarded a sentence of five years of Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) to Brig Ali Khan. Maj Sohail Akbar was awarded three years RI while Maj Jawad Baseer was sentenced to two years RI, whereas Maj Inayat Aziz and Maj Iftikhar were awarded one year and six months of RI each. Brig Khan was also accused of being involved in conspiring to topple the government, trying to instigate a mutiny within the army, and planning an attack on the GHQ. He was released in 2016, after serving his five-year term. During the seven-month-long proceedings, five military officers recorded their testimonies from the prosecutor’s side. The officers had claimed that the accused, Brig Khan, provoked them to mutiny against the civil leadership. Removed from service There have also been instances when general officers instead of being brought in for a court-martial were removed administratively after disciplinary proceedings. Gen (retd) Ziauddin Butt, made army chief in October 1999 by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was kept in custody for two years. In a conversation with Dawn, Butt said that he was given a hand-written order that he was removed under Section 16 of the Pakistan Military Law and Manual of Pakistan Military Law but was never court-martialled. In 2016, in one of the biggest corruption purges in the military, six army officers including two serving generals —  Lt Gen Obaidullah Khattak, inspector-general arms, and Maj Gen Ejaz Shahid — were sacked during the tenure of Gen Raheel Sharif. In 2015, the general officers involved in the NLC scam were also removed from service after disciplinary proceedings. Not court-martialled despite SC orders While there are great examples of how the army has held its officials responsible for wrongdoing and taken action against them, there have been instances when the institution failed to do so despite receiving orders from the apex court. In 1996, Asghar Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC, accusing the ISI of doling out Rs140m to a group of politicians in the 1990s.  Among the accused were former army chief Aslam Beg and former director general of the ISI Lt Gen (retd) Asad Durrani. Durrani confirmed the allegations in an affidavit to the apex court. In it, he admitted his role in the affair, named the other players, and elaborated on how the scheme unfolded. Following that, in a landmark judgement on Oct 19, 2012, the SC  asked the defence ministry to initiate necessary action against the officials for their role in dishing out the money. By 2019, according to a report submitted by the defence ministry to the SC during the hearing of a plea by Asghar Khan’s family for implementation of the judgement, the defence ministry had constituted a court of inquiry, which had recorded the statements of six witnesses and was looking for more witnesses. Another ‘court of inquiry’ to investigate Durrani was set up in 2018. The court of inquiry was made to look into the book ‘The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI, and the Illusion of Peace’ and determine if its content and Durrani’s involvement with the book was culpable. Three years later, while opposing Durrani’s request for the removal of his name from the no-fly list, the Ministry of Defence accused him of being involved in anti-state activities, alleging that he was either “affiliated or interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW [Research and Analysis Wing], since 2008”, in a report submitted before the Islamabad High Court (IHC). However the IHC removed Durrani’s name off the Exit Control List (ECL), with the judge remarking that “according to the record, there was no inquiry underway at the time.” "

  "content": "Security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a statement issued by the military's media wing said on Thursday. \"On August 15, 2024, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Kurram district on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. \"During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the Khwarij's location, as a result of which, seven Khwarij of Fitna Al Khawarij were sent to hell, while five of them got injured.\" The statement further said that the terrorists' hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered. The killed militants remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces as well as innocent civilians, it added. The sanitisation operation was launched to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country, the ISPR said. Earlier this week, four soldiers were martyred while six terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between the miscreants and the security forces in South Waziristan, a statement issued by the military's media wing said late Tuesday night. “On night 12/ 13 August 2024, fire exchange took place between the security forces and Khwarij in South Waziristan District.” Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.  According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) stalwart Hammad Azhar has once again tendered his resignation from the post of party's Punjab chapter president, citing \"lack of access to Imran Khan\" and restrictions on his movements as the reasons behind his decision. The politician, who had also served as a federal minister during the PTI regime, remains in hiding amid fears of arrest as he is booked in several cases related to May 9 mayhem. \"Unfortunately I do not have access to Imran Khan. I did not hold a press conference nor did any deal as my movement is very restricted and I cannot go to Adiala [jail],\" Azhar wrote on X.  The Imran Khan's loyalist expressed various grievances, one of them was not consulting him in the decisions taken within the PTI's Punjab organisation, as he said \"most of these decisions were based on lobbying\" instead of merit. Moreover, he said limited access and provision of one-sided information to the PTI founder also concerned him.  Azhar cited Chaudhry Asghar's removal as PTI's Lahore president as one example of \"lobbying\", saying that the lobbyists wanted to replace Asghar and they succeeded today and got the desired directives from the jailed PTI founder by giving him the \"wrong facts\". The former federal minister said that the \"opponents\" of the deposed prime minister started misleading him against Asghar after his nomination as Lahore president, despite the latter's services for the party.  He stressed that the PTI leadership also \"agreed\" with him that the Asghar's removal and many such decisions were a result of \"limited access to Khan sahab\".  The former federal minister also mentioned that Khan was not being informed about the troubles of PTI members in various other regions.  \"In this situation, it is not possible for me or during my presidency of Punjab to violate the merit and denotify the people who are performing and making sacrifices just because their voices cannot reach Khan sahab,\" he said.  The PTI leader recalled the first time he had resigned \"for the same reason that it is not possible for anyone to run the affairs without access to the party leaders\".  He further stated that those who have vested interests take advantage of the lack of communication with PTI founder. Azhar said that the major organisational responsibility should be vested only in those who have access to the party leader to convey complete facts to him.  \"Therefore, I am leaving the charge of the Punjab Presidency from today. I was a worker of Imran Khan and will remain so God willing,\" he concluded.  It may be noted that the PTI leader had stepped down from the posts of acting PTI Punjab president and general-secretary earlier in March, saying that the \"party would be best served by leadership present on ground\".  In response to Azhar's announcement of resignation, Asghar and PTI Lahore's Secretary-General Hafiz Zeeshan Rasheed also tendered their resignations.  \"I'm grateful to the workers for their support in our struggle for the release of PTI founder. I hope the upcoming Lahore president would be a better choice than me,\" he said.  "

  "content": "LONDON: Former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar has contradicted social media reports stating that his absence from the country may be linked to the arrest of General (retd) Faiz Hamid, the former chief of Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency who faces court martial following his arrest for alleged misconduct in a case related to a private housing scheme. Speaking to this reporter over the phone, Nisar confirmed that he was in London. He said: “I am here to meet my friends and family. I will be visiting Scotland, and Norway and then back to Pakistan in the first week of September. It's unfortunate how fake news is being spread against me. I am praying for the sanity of those who malign and target people just for the sake of it.” Social media news claimed the former CJP had fled to London and that he could be arrested in the wider inquiry related to the arrest of the retired general but the former CJP rejected such speculations. He said there was no truth in what has been claimed by some people in the media and social media. Two days ago, the military said Gen Faiz had been arrested because there were “multiple instances of violation” of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. “The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,” it added. The military said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company’s owner. On Thursday, the military said three more retired officers were taken into military custody in connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of General (retd) Faiz. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that the retired officers were arrested for their actions prejudicial to military discipline. “Further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing,” it also said. The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, sources said adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster. The two former brigadiers, accused of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said. The government has hinted at more arrests in the coming days."

  "content": "The Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology has sought swift resolution of the internet and social media disruptions across the country while directing relevant authorities to resolve the ongoing issues within two weeks.  The directives came after the committee's members raised the issue of internet and social media applications being affected across the country. In a meeting, presided by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Palwasha Khan, officials of the IT ministry and Pakistan Telecommunications Authority were also present. During the meeting today, committee members decried the loss of IT infrastructure-dependent businesses, particularly e-commerce firms. \"Internet slowdown has cost at least Rs500 million... Many e-commerce forums are leaving,\" said Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Afnan Ullah Khan. He also complained about the issue of uploading and downloading on WhatsApp and social media platforms. Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) said the slowdown of internet and social media apps is affecting business. \"You have destroyed people's jobs. Without investment, this method will destroy the entire business,\" he said, addressing the authorities. Responding to the concerns raised in the meeting, IT Ministry Secretary Aisha Humera Chaudhry said that the service of mobile operators has been disrupted, attributing it to a likely \"technical issue\" which she added will be \"resolved soon\" \"It is a problem on networks and not on Wi-Fi,\" she said. The PTA official, on the other hand, denied receiving \"any complaint\" regarding internet service. The Senate body also sought a report on the losses incurred in the wake of the problem. Meanwhile, the committee's agenda on the discussion around the firewall issue was postponed due to the non-availability of PTA officials. The authority was scheduled to present details regarding the firewall before the standing committee that had called for an in-camera briefing regarding the matter. Earlier today, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) blamed the issue on increased security and surveillance whose adverse repercussions, they added, might lead to severe economic repercussions. In a statement issued today, WISPAP chairman Shahzad Arshad revealed that internet speeds witnessed around 30% to 40% reduction which has had a devastating effect on businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity. The issue has been raised as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The issue has been attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience."

  "content": "Distancing himself from the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) founder Imran Khan has said the arrest of the retired general is an internal matter of the Pakistan Army.  The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on August 12 announced the arrest of the former ISI chief, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said earlier this week. \"I have no connection with General (retd) Faiz,\" the incarcerated PTI leader said on Thursday while talking to journalists at Adiala Jail. \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter. Welcoming the development, the former premier said it was good that army has launched the process of internal accountability, he noted. However, he urged the military to ensure that the process of accountability should be across the board. Responding to a question relating to his past engagement with the former spymaster, the 72-year-old cricketer-turned-politician said that while he was the premier he did not want to remove General Faiz from his office amid regime change in Afghanistan.  At the time, General Faiz was engaged with the Afghanistan government and Taliban, the PTI founder said, adding that the former army officer arranged his meeting with then US envoy on Afghanistan’s peace process Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives. The former ISI chief continued negotiations with the Taliban for three years as he enjoyed good relations with them, he noted, adding that the former serviceman was an asset for the country however, he was wasted.  The embattled PTI founder said that he exchanged heated words with the former army chief, General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa over the issue of removing the former ISI boss from his post, adding Bajwa removed Faiz for the sake of his extension. \"I repeatedly asked Bajwa not to remove Faiz but to no avail,\" he added. \"General (retd) Bajwa also toppled my government for the sake of his extension,\" he stressed, adding that he holds Bajwa responsible for the spike in terrorism in the country. Commenting on a statement by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif who had said the former spymaster was involved in the May 9 riots, Khan demanded an inquiry into to ascertain if the retired general was behind the violent protests. \"Khawaja Asif said that General Bajwa had sought extension. It is the endorsement of what I have been saying,\" he continued.  He also claimed that it was a condition from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to remove Faiz.  The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, the army's media wing earlier this week said.  Three more retired officers were taken into military custody on Thursday in connection with the same housing scheme case.  Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank.  The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster.  The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said.  They said so far eight people have been taken into custody including the retired officers, in connection with the proceedings against Gen Faiz."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Army has taken three more retired military officers into custody “for their actions prejudicial to the military discipline”, in connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hamid, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. The military’s media wing said further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices were underway, who were involved in stirring up instability “at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests”. Moreover, sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank.  The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster.  The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said.  They said so far eight people have been taken into custody including the retired officers, in connection with the proceedings against Gen Faiz. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar hinted at more arrests after three more servicemen were taken into custody \"No one can be allowed to put the country's security at stake,\" he said. The minister went on to say that Lt Gen (retd) Faiz's actions were guided by PTI founder's \"wish\" and the former prime minister was \"leading them all\". \"All of it was being done at the behest of PTI founder. All of them are those people who damaged the country conniving with the anarchic group,\" he said, adding that accountability was needed for whatever this group had done. Tarar said that more arrests will follow as the investigations advance and more names are revealed. There is no pardon for harming the country, he added. On August 12, the ISPR said Gen Faiz had been taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the ISPR had said. Consequently, the ISPR had said appropriate disciplinary action had been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. It had added that multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement had also been established against the former general, who also served as Peshawar corps commander. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" the ISPR had said in the communique. The arrest was made in connection with a petition filed by a housing society's chief executive officer (CEO) in the Supreme Court last year, wherein the former ISI director general (DG) was accused of land grabbing and stealing valuables during a raid. In a plea filed with the apex court's human rights cell (HRC) in November 2023, the petitioner sought action against the former DG ISI. \"After the raid, I along with my five other colleagues were kept in confinement. The federal government should take action against Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid, his brother Najaf and others,\" the petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan stated in his petition. A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aminuddin Khan had heard the matter. The bench disposed of the petition on November 8, 2023, and directed the petitioner to approach the relevant forum against the retired general. In the written order, the bench had stated that the applicant had alleged that Lt Gen (retd) Hamid, who was then serving in the armed forces and working with the ISI, misused his office, and on his directions crimes were committed against the applicant and his family, as under: The written order further stated the learned additional attorney general (AAG) stated that there are a number of remedies available to the applicant, including approaching the Ministry of Defence as the complaint/grievance pertains to a period when the said respondents were serving officers in the Armed Forces and/or to file a criminal case, including one for malicious prosecution, and/or to file a suit for damages, or to do all these.” “The learned AAG also stated that if a complaint is addressed to the Ministry of Defence of the Government of Pakistan it will be given due consideration,” says the order, adding “the allegations are of an extremely serious nature, and if true, undoubtedly would undermine the reputation of the Federal Government, the Armed Forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.” Lt Gen (retd) Hamid had sought early retirement in November 2022 and his request was approved by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in December. He was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by the General Headquarters in the list of potential candidates for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC). The ex-DG ISI had served as Peshawar and Bahawalpur corps commander before his retirement."

  "content": "Security forces have killed seven terrorists and wounded five others during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkwa with the determination to eliminate the menace of terrorism, the military's media wing said on Thursday.  \"On August 15, 2024, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Kurram district on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. \"During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the Khwarij's location, as a result of which, seven Khwarij of Fitna Al Khawarij were sent to hell, while five of them got injured.\" The statement further said that the terrorists' hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered. The killed militants remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces as well as innocent civilians, it added.  The sanitisation operation was launched to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country, the ISPR said. Earlier this week, four soldiers were martyred while six terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between the miscreants and the security forces in South Waziristan, a statement issued by the military's media wing said late Tuesday night. “On night 12/ 13 August 2024, fire exchange took place between the security forces and Khwarij in South Waziristan District.” Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.  According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) stalwart Hammad Azhar has once again stepped down as the president of the party's Punjab chapter, citing lack of access to Imran Khan and restrictions on his movements as the reasons behind his decision.  The politician, who had also served as a federal minister during the PTI regime, remains in hiding amid fears of arrest as he is booked in several cases related to May 9 mayhem.   \"Unfortunately I do not have access to Imran Khan. I did not hold a press conference nor did any deal as my movement is very restricted and I cannot go to Adiala [jail],\" Azhar wrote on X.  The Imran Khan's loyalist expressed various grievances, one of them was not consulting him in the decisions taken within the PTI's Punjab organisation, as he said \"most of these decisions were based on lobbying\" instead of merit.  Moreover, he said limited access and provision of one-sided information to the PTI founder also concerned him.  Azhar cited Chaudhry Asghar's removal as PTI's Lahore president as one example of \"lobbying\", saying that the lobbyists wanted to replace Asghar and they succeeded today and got the desired directives from the jailed PTI founder by giving him the \"wrong facts\". The former federal minister said that the \"opponents\" of the deposed prime minister started misleading him against Asghar after his nomination as Lahore president, despite the latter's services for the party.   He stressed that the PTI leadership also \"agreed\" with him that the  Asghar's removal and many such decisions were a result of \"limited access to Khan sahab\".  The former federal minister also mentioned that Khan was not being informed about the troubles of PTI members in various other regions.  \"In this situation, it is not possible for me or during my presidency of Punjab to violate the merit and denotify the people who are performing and making sacrifices just because their voices cannot reach Khan sahab,\" he said.  The PTI leader recalled the first time he had resigned \"for the same reason that it is not possible for anyone to run the affairs without access to the party leaders\".   He further stated that those who have vested interests take advantage of the lack of communication with PTI founder. Azhar said that the major organisational responsibility should be vested only in those who have access to the party leader to convey complete facts to him.  \"Therefore, I am leaving the charge of the Punjab Presidency from today. I was a worker of Imran Khan and will remain so God willing,\" he concluded.  It may be noted that the PTI leader had stepped down from the posts of acting PTI Punjab president and general-secretary earlier in March, saying that the \"party would be best served by leadership present on ground\".  In response to Azhar's announcement of resignation, Asghar and PTI Lahore's Secretary-General Hafiz Zeeshan Rasheed also tendered their resignations.  \"I'm grateful to the workers for their support in our struggle for the release of PTI founder. I hope the upcoming Lahore president would be a better choice than me,\" he said. "

  "content": " LONDON: Pakistan’s former chief justice Saqib Nisar has confirmed he’s in London on the annual planned holidays but denounced the recent flurry of social media news that his absence from Pakistan may be linked with the arrest of General (retd) Faiz Hamid, the former chief of Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency who faces court martial for alleged misconduct in a case related to a private housing scheme. Speaking to this reporter over the phone, Nisar confirmed that he was in London. He said: “I am here to meet my friends and family. I will be visiting Scotland, Norway and then back to Pakistan in the first week of September. It's unfortunate how fake news is being spread against me. I am praying for the sanity of those who malign and target people just for the sake of it.” Social media news claimed the former CJP has fled to London and that he could be arrested in the wider inquiry related to the arrest of retired general but the former CJP rejected such speculations. He said there was no truth in what has been claimed by some people in the media and social media. Two days ago, the military said Gen Faiz had been arrested because there were “multiple instances of violation” of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. “The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,” it added. The military said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company’s owner. On Thursday, the military said three more retired officers were taken into military custody in connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of General (retd) Faiz. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that the retired officers were arrested for their actions prejudicial to military discipline. “Further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing,” it also said.  The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, sources said adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster. The two former brigadiers, accused of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said. The government has hinted at more arrests in the coming days."

  "content": "    Days after the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid was taken into custody by the Pakistan Army, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) founder Imran Khan has distanced himself from the retired general. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on August 12 announced the arrest of the former ISI chief, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said earlier this week. \"I have no connection with General (retd) Faiz,\" the incarcerated PTI leader said on Thursday while talking to journalists at Adiala Jail.  \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter.  Welcoming the development, the former premier said it was good that  army has launched the process of internal accountability, he noted. However, he urged the military to ensure that the process of accountability should be across the board. Responding to a question relating to his past engagement with the former spymaster, the 72-year-old cricketer-turned-politician said that while he was the premier he did not want to remove General Faiz from his office amid regime change in Afghanistan.   At the time, General Faiz was engaged with the Afghanistan government and Taliban, the PTI founder said, adding that the former army officer arranged his meeting with then US envoy on Afghanistan’s peace process Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives. The former ISI chief continued negotiations with the Taliban for three years as he enjoyed good relations with them, he noted, adding that the former serviceman was an asset for the country however, he was wasted.  The embattled PTI founder said that he exchanged heated words with the former army chief, General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa over the issue of removing the former ISI boss from his post, adding Bajwa removed Faiz for the sake of his extension. \"I repeatedly asked Bajwa not to remove Faiz but to no avail,\" he added. \"General (retd) Bajwa also toppled my government for the sake of his extension,\" he stressed, adding that he holds Bajwa responsible for the spike in terrorism in the country. Commenting on a statement by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif who had said the former spymaster was involved in the May 9 riots, Khan demanded an inquiry into to ascertain if the retired general was behind the violent protests. \"Khawaja Asif said that General Bajwa had sought extension. It is the endorsement of what I have been saying,\" he continued.  He also claimed that it was a condition from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to remove Faiz.  The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, the army's media wing earlier this week said.  Three more retired officers were taken into military custody on Thursday in connection with the same housing scheme case.  Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank.  The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster.  The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said.  They said so far eight people have been taken into custody including the retired officers, in connection with the proceedings against Gen Faiz."

  "content": "  The Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology on Thursday directed authorities concerned to resolve internet slowdown and social media issues within two weeks, seeking a report on the losses incurred in the wake of the problem. The directives came after the committee's members raised the issue of internet and social media applications being affected across the country. In a meeting, presided by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Palwasha Khan, officials of the IT ministry and Pakistan Telecommunications Authority were also present. During the meeting today, committee members decried the loss of IT infrastructure dependent businesses, particularly e-commerce firms. \"Internet slowdown has cost at least Rs500 million... Many e-commerce forums are leaving,\" said Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Afnan Ullah Khan. He also complained about the issue of uploading and downloading on WhatsApp and social media platforms. Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) said the slowdown of internet and social media apps is affecting business. \"You have destroyed people's jobs. Without investment, this method will destroy the entire business,\" he said, addressing the authorities. Responding to the concerns raised in the meeting, IT Ministry Secretary Aisha Humera Chaudhry said that the service of mobile operators has been disrupted, attributing it to a likely \"technical issue\" which she added will be \"resolved soon\" \"It is a problem on networks and not on Wi-Fi,\" she said. The PTA official, on the other hand, denied receiving \"any complaint\" regarding internet service. Meanwhile, the committee's agenda on the discussion around the firewall issue was postponed due to the non-availability of PTA officials. The authority was scheduled to present details regarding the firewall before the standing committee that had called for an in-camera briefing regarding the matter. Earlier today, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) blamed the issue on increased security and surveillance whose adverse repercussions, they added, might lead to severe economic repercussions. In a statement issued today, WISPAP chairman Shahzad Arshad revealed that internet speeds witnessed around 30% to 40% reduction which has had a devastating effect on businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity. The issue has been raised as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The issue has been attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience."

  "content": "Punjab government officials are withholding information about the luxury vehicles recently purchased for the offices of the speaker, deputy speaker, and other officials of the Punjab assembly. Opposition lawmakers allege that the provincial government has purchased five luxury cars, totaling Rs180 million, at taxpayer expense. On July 25, Punjab's Finance Minister Mujtaba Shuja ur Rehman confirmed the purchase of luxury vehicles for these positions. “The Punjab Assembly is the largest provincial assembly,” Rehman said during a media briefing. “All provincial assembly speakers have luxury cars, except ours.” Rehman explained that the vehicles were acquired to accommodate foreign dignitaries and delegations visiting Punjab but did not disclose the specific types of cars purchased or their total cost. The next day, in a televised press conference, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan reiterated this information. Khan defended the decision, stating, “I exercised good judgment by not opting for a high-end German luxury car, considering the country’s financial situation. The vehicles were acquired according to the rules. I only bought an off-road jeep.” Khan did not provide further details about the types or costs of the vehicles bought for his office. Geo Fact Check requested details and documentation regarding the purchases from speaker Khan on August 1. He replied on August 5, promising to provide the necessary information. But despite multiple follow-up reminders on August 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and on 13 no further response was received. Khan was also asked about the official car in use before the recent purchase but did not reply. Attempts to obtain information from Malik Zaheer Iqbal Channer, the deputy speaker, were also unsuccessful. However, the speaker's personal secretary sent a copy of the regulations governing the purchase of the vehicles to Geo Fact Check earlier this week. The regulations, titled The Punjab Secretariat Staff Car Regulations 2024, were framed as recently as March 30. They define luxury vehicles as those with an engine capacity exceeding 1800 cc and specify the types of vehicles permitted for various officials, including the speaker and deputy speaker. According to these regulations, a speaker is entitled to two luxury vehicles, with no restriction on fuel usage, as per the Punjab Provincial Assembly Speaker (Salary, Allowances, and Privileges) Act 1975. Similar benefits apply to the deputy speaker. The regulations also state that these vehicles may be used to transport foreign delegates, VVIPs, and guests of the speaker and deputy speaker. However, opposition lawmakers Ali Imtiaz Waraich and Ahmad Mujtaba Chaudhary, who were present at the assembly’s finance committee meeting where the car purchases were approved, allege while speaking to Geo Fact Check that five vehicles have been purchased: a Toyota Land Cruiser costing Rs90 million for the speaker’s office, two Toyota Fortuners for the deputy speaker and the secretary of the Punjab Assembly, and two Toyota Vigos. They claim the total expenditure amounts to Rs180 million. Follow us on @GeoFactCheck. If our readers detect any errors, we encourage them to contact us at [email protected]"

  "content": "    RAWALPINDI: In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, three more retired officers have been taken into military custody, the army’s media wing said on Thursday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that the retired officers were arrested for their actions prejudicial to military discipline. “Further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing,” it also said. Moreover, sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank.  The two retired brigadiers have been identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster.  The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said.  They said so far eight people have been taken into custody including the retired officers, in connection with the proceedings against Gen Faiz. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar hinted at more arrests after three more servicemen were taken into custody \"No one can be allowed to put the country's security at stake,\" he said.  The minister went on to say that Lt Gen (retd) Faiz's actions were guided by PTI founder's \"wish\" and the former prime minister was \"leading them all\".  \"All of it was being done at the behest of PTI founder. All of them are those people who damaged the country conniving with the anarchic group,\" he said, adding that accountability was needed for whatever this group had done.  Tarar said that more arrests will follow as the investigations advance and more names are revealed.  There is no pardon for harming the country, he added. On August 12, the ISPR said Gen Faiz had been taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the ISPR had said. Consequently, the ISPR had said appropriate disciplinary action had been initiated against the former spymaster under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act. It had added that multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement had also been established against the former general, who also served as Peshawar corps commander. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" the ISPR had said in the communique. The arrest was made in connection with a petition filed by a housing society's chief executive officer (CEO) in the Supreme Court last year, wherein the former ISI director general (DG) was accused of land grabbing and stealing valuables during a raid. In a plea filed with the apex court's human rights cell (HRC) in November 2023, the petitioner sought action against the former DG ISI. \"After the raid, I along with my five other colleagues were kept in confinement. The federal government should take action against Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid, his brother Najaf and others,\" the petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan had stated in his petition. A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aminuddin Khan had heard the matter. The bench disposed of the petition on November 8, 2023, and directed the petitioner to approach the relevant forum against the retired general. In the written order, the bench had stated that the applicant had alleged that Lt Gen (retd) Hamid, who was then serving in the armed forces and working with the ISI, misused his office, and on his directions crimes were committed against the applicant and his family, as under:   The written order further stated the learned additional attorney general (AAG) stated that there are a number of remedies available to the applicant, including approaching the Ministry of Defence as the complaint/grievance pertains to a period when the said respondents were serving officers in the Armed Forces and/or to file a criminal case, including one for malicious prosecution, and/or to file a suit for damages, or to do all these.” “The learned AAG also stated that if a complaint is addressed to the Ministry of Defence of the Government of Pakistan it will be given due consideration,” says the order, adding “the allegations are of an extremely serious nature, and if true, undoubtedly would undermine the reputation of the Federal Government, the Armed Forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.” Lt Gen (retd) Hamid had sought early retirement in November 2022 and his request was approved by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in December. He was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by the General Headquarters in the list of potential candidates for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC). The ex-DG ISI had served as Peshawar and Bahawalpur corps commander before his retirement."

  "description": "No internet sign can be seen on a phone in Karachi, on May 12, 2023, amid the government's blockage of internet services across country.   Geo.tvInternet speeds witnessed around 30%-40% reduction, says WISPAP.WISPAP chairman warns 'mass exodus' of businesses from Pakistan.\"... something is...",
  "content": "As internet users in Pakistan continue to reel under prevailing access and speed issues, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) has blamed the phenomenon on increased security and surveillance whose adverse repercussions might lead to severe economic repercussions. \"It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers [...] Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality anymore. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,\" said WISPAP Chairman Shahzad Arshad on Thursday. Elaborating on the prevailing issue, the WISPAP chairman revealed that internet speeds witnessed around 30% to 40% reduction which has had a devastating effect on businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity. Highlighting the adverse effects of internet-related issues on online and electronic-related businesses, the WISPAP chairman warned that these sectors, an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy, are now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival\". His remarks come as the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government and the country's top cyber regulator the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) have remained quiet as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The internet disruption is not only affecting citizens' rights but also causing financial losses to the national exchequer, as several online businesses, including e-commerce and ride-hailing services, are bearing the brunt of the restricted connectivity. Users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. The issue has been being attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media and is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Speaking on the issue during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', Farieha Aziz — co-founder of Bolo Bhi, an organisation working for digital rights — called out the government for maintaining ambiguity around the issue and highlighted the economic impact of internet slowdown. Commenting on the matter, she recalled how the government initially had denied suspension of X and had termed it as a technical glitch only to admit later that it had knowingly restricted the platform. \"Finally there is some acknowledgement about internet firewall,\" Aziz said. \"Maybe we'll get to know something [...] but something is cooking for sure,\" she added, referring to an in-camera meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom that is due today. Meanwhile, Nighat Dad — a lawyer and digital rights activist — also censured PM Shehbaz's administration for the prevailing obscurity around the issue during her appearance in 'Geo Pakistan'. Dad underlined how misinformation and fake news thrive in ambiguity and that the government was encouraging such behaviour where speculations are being made as people have been left in the dark. \"Who can you question if there's no accountability,\" she noted while adding that the prevailing issues were not technical glitches of social media and communications platforms. The experts' remarks come as internet disruption is not only affecting citizens' rights but also causing financial losses to the national exchequer, as several online businesses, including e-commerce and ride-hailing services, are bearing the brunt of the restricted connectivity. Users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. The internet restrictions and slowdown are being attributed to the alleged testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media and is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Last month, a report by The News had termed the then internet slowdown to a \"trial run of the firewall\" by the authorities. Lamenting the adverse effects of internet restrictions and slowdown, the Karachi-based activist noted that people's businesses and day-to-day communications on WhatsApp have also been affected leaving them unable to download media files on mobile data coupled with hampered WiFi speed. \"We still don't know what [technology] is being tested and to what extent [....] It seems that what is being done is that the internet traffic is being slowed down by creating bottlenecks,\" she added while noting that something was being done with \"network filtering for sure\". Touching upon the economic aftermath of internet-related issues, Aziz called out the incumbent government for talking about IT parks and digital Pakistan and said: \"Who is paying for all these expensive advertisements? Who will invest in Pakistan in such a situation when even Fiverr has termed the country as not being business-friendly saying that freelancers won't be able to deliver [on projects].\" Several people have lost their clients and the international market is viewing Pakistan as not being a viable digital market option for business, she said while stressing the need for the quantification of the economic repercussions. Echoing Aziz's views, Dad also noted that the country's gig economy relied heavily on internet and social media platforms, which are then used by the people and communities [for businesses] who don't have access to larger markets. \"If you [government] continue to do this in such a crippling economic situation, then 'Digital Pakistan ka Allah hi hafiz' (only God can save Digital Pakistan),\" she said while criticising the Centre for failure to hold an open dialogue on the issue and instead resorting to assumptions-based on unilateral decisions. The activist also highlighted that the government's security issues-related narrative over internet restrictions needs to be elaborated upon as to what specific concerns are there and from whom, which internal and external forces are involved in it. The internet firewall in question provisions filters that will block unwanted content from reaching the masses and will be used to inspect information originating from different internet protocol addresses. Last month, an official told The News that the measure would identify the locations from where the propaganda material originated and would then block or diminish the coverage of those accounts. There will be a keyword filtering system to detect content the government considers undesirable or prejudicial to national security etc. In such cases, the filter will act like an information inspector. These kinds of posts will likely be camouflaged and will subsequently be made invisible to outside users. Posts from all dissenting voices in and out of the country are likely to pass through this inspection before they are allowed to be made properly visible. This filter will run its check on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter). Preparation is also in progress to prevent the ‘misuse’ of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as the government can declare it mandatory for citizens to inform the PTA about the VPNs they are using. Anyone failing to do that could land in trouble. Commenting over the continuous disruption of digital platforms and slow internet, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) said that it had consistently advocated for a strong digital infrastructure as the backbone of Pakistan’s economic development. \"However, frequent internet disruptions, such as the one currently affecting the nation, as highlighted by the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), threaten this vision.\" Highlighting financial loss to the country's startups, it said: \"WISPAP has reported that, over the past few weeks, internet speeds have plummeted by 30 to 40%. It is important to note that in 2023, Pakistani startups raised just $75.8 million across 39 deals, reflecting a sharp year-over-year decline of 77% in funding and 42% in deal volume.  \"More significantly, freelancers generate over $1 billion in revenue for Pakistan’s economy each year, with this additional income being spent on local goods and services, thereby supporting other businesses,\" the OICCI's X post read. \"These setbacks, coupled with recurring internet curbs, exacerbate the challenges faced by the services sector and erode investor confidence. With Pakistan already struggling to attract FDI, these actions risk further isolating the country from the global digital economy.\" The OICCI warns that such disruptions could derail Pakistan's economic progress, stifle innovation, and severely impact the prospects for much-needed FDI — a vital component for the nation's economic revival."

The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leaders, currently jailed in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail, have urged Kashmiris to send a strong message to India that they reject its occupation and demand their fundamental right to self-determination. In their statements, they have appealed the international community to pressure India to grant Kashmiris their right to self-determination. The leaders reiterated the Kashmiris' resolve to take ongoing plebiscite demand to its logical conclusion. \"India has no legal or ethical right to celebrate its freedom in the occupied Kashmir. India’s occupation of Kashmir is a clear violation of the UN resolutions and international laws,\" they said.  On the other hand, Indian authorities have tightened restrictions across the Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on eve of India's Independence Day. Meanwhile, Kashmiri refugees held a demonstration against India at the Azadi Chowk in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Anti-India rallies followed by protest demonstrations in all small and major cities and towns on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC), will be the hallmark of the day. “Participants of the protest rallies will wear black bands around their arms as a sign of hatred against India,” the organisers of the special black day programmes had said earlier."

  "content": "KARACHI: As the city records light rain early in the morning today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast shows cloudy skies, drizzle and light rain in the port city in the next 24 hours. The PMD on Thursday recorded the minimum temperature in the metropolis at 28°C while the maximum temperature in the city is likely to be 30°C to 32°C. With 85% humidity and westward winds blowing at a speed of 13 kilometres per hour, the PMD forecast shows a possibility of light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta and Badin today. Additionally, the meteorological department forecasted rainfall in various parts of the country including Islamabad, with the possibility of downpour in some places. Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz has said that monsoon winds will enter lower Sindh from August 16, and under the influence of these winds, there is a possibility of rain in Karachi during August 17 to 19. He said that \"mostly moderate rain with thundershowers\" is expected in Karachi and \"there may be heavy rain at some areas\". The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of urban flooding, ahead of heavy rains which are expected to hit various parts of the country in coming days. Meanwhile, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the NDMA have indicated isolated heavy rains to hit catchment areas of Neelum and Jhelum rivers in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, the NEOC also expect more rainfall in districts Barkhan, Bolan, Harnai, Jaffarabad, Kohlu, Musakhel, Nasirabad, Sherani, Sibi, and Zhob of Balochistan and the Mirpur Khas Division, Dadu, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Larkana, Mithi, Matiari, Sanghar, and Sukkur of Sindh. The development comes after the recent rains resulted in as many as 178 fatalities, including 92 children, across the country since July with the collapse of homes being the biggest cause of death. The downpour, as per the NDMA, might cause urban flooding in various cities and flash flooding and landslides in hilly areas with an expected increase in the flow of water in the streams and nullahs. The government body has called on the authorities and the masses to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and landslides. It has also directed all relevant departments to alert emergency response teams and mobilised resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. Furthermore, tourists have been advised to avoid travelling to these areas during this time period."

  "content": "KARACHI: All private and public schools in Sindh resumed educational activities on Thursday after an extended summer vacation of two months and 14 days. The provincial government, last month, had extended summer break for educational institutions till August 14. Earlier, the summer vacations that commenced from June 1 were to end on July 31. In a statement, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah advised students to focus more on their education. He also urged the teachers to fulfil their responsibilities honestly, adding that merit-based recruitment of teachers improved the education system. “For the first time in the country, Sindh introduces teachers licence policy and other reforms,” the minister added. Last year, the Sindh government introduced a teaching licence policy to promote skilled professionals. The minister had said that the provincial government was taking \"revolutionary steps\" for reforms in the field of education, adding that the teaching licence policy would set new standards for educational excellence.  It is pertinent to mention here that the Sindh School Education and Literacy Department approved recommendations to start the new academic year in the primary and secondary educational institutions in August this year.  As per notification issued by the provincial department in February, the new academic year 2024-25 will begin on August 1, 2024, instead of April 1, 2024. The provincial education department had earlier decided in November last year to start the new academic year in the public and private schools on April 15, 2024."

  "description": "The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) issued an advisory on Thursday to ensure preparedness to deal with mpox, formerly called monkeypox, as the country’s first suspected case for 2024 was reported. Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has spread to neighbouring countries. Health ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah told Dawn.com today that a suspected case was reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.      “The suspected person has arrived from the Gulf. Samples have been collected from the suspect and sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for confirmation,” he said. Shah said the individual had minor symptoms of the viral infection but contact tracing was being carried out to avoid local transmission and some more samples were being sent to the NIH. The spokesperson said that all provinces were directed to appoint focal persons so that they could be contacted over mpox-related developments. “Moreover, Border Health Services has been directed to enhance monitoring at all entry points of the country,” he said. Meanwhile, an NCOC meeting was held in the NIH on the directions of Prime Minister’s Coordinator on Health Dr Malik Mukhtar. The meeting was physically or virtually attended by health authorities from across the country. According to an advisory issued by the forum, mpox was reported in all WHO regions, including 122 countries, with a total of 99,518 confirmed cases and 208 deaths to date. “While in Pakistan, a total of 11 cases with one death has been reported since first cases detected in April 2023,” it stated. The NIH said the advisory provided guidelines for dealing with the infection. It said that people affected could have rash and fever on their face and body with complaints of headache and body aches. The advisory said a patient would remain infected for two to four weeks. It said that patients infected with Monkeypox should be kept in isolation until recovery. The NIH asked people to take strict precautions, keep the environment clean and ensure the use of masks by medical staff besides ensuring a hand washing routine. The UN health agency’s declaration on the virus came the day after the African Union’s health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak. Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC. It is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. In May 2022, mpox infections surged worldwide, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the Clade 2b subclade. The WHO declared a public health emergency which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023. That outbreak, which has now largely subsided, caused some 140 deaths out of around 90,000 cases. The Clade 1b subclade, which has been surging in the DRC since September 2023, causes more severe disease than Clade 2b, with a higher fatality rate. Mpox kills 548 in DRC as case recorded in Sweden The DRC said the mpox outbreak has killed 548 people there this year, as the first case outside Africa of the virus’s more dangerous variant was recorded in a traveller in Sweden. DRC’s Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said in a video message that the country “has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year”, with all provinces affected. The DRC is made up of 26 provinces and has a population of around 100 million. The most affected provinces are South Kivu, North Kivu, Tshopo, Equateur, North Ubangi, Tshuapa, Mongala and Sankuru, Kamba said. He said the government had put in place a “national strategic plan for vaccination against mpox”, as well as improving surveillance of the disease at borders and checkpoints. The minister said that government-level working groups have been set up to boost contact tracing and help mobilise resources to “maintain control of this epidemic”. Meanwhile, Sweden’s Public Health Agency told AFP that it had registered a case of the same strain of the virus that has surged in the DRC since September 2023, known as the Clade 1b subclade. “A person who sought care” in Stockholm “has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the Clade I variant. It is the first case caused by Clade I to be diagnosed outside the African continent,” the agency said in a separate statement. The person was infected during a visit to “the part of Africa where there is a major outbreak of mpox clade I”, state epidemiologist Magnus Gisslen said in the statement. The agency added: “The fact that a patient with mpox is treated in the country does not affect the risk to the general population, a risk that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently considers very low.” The WHO said more imported Clade 1 mpox cases were likely to be confirmed in Europe soon. “The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world … there are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks,” the WHO’s European regional office said in a statement. Vaccine drive Separately, global vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on getting shots to countries affected by the escalating mpox outbreak, its chief executive Sania Nishtar told Reuters. The money is available in the organisation’s “First Response” fund, which was set up after global health agencies like Gavi were left behind by high-income countries in procuring vaccines during the early days of Covid-19. It can be used to respond to health emergencies. The funds are largely left over from money donated by governments and global health funders for the Covid-19 response. The money for the vaccines is ready to be tapped into, Nishtar said, but there were hurdles to clear, including official requests for vaccines from affected countries, as well as approvals of the vaccines from the WHO. Gavi and Unicef, which work together to buy vaccines, cannot do so without WHO approving them. On Wednesday, the global health agency said it was hoping to finalise its evaluation of the vaccines by September. Nishtar said Gavi was also in early talks with the manufacturers of the two mpox vaccines that are widely used, made by Bavarian Nordic and LM Biologics. Official orders can only proceed after approval, she said. Bavarian Nordic has said it can make 10 million doses by the end of 2025. “We have already significant capacity in place and can easily handle delivery of all doses needed for the outbreak,” a Bavarian Nordic spokesman said by email. “But we need someone to buy the doses. None of the organisations have shown interest so far,” he added, without providing details. LC Biologics said in an email it would cooperate with WHO as much as possible. In the meantime, Gavi is coordinating with countries like the United States, which has had 50,000 doses available for donation for months. Bavarian Nordic has also donated 15,000 doses. However, the DRC has yet to make an official request for the shots, which Nishtar said was a delaying factor, along with arranging legal processes and deployment plans for vaccination.

  "description": "Pakistan’s health ministry on Friday confirmed at least one case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, withdrawing a previous statement that three mpox patients had been detected in the country. Coordinator to Prime Minister for Health Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath addressed the urgency of the situation following the confirmation of a positive mpox case in the Mardan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the affected individual had recently returned from a Gulf country. Health Ministry Spokesperson Sajid Shah said that contact tracing efforts for the infected individual of Mardan had already commenced, with additional samples being collected from potential contacts. Shah said that that it would not be clear which variant of mpox the patient had until the process was complete. A new form of the virus has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. A case of the new variant was confirmed on Thursday in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. However, the World Health Organisation has advised against any travel restrictions to stop the spread of mpox.      The health department in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province said on Friday that one mpox case had been confirmed in the area, withdrawing a previous statement that three mpox patients had been detected there this week on arrival from the United Arab Emirates. A health officer in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district said the location of the confirmed mpox patient, a man the officer said had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was unknown. He had initially received tests and advice at a hospital in the provincial capital Peshawar, Dr Javed Iqbal told Reuters, but later returned to his home a few hours away in Mardan and then went to another district. “When we visited his home in Mardan, it was locked from outside and his neighbours told us that the family has left for Dir,” said the DHO Mardan. “We approached our fellow colleagues of the health department in Dir district, but they couldn’t trace him even in Dir.” The national health ministry said it was carrying out contact tracing of the patient it had identified, who they said was from Mardan. They were also boosting airport surveillance and monitoring with extra health personnel, the ministry said in a statement. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant of the virus was identified. Health Ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah said so far they had no confirmation of the new variant, but the sequencing of the sample of the confirmed patient was underway. “Once that’s done, we will be able to say what strain is this,” said Shah. “Health personnel across the country will be visiting airports to oversee the screening and surveillance systems, ensuring that protocols are effectively in place. This initiative aims to bolster coordination between airport authorities and provincial health departments,” he said. “The ministry of health remains committed to taking practical steps to safeguard the public from illnesses and outbreaks, underscoring the collective efforts being made to ensure community health safety amid the mpox threat. As the situation evolves, health officials will continue to monitor developments closely, prioritising public health and safety across the nation,” Sajid Shah said. Global health officials on Thursday confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden and linked it to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO on Wednesday sounded its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in Congo since the current outbreak began in January 2023. This year alone, the disease has killed 548 people so far in the African country. The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications. Mpox vaccine maker seeks approval for use in teens Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic said it was seeking European approval to use its mpox vaccine in children aged 12 to 17, after the WHO declared the current virus surge a global public health emergency. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is currently only approved for people 18 years and older. “Children and adolescents are disproportionately affected by mpox in the ongoing outbreak in Africa, highlighting the importance and urgency to broaden the access to vaccines and therapies for this vulnerable population,” Bavarian Nordic chief executive Paul Chaplin said in a statement. The company said it had presented the European Medicines Agency with clinical data from a study which showed “non-inferiority of immune responses from mpox/smallpox vaccination in adolescents and (a) similar safety profile compared to adults.” The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the vaccine an “emergency use authorisation” for adolescents during the 2022 global mpox outbreak.  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that two more cases of mpox were detected in KP. The error is regretted. "

  "description": "The Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Shakil Ahmad grilled the state counsel on Friday for his lack of “knowledge” and “seriousness” about recent internet disruptions across the country. Major online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been hit hard since last week with users reporting slowdowns and difficulties in accessing messaging and social media applications. After months of speculation about the installation of a so-called ‘firewall’ that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed a day ago that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cyber security threats.      Minister of State for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja has said the government had sought a report from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and other institutions over the internet disruption. Meanwhile, PTA officials told a Senate committee that the telecom regulator was “assessing the issue”. Moreover, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) has warned that the country’s economy could lose up to $300 million and freelancing platform Fiverr has made several accounts in Pakistan “unavailable”. Justice Ahmad took up a petition today filed a day ago by Advocate Muhammad Nadeem, a Lahore resident. At the outset of the hearing, the judge ordered that the federal government’s counsel appear before the court by 12pm after consulting the relevant authorities. When the hearing resumed, state counsel Rana Nauman appeared before the court and requested that the government be given some time to submit a “detailed report on the internet outages”. “We will have to ask the PTA why the internet is slow [and] what has happened,” the counsel contended. At this, Justice Ahmad observed: “This is a matter of public interest and your seriousness is such that you do not even have adequate information [about this issue].” The judge then said he was serving his verdict on the matter. Reiterating that the petition pertained to public interest, Justice Ahmad said he would issue appropriate directives on it. Petition The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed on Thursday by Advocate Muhammad Nadeem. The federal government — through the law and information ministries as well as the cabinet division secretary — along with the PTA chairman were named as respondents in the case. It requested that the “action of the federal government (internet shutdowns) be declared to be unconstitutional and unlawful being inconsistent” with various articles of the Constitution. According to the petition, the actions were in violation of Articles 9 (security of person), 18 (freedom of trade, business or profession), 19 (freedom of speech, etc), 19A (right to information) and 25A (equality of citizens). It further urged the court to order the federal government to “ensure uninterrupted internet services throughout” the country. “If internet shutdowns in the interest of national security and in the wake of law and order, same is to be intimated to public at large prior to closure citing reasons for closer and providing time frame as to duration of internet closure,” the petition read. It argued that “by blocking, filtering, or shutting down these services, the government is eroding civic space; fostering a climate of economic uncertainty and disrupting access to healthcare, online business, emergency services and financial services.” “Apart from the general public, hundreds, if not thousands, of companies have also been affected. Ride-hailing companies like Bykea, Careem and InDrive have taken the brunt, as their users — both drivers and passengers — need mobile data on the go,” the petition argued. “Should these shutdowns continue even if they are limited to certain social media platforms they are likely to have far-reaching implications for investor confidence, export growth, and the country’s reputation in the global technology market,” it warned.

  "description": "Three Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) terrorists were killed while one was injured during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in North Waziristan’s Razmak area, the military’s media wing confirmed on Friday. According to a press release from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out after security forces were informed of the presence of terrorists in the area. “During [the] conduct of the operation, intense fire exchange took place between own troops and khwarij, as a result of which, 3 Khwarij of Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell, while one kharji got injured,” the ISPR said. It added that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from slain terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces as well as target killing of innocent civilians. “Sanitisation of the area is being carried out to eliminate any other Kharji found in the area as security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of khawarij and terrorism from the country,” the statement added. Earlier this month, the government declared TTP as Fitna al-Khawarij and all other terrorists associated with the group as khariji (outcasts). Speaking during a press conference, ISPR Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the move was made because the TTP was a “mischief-making group” that was “neither an ideology nor has anything to do with Islam or Pakistan.” He had added that security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) conducted 23,622 small and large-scale IBOs in the country this year, out of which 2,045 operations were carried out in the second half of July. A day prior, seven TTP terrorists were killed by security forces during another IBO in KP’s Kurram district. The country has lately witnessed a sharp uptick in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and KP. Attacks escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces. Islamabad has blamed Kabul for allowing the TTP — a separate group but aligned with the Afghan Taliban — to use Afghan soil for launching attacks inside Pakistan. However, the Taliban administration has denied the charges. "

  "description": "PTI MNA Muhammad Iqbal Afridi objected to a woman’s outfit during a meeting of a National Assembly standing committee, following which the panel’s chairman, Muhammad Idrees, apologised over the matter. Afridi objected to the attire of a high-ranking K-Electric official who attended the power division committee’s meeting today at Parliament House. The lawmaker said he raised the issue after the KE official had briefed the panel and left the meeting room.         According to a notification shared by the NA Committees’ official X account, one of the items on the meeting’s agenda was a “comprehensive report/implementation status” of previous recommendations about issues raised by MNAs Afridi and Syed Rafiullah “regarding the disconnection overbilling and unannounced load-shedding of electricity in Karachi and erstwhile Fata”. Afridi is not a member of the NA committee but was present as a lawmaker from NA-27 (Khyber) who had raised the matter of load-shedding. Afridi termed the KE official’s attire “objectionable”, adding that she “should not have attended the meeting in such an outfit”. The PTI lawmaker also said that “standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be devised for women’s clothing”.      Responding to a query if his objection was “ethically correct”, Afridi stressed that the venue was the NA’s standing committee and attended by many people. “If people come [to gatherings] in such a manner in a respectable society, what will children say?” he asked, adding that the public “learned” from watching them. “There should not be such democracy here that ruins a society,” Afridi insisted. He went on to claim that the “manner in which the other woman came risks ruining the system or the society”. “In my opinion, such people showing up in society is not right.” Meanwhile, Idrees, the power committee’s chairman who presided over the meeting, apologised for the incident, saying it was “inappropriate”.    PML-N’s Muhammad Idrees, chairman of NA’s standing committee on power, speaks to media in Islamabad on Aug 16. — screengrab via author  Asked if someone had the “right” to object to a woman’s dress, Idrees said, “No […] it is an individual’s [choice].” He said that it was “inappropriate” to object to it, adding: “What he did would have happened under some misunderstanding. “It does not happen on our forum that someone disrespects or says something like this […] Even if it did happen, then I apologise,” the committee chief said. ‘Regrettable, unacceptable harassment’ Afridi’s comments were criticised harshly by fellow lawmakers. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said Afridi’s objection to the woman’s dress was “regrettable and condemnable”. “Who has made male MNAs ‘policemen’ on women’s clothing?” she asked in a post on X.         The senior politician said that the woman “must have reached that position owing to her abilities and qualifications” and that Afridi, being a committee member, should have respected her. “Such objections show a conservative and patriarchal mindset that tries to keep women under their control by targeting their clothes,” Rehman said, adding that such thinking was a “hindrance” to achieving gender equality in the country. “We want women to be judged by their ideas and services, not by their looks or clothes,” the senator asserted. “Women have the full right to attend any professional environment in clothes that they prefer and are comfortable for them.” The PPP senator said her party “rejected such discriminatory and contemptuous statements”. Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar called on the PTI to take action against Afridi, urging it to suspend their lawmaker’s party membership.      In a statement, Tarar said harassment against women was “not acceptable under any circumstances”. Referring to the PTI, the PML-N MNA quipped that the “movement of justice has become a movement of injustice for women”. “Women in our society already face a lot of difficulties,” the information minister said, terming the incident “PTI’s fascism that was coming out in the open”. ‘Regrettable incident, no amount of condemnation will suffice’ Dr Shahida Rehmani, secretary Women Parliamentary Caucus (WPC), said that the incident was regrettable, adding that no amount of condemnation for such incidents would suffice. “But until when will we keep condemning [such incidents]” she asked in a video message, adding that “elements” such as the PTI MNA were “burdened by slave mentality” and wanted to “keep women subjugated forever”. “There is a law for it,” she said, requesting the NA speaker to register a first information report (FIR) against such members. She also called for the suspension of their Parliament membership, adding that commenting on the clothing of women was highly condemnable given that women had climbed their way to such honourable positions because of their ability. “The constitution of Pakistan and Islam give women the freedom to wear whatever they want and if they [women] are to progress, it would be based on their ability,” she said.

  "description": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Friday lauded javelin champion Arshad Nadeem’s “remarkable achievement” of setting a new Olympic record and bringing a gold medal home, attributing it to the athlete’s “commitment, perseverance, and passion for excellence”, the military’s media wing said. The athlete hurled the country to its first single gold medal in the Paris Olympics with a 92.97 metre throw on his second attempt. His win was Pakistan’s first individual gold medal, first track and field medal as well as the second time a South Asian has had a podium finish in track and field. The nation celebrated as the athlete received a hero’s welcome in Mian Channu, along with the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, and over Rs155 million in cash prizes. Sindh leaders also honoured him for his historic achievement. On Friday, General Munir met Nadeem during a ceremony held at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to celebrate the athlete’s historic achievement. “COAS appreciated Arshad Nadeem’s remarkable achievement of winning Pakistan’s first-ever gold medal in a singles’ event and setting a new Olympic record, attributing it to his commitment, perseverance, and passion for excellence,” the statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. The army chief highlighted Nadeem’s inspirational journey from humble beginnings to achieving greatness, emphasizing the importance of hard work and determination. The ceremony, according to the statement, was attended by teams from different sports, including legendary Olympians such as the 1984 hockey team which had won gold.      “COAS reaffirmed the commitment to support and empower not only sportsmen, but the entire wealth of Pakistani youth to achieve excellence towards a prosperous Pakistan,” the statement said, adding that Gen Munir also highlighted the need for youth engagement, development, and entertainment as essential cardinals of a healthy and prosperous society.      Thanking the army chief, Nadeem emphasized the immense potential of Pakistani youth, stressing the importance of hard work, positivity, and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving success.    Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir meeting javelin champion Arshad Nadeem’s mother at GHQ on Friday.—Photo courtesy: ISPR  Nadeem, in a post on X later, said the warm welcome he received filled him with “immense pride”, adding that it was truly humbling to be surrounded by such esteemed company.         “Alongside various army generals, members of the Pakistani cricket team, and other important athletes, I was privileged to serve as the chief guest for this special ceremony,” he said. “I was also given the opportunity to address the gathering, sharing my thoughts and gratitude. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the army chief and all the distinguished athletes for their support and encouragement,” he added. "

  "description": "Former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on Friday announced that the Punjab government will reduce per unit electricity prices to Rs14 per unit for consumer bills for August and September. Amid rising electricity bills, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) last week announced an increase in electricity tariffs by Rs2.56 per unit, marking the second consecutive incr­ease, as there was a Rs3.33 per unit rise for fuel adjustment in May. The inflated bills particularly affected lifeline consumers (using 51-100 units per month) and those in the protected category (up to 200 monthly units), as they were pushed out of the monthly ceiling, resulting in higher rates than their actual consumption warranted. Addressing a joint press conference in Lahore along with his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the former premier lauded her for masterminding the programme. “Those who use 200 units have received relief in their bills,” Nawaz said. “Maryam tells me that the bills are higher due to the hot weather, so she has ordered a relief package to reduce customer bills in August and September. Those consuming between 0-500 units will receive a reduction of Rs14 per unit.”            View this post on Instagram              The ex-premier lamented the astronomical increase in living costs compared to his last tenure in power, which ended in 2017 when he was disqualified from office. He said that power bills in his previous administration cost Rs1,600. “On October 21, when I spoke at the Minar-i-Pakistan, I talked about electricity bills at length and compared the prices in my tenure with the ones today,” Nawaz said. “I understand people’s pain. “I keep thinking back to 2017 because there was no inflation, we were prospering and people could make ends meet. People were able to live lives easily. It was a good time, people could get vegetables for Rs10 per kilo,” he reminisced.      He added that when the PML-N took over in 2013, Pakistan was “about to default”, claiming that his government not only “remedied this country’s problems but made it one of the fastest-progressing in the world”. “The dollar stayed at Rs104 until I was disqualified from office,” he stated. “I was removed by some judges because I took 10,000 dirhams from my son.” The ex-premier claimed that his ouster was a major contributor to the country’s economic decline over the last 7 years. “They removed me when people paid Rs1,600 for bills, now they are paying Rs18,000; they can’t send their kids to school because they can’t pay the fees,” he stressed. “Those who removed me have made the lives of the common man very difficult and harmed the nation,” Nawaz claimed, adding that it was during his tenure that he “shook hands and said goodbye to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)”. The PML-N president added that he was the one to bid farewell to IMF loans, but Imran Khan brought them back when he took office. “We were free of their [IMF’s] control. If had the chance to keep serving, the dollar would stay at Rs104.” Nawaz went on to say that his government had already resolved loadshedding, and people had witnessed that firsthand. Referring to how he worked with then-Punjab CM and current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said, “We used to work day and night to make sure these power plants were built. We brought CPEC during my administration.” Lamenting the power hikes, the ex-premier said, “The bills are Rs18,000 today, how can the poor afford this? Their entire salary goes into paying bills, they haven’t got enough to keep their children fed.”            View this post on Instagram              He announced that the Punjab government cut spending and diverted funding from development projects to achieve this. “Well done, Maryam,” he said to his daughter. “This government has extended as much relief as it can. Rs45bn has been spent on lowering the power tariffs.” Nawaz further announced that in the future, a solar panel scheme will be implemented to provide citizens with solar panels. “This will give them a further reduction in their bills,” he said, elaborating the program will cost Rs700bn and target the lower-middle class. People will receive relief and peace of mind and their spending will decrease, he said. “I applaud the Punjab government and PM Shehbaz. Aside from Punjab, he should also get involved with other provinces to provide solar panels.” "

  "description": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday ordered the Lahore police to recover YouTuber Aun Ali Khosa, who was allegedly “taken into custody by some unknown armed men”, by August 20. A day ago, Aun’s wife Binish Iqbal filed a petition in the LHC, a copy of which is seen by Dawn.com, claiming that her husband was “in the unlawful and illegal custody of the law enforcement authorities”. Iqbal stated that the whereabouts of Aun were unknown and she feared for his “safety having strong apprehension that his husband has been a victim of enforced disappearance.” Justice Shahbaz Ali Rizvi heard the petition today and ordered the Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO) to produce the “abducted” artist in the court on August 20. Meanwhile, Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran has said that the police had not received any complaint about the alleged abduction of Aun, adding that the police would investigate the matter after receiving any complaint. The petition According to the petition, Aun was a “digital content creator, a writer, and a dignified comedian/artist having a massive following of 137,000 subscribers on YouTube”. It claimed that at 2am on August 15, a dozen police officials and “men with masked faces in plain clothes” barged into his apartment after breaking apart the entrance door. The heavily armed men confiscated Aun’s phone, laptop, computer system, and digital camera, the petition further detailed. “The petitioner followed them as they left in a Fortuner and a Black Revo double cabin vehicle. After manhandling him and shoving him into the Black Vigo parked outside the flat, they fled,” the petition alleged. It added that the petitioner repeatedly asked the men the reason for picking him up but they refused to provide any information and left. Appeal to spread the word Taking to platform X on August 15, the artist’s brother, Ali Sher Khosa, said  Aun had been “taken into custody by some unknown armed men from his flat in Lahore”. He asked people to pray for Aun’s recovery while also requesting everyone to spread the word.         In a post on X today, Khosa rebuffed reports that his family was “receiving threats”. “This is fake news! Please stop spreading it. We have not received any threat calls from anyone,” he said.         Rights activist, group condemn incident The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said that it was alarmed by reports that the digital content creator was “abducted” allegedly by unknown armed men from his home in Lahore. HRCP said it was concerned that the incident may be related to his work as a satirist and called for his immediate recovery.         Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir, in a satirical post on X, said that the “abduction” of the video blogger was “proof” that people’s laughter could also bring “instability” to the country.         “For stability, it is important that the people remain quiet, do not question and silently tolerate fascism,” Nasir said. “No need to use your brain. The state will tell when to be happy, when to laugh, when to cry,” he added. "

  "description": "At least three people drowned after a chairlift collapsed and fell into the Indus River in Seo Tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Kohistan District on Friday, officials said. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Abdur Rehman told Dawn.com that the chairlift fell into the river after the foundations supporting the aerial lift collapsed on both sides. The foundations of the manually operated cable car had become weak due to a very high flow of water in the river over the last two days, he explained. Dasu Station House Officer (SHO) Khalilur Rehman also confirmed the incident, stating that “three persons drowned in the river after the fall”. He said the chairlift was being used by the residents of Kama village and it was connected with Dasu city. Rescue 1122 identified the victims as Muhammad Sher, Fidaur Rehman, and Mir Alam — all of whom were residents of Kaiga — and continued searching for the bodies. The victims’ relatives told police they were returning to the village from Dasu via the cable car when it fell. Kohistan administration also called a Rescue 1122 team from Shangla to participate in the search, while the high flow of water in the Indus River hampered the rescue operation. Make-shift cable cars are commonly found in many parts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, connecting different towns and villages where roads or bridges cannot be built due to the terrain. People use these cable cars as a means of transport. Last month on July 23, a man drowned in the river Indus in the Bisham area while trying to rescue his son, who was stranded on a chairlift. Eyewitness Mansoor Ali Khan told Dawn.com that a 13-year-old boy was stranded in the chairlift over the Indus river and his father, Muhammad Aziz, was trying to rescue his son through a rope. Khan said the rope through which the father was trying to rescue his son snapped, causing the former to fall into the river and be swept away by the strong currents. He said that the boy remained stuck in the chairlift and was rescued by locals after hectic efforts. Last year, eight people, including six children, in KP’s Battagram were left stranded in a chairlift when the wires of the lift snapped. The chairlift remained dangling in the middle of a deep ravine surrounded by towering mountains and a rocky surface along with the Jhangri River for hours before the army rescued all passengers with the help of the locals.

  "description": "Five people, including two policemen, were injured in a Friday morning blast in Peshawar, according to a police official. “A police van was on patrol when a remote-controlled IED (improvised explosive device) exploded,” Warsak Superintendent of Police (SP) Arshad Khan told Dawn.com. The incident occurred at around 9am, according to the police official. “Four to five kilogrammes of explosives were used in the blast,” SP Arshad noted. “Six to seven suspects have also been detained for investigation,” he added. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Kashif Zulfiqar told Dawn.com that evidence has been collected from the crime scene. “There has been an increase in terrorist attacks on Warsak Road,” SSP Zulfiqar said. “A few days ago, a grenade was thrown at the Mathura police station.” SSP Zulfiqar said that police are working with the counter-terrorism department (CTD) in the area. “A joint operation will be conducted in the areas of Warsak Road.” “The group involved in terrorist activities will soon be exposed,” he added. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks on police officials and checkposts, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Attacks escalated after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces. On Wednesday, a head constable was martyred and a constable suffered injuries when unidentified militants hurled a hand grenade on a check post in Mayar, Lower Dir. Last month, a constable was injured when militants attacked a police post in Peshawar’s Regi Model Town on the city’s outskirts. In January 2023, a suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines killed 100 people, many of whom were police officials. TTP had claimed responsibility for the attack. It later distanced itself from it but sources earlier indicated that it might have been the handiwork of some local faction of the outlawed group. "

  "description": "• IT minister says ‘web management system’ is being updated for increased cyber security • Senate committee discusses issues faced by online businesses, fears losses in IT exports • Software houses, business bodies demand restoration of normal speeds ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: After months of speculation about the installation of a so-called ‘firewall’ that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed on Thursday that the government was indeed upgrading its ‘web management system’ to cope with cyber security threats. Despite the rather ambiguous terminology used by Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja, this was the first time an official had acknowledged the government’s actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data. So far, official stakeholders — Ms Khawaja’s ministry and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) — had either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta. Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp. Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1pm. The services of ISPs, including PTCL, Zong and Nayatel were also affected during the day. ‘Web management system’ While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting, Ms Fatima said the government had sought a report from PTA and other institutions over the internet disruption. “The internet should never be slow. We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher internet speed are underway.” When the minister was asked about the ‘firewall’ — a blanket term used by the public to describe the causes of internet disruption in the absence of any official explanation — she said the issue had been “blown out of proportion”. “The government has been operating a web-management system. The system is now being upgraded.” She also called the process “a routine exercise” across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system. “It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.” Senate body meeting Earlier, during the Sen­ate committee’s meeting, lawmakers highlighted internet disruptions and claimed they were causing severe hindrances for online businesses. Senator Afnanullah Khan of PML-N stated that the country was already facing an enormous economic crisis, and if the internet issue was not resolved, IT sector exports could fall significantly. The Ministry of IT and Telecommunications secretary, Aisha Humera Chaudhry, told the meeting that there were no issues with broadband connections, but those using mobile data were facing disruptions. Officials of PTA told the committee that the telecom regulator was “assessing the issue” and the ministry would be in a better position to provide an overview in two weeks once the assessment is completed. However, when Dawn contacted PTA, its spokesperson expressed complete ignorance about the connectivity issues faced by users on Thursday. Despite official stone-walling, users continued to face agonisingly slow internet, and even loss of businesses. “In the past, it used to be just YouTube and Facebook. Now WhatsApp is the latest casualty,” said a serving armed forces officer who said they were unable to send or receive files before an important meeting. Dr Amir Abbasi, a professor at Islamabad’s Quaid-i-Azam University, claimed that the work of his students has also been affected. “Over the past two weeks, students have struggled to meet project deadlines,” he said, adding that this has raised concerns among academic institutions. “After years of [efforts] to build relationships with international organisations, missing deadlines damages our reputation.” On actions required to address the issue, Prof Abbasi said forming committees was no longer enough. “There is a clear disconnect between policymakers and the public. The government must recognise the severe impact of these disruptions, particularly on students, and abandon outdated practices such as installing firewalls if Pakistan is to progress.” More bodies decry disruptions In a press release on Thursday, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) said the economy could lose up to $300 million due to internet disruptions, Reuters reported. The statement came a day after the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan warned businesses were considering relocating operations to other countries as internet speed has plummeted by 30 to 40 per cent in the past few weeks.      In its statement, P@SHA said that the government’s lack of transparency around the firewall had “ignited a firestorm of distrust” among internet users and Pakistan’s global IT clients who fear their proprietary data and privacy will be compromised. Ali Ihsan, the senior vice chairman of P@SHA, said the imposition of the firewall has already caused prolonged internet disconnections and erratic VPN performance, threatening a “complete meltdown of business operations”. “These disruptions are not mere inconveniences; but, a direct, tangible and aggressive assault on the industry’s viability inflicting an estimated and devastating financial losses estimated to reach $300 million, which can further increase exponentially,” he said in the statement. The body of software houses demanded an “immediate and unconditional halt to this digital siege” and called on the government to engage with the industry to develop a cybersecurity framework. A separate statement by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) said frequent internet disruptions would stifle innovation, and severely diminish the prospects for much-needed foreign direct investment — a must-need for the economic revival. OICCI Secretary Gen­eral and CEO M. Abdul Aleem claimed internet disruptions have disproportionately impacted freelancers who generate “over one billion dollars in revenue for Pakistan’s economy each year”. Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh said his organisation has received a large number of complaints from its members who have been facing issues in communicating with their clients for the last week due to disruptions in the services of social media platforms, particularly WhatsApp. “In the era of digitalisation, Pakistan cannot afford such delays in restoring internet connectivity which must be restored at the earliest,” the KCCI chief added.

  "description": "QUETTA/GWADAR: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Thursday that intelligence information and evidence indicate that the deputy commissioner of Panjgur, Zakir Baloch, was martyred by the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). He said he has no sympathy for those who receive funds from “the Indian agency RAW to kill innocent people”. The chief minister said the family of the martyred Zakir Baloch will not be left alone and the provincial government will provide a job to his widow according to her qualifications. The government will also bear educational expenses of Mr Baloch’s children. Speaking at a press conference at the CM Secretariat, Mr Bugti condemned the killing of a woman in a hand grenade attack on Aug 13, adding that it is against the Baloch traditions to attack women.  CM, corps commander visit Zakir Baloch’s house; widow to get govt job  The chief minister said the youth must be made aware that those committing such acts are enemies of the country and they have been funded allegedly by RAW. He said the government’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness and that a strong action will be taken against those who challenge the state’s authority. The chief minister further said that the government has intelligence reports that the banned BLA is involved in the incident. Referring to the situation in Chaman, he said the issue of passports for the people in Chaman has been resolved and provincial government will bear passport expenses of the Chaman people. He said Rs90 million has already been allocated for this purpose by the provincial government. He announced that the government college in Hoshab will be named after martyred Zakir Baloch. He appealed to the people not to be part of conspiracies, as some the youth are being pushed into a situation of hopelessness. The chief minister claimed that three agreements were signed with the Baloch Solidarity Committee, but the committee broke all these agreements. Despite this, he said, the government has shown restraint. He said that while the government is open to talks, it will not compromise on the state’s authority. He said there will be no sympathy for those who are involved in acts of terrorism and those who challenge the state’s authority and kill workers and ordinary people will be dealt with harshly. CM, corps commander’s visit Chief Minister Bugti and Corps Commander of Quetta Rahat Nasim Khan also visited the residence of the late deputy commissioner of Panjgur and offered condolences to the father of the martyred officer and other family members on Thursday. They prayed for high ranks of the martyred DC and said that his sacrifice for the country will never be forgotten. Mr Bugti said the blood of martyrs like Zakir Baloch is never wasted, and they are the national heroes who have given their lives for the country and nation. Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Two brigadiers, colonel arrested in connection with Faiz Hameed’s court martial • More being probed for inciting ‘instability’ in collusion with ‘vested political interests’ • Tarar says whoever compromised security will face the music ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: After the military announc­­ed the arrest of three more retired officers on Thursday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar disclosed that more arrests would be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief retired Gen Faiz Hameed, in days to come. “Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely which can be in the army and elsewhere,” the minister told journalists in Lahore. “It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country’s security…all those will come in its grasp,” he declared. The minister’s remarks came hours after the army announced the arrest of three additional retired officers. In a statement, the military’s public affairs division — ISPR — revealed, “In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.” The ISPR noted that more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests. However, ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested, and did not indicate when the arrests had been made.      Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the Top City housing society case, Mr Tarar said the institution of army had prioritised self-accountability. “We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.” Mr Tarar said when no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-PM Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. “[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,” he alleged. Taking note of the ISPR statement, Mr Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread and attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were attacks on security. He alleged that this collusion and conspiracies were being concocted on the “direction and will of Imran Khan”. “I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,” he said, adding that Mr Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but he would not be able to save his neck. ‘Numerous in custody’ The ISPR announcement follows speculations that numerous retired officers had been detained in relation to Gen Faiz Hameed’s trial for his post-retirement actions that violated Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court. Gen Hameed was arrested around Aug 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday. His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of Pakistan Army. The ISPR did not initially disclose the identities of the three officers who were taken into custody. However, media reports claimed they were identified as retired Brig Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; retired Brig Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and retired Col Asim. Brigadiers Ghaffar and Fakhar were also implicated in the SC petition filed by the owner of Top City housing society. The petition accused the two of extorting Rs40 million and coercing the sponsorship of a private TV channel. Veterans’ meeting    Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir (centre) interacts with retired army officers during a reception in honour of veterans in Rawalpindi, on Thursday. Former army chiefs Raheel Sharif and Ashfaq Parvez Kayani were also among the guests.—PPI  Separately, at a reception for veterans held in connection with Independence Day, Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir cautioned against the insidious threat of misinformation and propaganda being perpetrated by “inimical elements to weaken the bond between the people of Pakistan and the armed forces”. According to a statement, issued by ISPR on Thursday, the army chief paid heartfelt tribute to the contributions of the retired personnel, lauding their dedication and instrumental role in shaping the nation’s history. He emphasised the paramount importance of unity and resilience in the face of challenges, urging veterans to continue playing a vital role in Pakistan’s progress and development. Veterans expressed faith and confidence in the army leadership and pledged their support in combating both internal and external security challenges, the statement said. The gathering was also attended by former army chiefs, retired generals Raheel Sharif and Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Says possibility of Faiz Hameed’s role in events of May 9 ‘should be investigated’ • Accuses top functionaries of being part of ‘London Plan’ to topple his govt • Two more jail officials detained in hunt for ex-PM’s facilitators ISLAMABAD / RAWALPINDI: Having distanced himself from the former spy chief after news of his court martial became public, PTI founder Imran Khan on Thursday welcomed the process of ‘internal accountability’ initiated by the military, and called for across-the-board action. He was speaking to reporters at Adiala jail after the hearing of a £190 million corruption case. Commenting on a statement by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — alluding to the alleged involvement of retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed in the May 9 protests following his arrest — the former PM said that “if Faiz Hameed was involved, it should be investigated”. Hameed was head of the premier Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency during Mr Khan’s term in office. In a separate development, two more officials of the Punjab Prisons Department were taken into custody by law enforcement agencies for investigation as the probe to find alleged facilitators of incarcerated PTI founder in prison moved ahead. Speaking to reporters, Mr Khan pointed out that the May 9 protests started after his illegal arrest on the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), adding that this also needed to be probed, as those who ordered his arrest were responsible for the violent protests. He said that the arsonists could be identified with the help of the CCTV footage and added that the footage would exonerate him of all charges. The PTI leader also alleged that the May 9 incidents were also part of the ‘London Plan’, supposedly devised to topple his regime, and accused the chief justice of Pakistan, the IHC chief justice, and the chief election commissioner of being part of the plot. He pointed out that the former Rawalpindi commissioner also “exposed” rigging in the Feb 8 elections. It should be noted, however, that at the time of Mr Khan’s ouster, Umar Atta Bandial was the chief justice of Pakistan, while Justice Athar Minallah had not been elevated to the Supreme Court and was still heading the Islamabad High Court. Although some interpreted the ex-PM’s remarks on Thursday as a reference to the incumbents — Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and IHC CJ Aamer Farooq — both were not in office in April 2022, when Mr Khan’s government was sent home following a vote of no-confidence in the National Assembly. The ex-PM claimed that former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa had hatched a conspiracy against the PTI government for his extension. He said that Gen Bajwa removed Gen Faiz Hameed from the post of the ISI chief on the demand of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif and this development had created a rift between the office of the prime minister and the army chief. Mr Khan said that he wanted Gen Faiz to retain his position because of his contacts with the Taliban regime. Adiala probe Following the detention of a former deputy superintendent on Wednesday for acting as a ‘messenger’ for the incarcerated PTI leader, two more officials were taken into custody by law enforcement agencies for investigation. One of them is a retired deputy superintendent and another is serving as an assistant at the office of the Deputy Inspector General of Prison (Rawalpindi Region). According to sources, the exact role of the assistant cannot be ascertained at this point; however, two orderlies and three warders have also been made part of the investigation. The sources said that the two orderlies and three warders had been working under the former deputy superintendent during his posting at the Adiala jail. Muhammad Akram had been deta­ined from his residence on Wednesday. The Punjab home department had removed Mr Akram, deputy superintendent (executive) of Central Jail Adiala from his post and directed him to report to the Inspectorate of Prison Punjab, Lahore in June this year. However, he had been residing with his family in the Police Colony of the Adiala jail. On the other hand, surveillance of the barracks where the PTI founder had been incarcerated was further tightened and additional staff was also deployed. Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The woman who was found bound and gagged on a roadside in the capital on Wednesday and claimed to be a foreign national turned out to be a permanent resident of Rawalpindi. Police officers told Dawn that a special committee had been formed under the supervision of a senior superintendent of police (SSP), comprising the subdivisional police officer, station house officers of Aabpara and women police stations and an official from the Special Sexual Offence Investigation Unit after the investigators remained clueless to establish the nationality of the woman who claimed to be from Belgium.      The committee took the woman to the Nadra headquarters for identification as no travel record was available with the FIA and the embassy. Through her facial recognition and fingerprint impression, the woman was identified as a Pakistani national and a permanent resident of Rawalpindi. Earlier, medico-legal examination of the woman was conducted at Polyclinic to establish her allegation that she was raped. She was then shifted to the Women Police Station and kept under protective custody there. The woman is still not ready to give a statement to the police which are working to ascertain the motive behind her claim to be a foreign national and under which circumstances she was left on the roadside, the officers added. The woman was found bound and gagged on a roadside at G-6/1-3. After getting information, a police team reached the spot and shifted her to a hospital. She had introduced herself as a Belgian national and alleged that she had been living with a man who repeatedly raped her. The woman was unable to produce any identity document as she had no belongings with her. Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Sec­retariat, under the administrative reforms’ agenda, has carried out downsizing in the Secretariat and abolished 220 posts from Grade 1 to 19. According to a press release issued on Thursday, NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq ordered wide-ranging administrative reforms in the NA Secretariat. While taking cognizance of austerity measures, the speaker abolished 220 non-essential posts of Grade 1 to 19, which would save the national exchequer more than Rs563 million annually, the press release said. It said that two of the three pha­ses of administrative reforms have been implemented successfully. In the first phase, 90 non-essential posts of various grades in the National Assembly Secretariat were abolished which saved Rs250.52 million annually. In the second phase, abolishing of 130 non-essential posts from Grade 1 to 19 has resulted in saving more than Rs30.75 million. Implementation of the two phases resulted in an annual saving of more than Rs560m, while additional savings of Rs400m will be done in the third phase. A decision for downsizing was approved at a meeting of the Finance Committee held under the chairmanship of the speaker. The decisions app­roved at the finance committee meeting include: implementation of the austerity plan, rationalising needs and requirements of the National Assembly Secre­tariat, improvement in the procedure of determination, elimination, appointments and promotions, ensuring transparency and accountability. The finance committee has also stopped further recruitment in the NA Secretariat unless decided otherwise, while a sub-committee has also been formed to review the NAS Employees Act, 2018, to make it more compatible with Civil Servants Act, 1973. The committee will propose amendments to National Assembly Employees Act, 2018, with the purpose to determine the strength of staff according to the needs of the NAS and to improve the system of promotions and appointments.

  "description": "As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods. “I was happy to hear I was getting married… I thought my life would become easier,” Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life. “But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.” Pakistan’s high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity.      The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage. Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests. “This has led to a new trend of ‘monsoon brides’,” said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage. “Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.” Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.    In this photograph taken on Aug 4, 2024 Dildar Ali Sheikh (3R) sits beside his eldest daughter Mehtab (2R), who was to marry underage during monsoons, as they pose for a photo with their family at NGO Sujag Sansar’s office in Johi, Dadu district of Sindh — AFP  In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon — 15 of them in May and June this year. “Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,” said village elder Mai Hajani, 65. “They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done”. Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money. Shamila’s mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave Rs200,000 ($720) to the young bride’s parents — a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day. ‘I thought I would get lipstick’    In this photograph taken on Aug 3, 2024 Najma Ali, a monsoon bride who was married underage, prepares flatbread outside her hut at Khan Muhammad Mallah village in Main Nara Valley, Dadu district — AFP  Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws. “My husband gave my parents Rs250,000 for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,” she said. “I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,” she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby. “Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.” Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water — its stench overwhelms the area. “We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,” said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma’s mother.    In this photograph taken on Aug 3, 2024 Hakim Zaadi (C), village matron and mother of Najma Ali (R), a monsoon bride who was married underage, distributes flatbread to children outside her hut at Khan Muhammad Mallah village in Main Nara Valley, Dadu district— AFP  “They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,” she added. “The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.” - ‘I want to study’ Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December. The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced. Unicef has reported “significant strides” in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk. “We would expect to see an 18 per cent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,” it said in a report after the 2022 floods. Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.    In this photograph taken on Aug 4, 2024 Mehtab learns to sew at NGO Sujag Sansar’s office in Johi, Dadu district — AFP  “When I was there, I thought to myself ‘we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities’,” the daily wage labourer told AFP. Mehtab was just 10 years old. “The night I decided to get her married, I couldn’t sleep,” said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married. An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education. But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive. “I have told my father I want to study,” she said. “I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don’t want this for myself.”  Header image: In this photograph taken on Aug 4, 2024 social workers at NGO Sujag Sansar take part in a theatre practice ahead of their performance, intending to create awareness on dangers of child-marriages at the NGO office in Johi, Dadu district of Sindh province. — AFP "

  "description": "• Cabinet gives its assent to Rs1.45m per home • Approves formation of Sindh power regulatory authority • Rs200m sanctioned for rectification of Jamila Pumping Station                      KARACHI: The Sindh Cabinet has approved Rs10.065 billion as grant-in-aid for the construction of 80-square-yard houses for 6,932 people whose homes along the Gujjar, Orangi and Mahmoodabad nullahs were demolished.   The provincial government had earlier allotted a 258 acres in Taiser Town Scheme 45, Malir Development Authority, for the development of a housing scheme for the affectees of the three major storm water drains of the city.   On Thursday, the cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and attended among others by provincial ministers, also directed the local government department to forward the revised PC-1 of Rs4,621.494 million for internal development of the area, including essential infrastructure, roads, water supply, sewerage, storm-water drainage, power supply, and mosque, to the planning and development department for consideration and approval from the competent forum.   The cabinet was informed that the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) had evaluated the per-house cost at Rs1,450,000.   In addition to this, the PEC also advised providing funds for construction to the affectees as per the schedule: Rs500,000 on commencement of work; Rs500,000 on completion of masonry work up to the roof level; Rs450,000 on completion of the grey structure for finishing work.   The cabinet accorded principal approval of the tentative amount for the remaining affectees for Rs1,450,000 per house of 80-sq yard. However, the final list will be provided by the focal person through a verification process as directed by the Supreme Court.   The commissioner was directed to disburse the amount as per the schedule advised by PEC.   The cabinet was told that Jamila Sewerage Pumping Station was constructed in 1880, catering limited population at that time. However, now the pumping station takes a heavy load of sewerage coming from the old city area and two-thirds of Lyari Town taking up a load of up to 20 million gallons per day (MGD).  It was informed that the infrastructure uplift for pumping out 35 MGD was required for the smooth functioning of the pumping station. The entire infrastructure including Civil and Mechanical Works along with the Electrical equipment are to be constructed afresh to provide long-term relief to the residents of Old City Area and Lyari Town.   The cabinet after discussion approved Rs200m for emergency rectification works of Jamila Pumping Station.  Hub Canal  The cabinet was told that the Karachi water board is going to undertake rehabilitation of the existing Hub Canal and construction of a new canal of 100 MGD parallel to the existing one for Rs9.80 billion and Rs2.92bn, respectively, through a government-to-government arrangement (KWSB and a federal government construction company).  The CM said that the project was very important to provide water to the city and required immediate implementation without any bottlenecks and hindrances.  The cabinet was told that the fastest mode of execution could be undertaken by obtaining a “grant-in-aid” from the provincial government.   The chief minister said that he would provide a grant-in-aid of Rs12.72bn to the KWSC if the project was completed within a year, that is, by Sept 2025.   Electric authority  The cabinet under the Sindh Regulation of Electric Power Services Act, (SREPS) 2023 approved to establish an authority known as “The Sindh Electric Power Regulatory Authority (SEPRA),” which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal.  The authority shall comprise a chairman and three members, including a Technical & Development Member, a Member of Legal and Corporate and a Member of Finance and Policy.  The CM also approved Rs197.916m for the SEPRA for 2024-25 and directed Energy Minister Nasir Shah to appoint the chairman and the members as per law.  Land for railway line  The cabinet was informed that Pakistan Railways had asked for an allotment of 1381.34 acres of land in Mirpurkhas Division to lay a 105-km railway line from Islamkot - Thar Coal Field – to Chhor and 30 acres in Karachi Division: 9-km from Bin Qasim to Port Qasim.  The land includes 720 acres in Umerkot and 661.34 acres in Tharparkar and 30 acres in Ibrahim Hyderi.  The railway line to be laid from Thar Coal Field to Chhor and Bin Qasim to Port Qasim would be used to transport coal from Thar Coal Field to the upcountry and to the power projects.  The CM directed the energy minister to coordinate with Pakistan Railways so that work on the project could be started at the earliest.  Solar Parks  The cabinet was told that the energy department was executing the “Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP)” with the financial and technical support of the World Bank. Under the project, three solar power parks having a capacity of 320 MW are being established in three districts.  The cabinet approved the allotment of 1,462 acres of land, including 250 acres for a 50 MW solar park at Manjhand, Jamshoro, 612 acres for a 120 MW solar park in Deh Halkani / Murad Band, district West Karachi and 600 acres for a 150 MW solar park in Deh Mitha Ghar, district Malir.  The energy department requested the cabinet for exemption of the duty. However, the CM refused to exempt it, saying that every department and person must pay taxes.  Besides, the cabinet also allotted 40 acres at Tapa Landhi, district Korangi for the establishment of Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (SICVD). Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "description": "TOB TEK SINGH: Faisalabad police claim to have recovered a Sikh woman and her minor son, who had allegedly been kept in illegal confinement by two brothers in their house in D-Type Colony at Faisalabad for the last nine months, while the woman was also repeatedly raped by the suspects during that period.     Punjab Minister for Minority Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, along with Faisalabad City Police Officer Kamran Adil, told a press conference held at the Police Lines, Faisalabad, on Thursday that the woman ‘MK’ (40), a mother of five, met the suspect, ‘KS’ of Faisalabad’s Suhailabad locality six years ago at the house of her friend at Nankana Sahib. The police said that in December 2023, ‘MK’ asked the suspect to drop her minor son at her sister’s house at Faisalabad.  However, instead of handing over the child to MK’s sister, the suspect allegedly took the child hostage to “blackmail” her.    Police say victim was also raped and tortured by suspects   When ‘MK’ visited ‘KS’ to get back her son, the suspect allegedly also made her hostage and kept the mother and her minor son in illegal confinement for nine months. During this period, the suspect and his brother also allegedly raped the woman repeatedly and subjected her to torture, the police said. After the victim’s family brought the matter to the notice of the Faisalabad CPO, he formed a team headed by SSP (investigation) Abdul Wahab and consisting of Gender Based Violence Unit in charge ASP Zainab Khalid, to recover the woman and the child. The police said the police team conducted a raid on the suspects’ house and recovered the mother and her son on Aug 14. The minister praised the police’s role in recovery of the woman and her son and assured that justice would be served and a legal action would be taken against the suspects. Mr Arora said that negative propaganda is often made through hired bloggers regarding minority rights in Pakistan, whereas the Constitution provides all rights to minorities, and the Punjab government is committed to safeguarding these rights. Commending the role of the media, he said that the media always lends support to religious minorities in the country. Published in Dawn, August 16th, 2024 "

  "content": "    Security forces have killed three terrorists during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) area of Razmak, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Friday.  \"On 16 August 2024, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Razmak, District North Waziristan, on the reported presence of Khwarij,' the army's media wing said in a statement.  \"During the conduct of the operation, intense fire exchange took place between the troops and khwarij, as a result of which, three Khwarij of Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell, while one Kharji got injured.\"  Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces as well as the targeted killings of innocent civilians, it added.  The statement further said that the process of sanitisation in the area is underway to eliminate any other terrorists found in the locale as security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of \"khawarij\" and terrorism from the country. A day earlier, seven terrorists were killed and five others wounded in an IBO conducted in the KP district of Kurram.  In another action carried out last week by the security forces in South Waziristan, four soldiers embraced martyrdom while six terrorists were killed during the exchange of gunfire.  Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents were reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.  According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

During the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Power's meeting, MNA Afridi raised an objection over the dressing of a woman. He then received criticism from other members and attendees present at the session. Responding to Afridi, Senator Rehman said that he should apologise for his behaviour. “This behaviour is reprehensible and falls under the line of harassment.  The PTI should make its MNA apologise.\" She, while addressing Afridi directly, said: “ No one has the right to comment over a woman’s attire. Don’t make a patriarchal society, who made you a policeman of clothes?” Additionally, the information minister also condemned the act of the PTI lawmaker, saying: “Harassing women is not acceptable in any condition. The Tehreek-e-Insaf has become tehreek-e-na-insaf [unjust movement] for women.” “Women face so many difficulties in our society. The PTI should take action against Iqbal Afridi,” he said, adding, “Real justice is that the party membership of Iqbal Afridi should be suspended.” He further added: “This is the PTI’s fascism, which is coming out openly.” Parallel to this, the Sindh government spokesperson also said: “There was nothing inappropriate in the clothes of the woman that should have been objected to. Women have full freedom in our society.”   Referring to the PTI MNA, he added: “Iqbal Afridi should be careful of his gaze, his objection over the woman’s clothing does not make sense.” He added, “Iqbal Afridi should apologise to the woman for his act.”"

  "content": "    Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif has attributed the skyrocketing cost of living to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that it was the Imran Khan-led regime that brought the International Monetary Fund (IMF) back to the country.  Addressing a press conference flanked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Lahore on Friday, the three-time prime minister said that the issue of price hike commenced in the PTI government, adding that he knows about the pain the people of Pakistan are going through. The PML-N's top leader said he recalls the time in 2017 when there was no price hike issue with people living an easy and comfortable life, adding that he became premier in 2013, his government worked on the economy, making it one of the world's best-performing economies.    At that time, the world praised the country for its emerging economy, as the PML-N-led government took the US dollar to Rs95, Nawaz said. \"However, the government had to keep the greenback pegged at Rs104 for the next four years owing to exports and some other issues.\" The greenback would have been pegged at Rs104 if he had stayed in power, he added. Earlier, he started his speech by saying that he was evicted from the PM Office because he did not draw a salary from his son, a matter which he called \"a joke\". \"Was this a justifiable reason for de-seating an incumbent prime minister?\" he asked. The PML-N government, he also said, is not behind the current price hike, adding that the world reacted to Pakistan's growth, saying the country has rid itself of the IMF grip. \"Who brought the IMF back to Pakistan is the same person [Imran Khan] who is currently speaking from jail \" The PML-N top leader said that he put an end to the load-shedding before the termination of his five-year term. \"We surmounted the power crisis in three years,\" he said, adding that the power bill of a common man was Rs1,600 in 2017 which has now surged to Rs18,000. He added that the bank's interest rate was around 5% during his tenure however, it went up to 22% under the PTI's rule. The N League supremo, patting the shoulder of Maryam Nawaz, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. The Punjab government has prepared a relief package by cutting the power tariff by Rs14 per unit for people consuming up to 500 units of electricity, Nawaz said. \"The relief will be given in the bills of August and September. \" He added that the provincial government had slashed its development fund to provide the relief in utility bills. Reacting to the PML-N leader's presser, PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the former premier once again tried to mislead the public.  Brushing aside Nawaz's assertion regarding the rupee value, the PTI leader said that Nawaz kept the dollar at Rs104 not by enhancing exports and used $30 billion of the nation to maintain this \"artificial exchange rate\".    He added that this measure by Nawaz led to a severe economic crisis in 2017 and 2018. This crunch, he said, was taken care of by the Imran Khan-led government that took the economy back to 6% growth. Azhar further stated that the power unit was at Rs16 during the PTI's tenure but the per unit price of electricity soared to Rs60 in the PML-N government."

As the Met Office announced the onset of monsoon winds in Sindh on Friday, Sarfaraz stated that these winds may \"affect the city (Karachi) from tomorrow\". According to PMD, the monsoon spell in the country is expected to persist until August 25 with Karachi, Ghotki, Mirpurkhas, Umarkot, Sanghar, Thatta and Sukkur, and other cities of Sindh forecasted to experience rainfall with thunder until August 19. Meanwhile, the PMD's forecast also shows that Gujranwala, Hafizabad and Chiniot, may be hit with heavy rain, under which the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned major cities of Punjab regarding urban flooding. Meanwhile, the NDMA has taken prompt action after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the authority to ensure the safety of tourists and locals in flood-affected areas. In its report to the premier, it mentioned placing urgent measures to safeguard foreign tourists in flash flood-hit Gilgit-Baltistan and confirmed the safety of two Italians and one Argentinian tourist in the region. According to the report, the tourists in GB's Astore area are currently at a secure location and away from the affected area. Additionally, efforts to restore the Feena Bridge, which sustained significant damage due to the floods, are currently underway. The PM said it must be ensured that tourists and local people do not face any kind of problem. Earlier, he issued instructions to the NDMA, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in the provinces and other concerned agencies to be on high alert during the new monsoon spell. The premier said he will be monitoring the expected severe monsoon spell from the dashboard till August 25 and emphasised that the evacuation of people in emergency situation, preparation of drainage must be ensured."

  "description": "A representational image showing internet cables.   Reuters/FileMillions across country continue to face trouble accessing internet.Govt attributes issue to purported testing of internet firewall.Court would issue orders for disruptions, says LHC judge.    <p...",
  "content": "  LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday expressed displeasure over the state counsel's non-seriousness and \"lack of knowledge\" on the matter of the nationwide internet service disruptions that have been a burning issue in the country for weeks. Justice Ahmad of the LHC took up a petition, seeking the immediate restoration of internet access across the country, filed by a citizen named Noman Sarwar against the \"nationwide internet shutdown\".  Millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The government has attributed the issue to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. The federal government, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), and other entities were nominated as respondents in the case. At the outset of the hearing, the federal government's prosecutor Rana Noman sought time from the court to present a detailed report on internet disruption.  The court had directed the state counsel to take instructions from the relevant authorities and appear before the court today. Taking the public official to task at his response, Justice Ahmed replied that it was a matter of public interest and the prosecutor’s \"seriousness\" in it reflected through his \"lack of knowledge\".  Later, the court reserved its verdict, with the LHC judge saying that the court would issue appropriate orders for the internet disruptions was a matter of public interest.  According to the petition, the internet and social media applications were shut down in the country without the authorities giving any notice or reason. “Businesses and every sphere of life are being affected because of the internet’s closure. Shutting down the internet is also a violation of fundamental rights,” the plea said. The plea, filed in the LHC, also demanded revocation of the federal government's \"decision\" to shut down the internet. It may be noted that users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja on Thursday said that a firewall was a cybersecurity measure \"that every country in the world takes\". “An issue is created in the media and masses [out of nothing],” she said responding to a query about testing of an internet firewall after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication.  The minister said earlier a web management system was in place and currently its upgradation was happening to cope with cybersecurity threats. “Look at the cybersecurity attacks being carried out on the country and the world as well. With the evolution of cybersecurity threats, states need to have a better capability to ensure that the threats are [well] responded to,” she said. On the matter of internet slowdown, she said she had requested the internet service providers and the PTA to provide data related to traffic over the last two weeks. “Once the data comes, we will be in a better position to say something,” she said. Shaza clarified that the government was not in favour of the internet slowdown, rather it was working to upgrade it to 5G. Meanwhile, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) has blamed the phenomenon on increased security and surveillance whose adverse repercussions might lead to severe economic repercussions. Elaborating on the prevailing issue, the WISPAP chairman revealed that internet speeds witnessed around 30% to 40% reduction which has had a devastating effect on businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity. Highlighting the adverse effects of internet-related issues on online and electronic-related businesses, the chairman warned that these sectors, an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy, are now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival\"."

  "content": "PESHAWAR: At least five people, including two police personnel, have been injured in an explosion at the Warsak Road in the Pir Bala area, police told Geo News on Friday. According to the police, the target of the blast was a police vehicle. Warsak Road Superintendent of Police (SP) Arshad Khan said that the police vehicle has been damaged in the wake of the \"remote-controlled\" blast. \"Explosives were planted in a cement block,\" said the policeman, adding that the explosives used in the remote controlled blast weighed five kilograms. The five people injured in the explosion have shifted to the hospital, Rescue 1122 officials told Geo News. The spokesperson of Lady Reading Hospital Muhammad Asim said that five injured were brought to the facility which include two policemen and three civilians. The condition of the injured, the spokesperson added, is out of danger and they are being provided medical aid. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has sought a report on the blast, directing authorities to provide best medical aid to the injured. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 with most terror incidents reported in the provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Omar Ayub on Thursday rejected Hammad Azhar’s resignation as the Punjab president; however, the latter said he was \"firm\" on his decision.  “Hammad Azhar you have worked tirelessly for the party and PM (sic) Imran Khan sahib. Resignation not accepted,” Ayub wrote on X. In response to the PTI secretary general’s remark, Azhar said he could not work under such circumstances where he had all the responsibility but no authority.  “I am humbled by your confidence in me. But it is my firm decision to not continue under the circumstances where I have zero authority but complete responsibility,” he said. Moreover, he said restrictions on his movements too were the reasons behind his decision. A day earlier, Azhar stepped down as the president of the party's Punjab chapter, citing lack of access to PTI founder Imran Khan and restrictions on his movements as the reasons behind his decision.  \"Unfortunately I do not have access to Imran Khan. I did not hold a press conference nor did any deal as my movement is very restricted and I cannot go to Adiala [jail],\" Azhar wrote on X. The Imran's loyalist expressed various grievances, one of them was not consulting him in the decisions taken within the PTI's Punjab organisation, as he said \"most of these decisions were based on lobbying\" instead of merit. Moreover, he said limited access and provision of one-sided information to the PTI founder also concerned him. Azhar cited Chaudhry Asghar's removal as PTI's Lahore president as one example of \"lobbying\", saying that the lobbyists wanted to replace Asghar and they succeeded today and got the desired directives from the jailed PTI founder by giving him the \"wrong facts\". The former minister also mentioned that the PTI founder was not being informed about the troubles of PTI members in various other regions. \"In this situation, it is not possible for me or during my presidency of Punjab to violate the merit and denotify the people who are performing and making sacrifices just because their voices cannot reach Khan sahab,\" he said.  The PTI leader recalled the first time he had resigned \"for the same reason that it is not possible for anyone to run the affairs without access to the party leaders\".  He further stated that those who have vested interests take advantage of the lack of communication with PTI founder. Azhar said that the major organisational responsibility should be vested only in those who have access to the party leader to convey complete facts to him.  \"Therefore, I am leaving the charge of the Punjab Presidency from today. I was a worker of Imran Khan and will remain so God willing,\" he concluded."

  "content": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Communication and Works Shakeel Ahmad Khan resigned from his post while levelling allegations of corruption and bad governance against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed provincial government. Shakeel said that he had sent his resignation to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. The development came days after incarcerated PTI founder Iman Khan, in a stern message from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, warned members of his party’s government in KP that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. In line with the directions of Khan, the PTI constituted a three-member committee to monitor corruption and governance in KP, where the party formed government after the February 2024 general elections. It should be noted that Khan decided to constitute the committee after provincial minister Shakeel, during a meeting with him in jail, complained about embezzlement in various departments of KP. Sources privy to the matter said that Shakeel alleged that he was unable to perform his duties properly due to the corruption and bad governance in the province. He also alleged that CM Gandapur’s interference in his department was affecting his performance.  The minister alleged that the KP CM was acting on someone else’s directions, adding that the provincial government was compromising on principals and promises made to the public. The KP government has backtracked from its principled position, he alleged, adding that bad governance and corruption have destroyed the party's manifesto. On the other hand, CM Gandapur clarified that the written resignation of Shakeel has not been received yet.  “On the recommendation of the committee, a summary seeking to de-notify the minister has already been sent [to the governor],\" he said, adding that he had signed the summary and sent it to the governor a day earlier."

  "content": "    Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday said former chief of army staff General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa had threatened to impose martial law in the country as he sought an extension in his term for the second time in November 2022.   The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior leader said this in response to a statement by Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmed Khan who told the media that Bajwa, who is his close friend, did not seek an extension. A day earlier, the PA speaker, who also belongs to PML-N, recalled his meeting with the former serviceman in the US embassy where Bajwa denied rumours that he wanted an extension.  He indicated that it was possible that some details might have slipped Khawaja Asif's mind. Speaking on Geo News show 'Capital Talk', Asif said that he has a sound memory. \"It is quite possible that I may not be able to recall things of near past. But, I absolutely retain all past memories,\" he stressed. \"General Bajwa had said in a sitting that he would impose martial law in the country,\" the defence minister asserted. Asif said that he and Malik Ahmed are speaking about separate situations, adding that there is no difference between what both of them are saying. General (retd) Bajwa, he remarked, had been demanding an extension of six months to one year \"as part of a temporary arrangement\" to break a deadlock.  Speaking on Geo News show Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath today, the Punjab assembly speaker reiterated that Gen (retd) Bajwa without mincing his words stated during his official US trip that he would not seek extension in his term.   \"I am an old soldier and an old soldier fades away,\" Malik Ahmed recalled the quote of the former army chief, saying that Gen (retd) on many occasions reiterated the same stance that he was not seeking an extension.  Moreover, he said Bajwa believed that the General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and General Asim Munir should be appointed to the top posts of army chief and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Meanwhile, Asif in today's show, also reiterated his claim that Bajwa brought Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan into power and it was he who was calling the shots, recalling that Khan would shower praise on the former army chief during official events.  The defence minister said that both Bajwa and General (retd) Faiz Hamid have a close relationship, saying the former wanted the latter to succeed him as army chief.  Earlier this week, the military's media wing announced that Gen (retd) Faiz — former DG ISI —  has been taken into custody over allegations of land grabbing and abuse of power. "

  "content": "At least three terrorists were killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Razmak area in District North Waziristan, where security forces launched an intelligence-based operation on the reported presence of militants, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Friday. \"On 16 August 2024, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Razmak, District North Waziristan, on the reported presence of Khwarij,' the army's media wing said in a statement. \"During the conduct of the operation, intense fire exchange took place between the troops and khwarij, as a result of which, three Khwarij of Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell, while one Kharji got injured.\" Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces as well as the targeted killings of innocent civilians, it added. The statement further said that the process of sanitisation in the area is underway to eliminate any other terrorists found in the locale as security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of \"khawarij\" and terrorism from the country. A day earlier, seven terrorists were killed and five others wounded in an IBO conducted in the KP district of Kurram. In another action carried out last week by the security forces in South Waziristan, four soldiers embraced martyrdom while six terrorists were killed during the exchange of gunfire.

  "content": "Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif has announced that the Punjab government decided to give relief in electricity bills for consumers using up to 500 units in August and September.  Addressing a press conference flanked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Lahore on Friday, he acclaimed the provincial chief executive for providing a relief package, saying the provincial government had slashed the development fund to give Rs14 per unit cut in power bills.  The PML-N's top leader said he recalls the time in 2017 when there was no price hike issue with people living an easy and comfortable life, adding that he became premier in 2013, his government worked on the economy, making it one of the world's best-performing economies.   At that time, the world praised the country for its emerging economy, as the PML-N-led government took the US dollar to Rs95, Nawaz said. \"However, the government had to keep the greenback pegged at Rs104 for the next four years owing to exports and some other issues.\" The greenback would have been pegged at Rs104 if he had stayed in power, he added. Earlier, he started his speech by saying that he was evicted from the PM Office because he did not draw a salary from his son, a matter which he called \"a joke\". \"Was this a justifiable reason for de-seating an incumbent prime minister?\" he asked. The PML-N government, he also said, is not behind the current price hike, adding that the world reacted to Pakistan's growth, saying the country has rid itself of the IMF grip. \"Who brought the IMF back to Pakistan is the same person [Imran Khan] who is currently speaking from jail \" The PML-N top leader said that he put an end to the load-shedding before the termination of his five-year term. \"We surmounted the power crisis in three years,\" he said, adding that the power bill of a common man was Rs1,600 in 2017 which has now surged to Rs18,000. He added that the bank's interest rate was around 5% during his tenure however, it went up to 22% under the PTI's rule. The N League supremo, patting the shoulder of Maryam Nawaz, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. Reacting to the PML-N leader's presser, PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the former premier once again tried to mislead the public.  Brushing aside Nawaz's assertion regarding the rupee value, the PTI leader said that Nawaz kept the dollar at Rs104 not by enhancing exports and used $30 billion of the nation to maintain this \"artificial exchange rate\".    He added that this measure by Nawaz led to a severe economic crisis in 2017 and 2018. This crunch, he said, was taken care of by the Imran Khan-led government that took the economy back to 6% growth. Azhar further stated that the power unit was at Rs16 during the PTI's tenure but the per unit price of electricity soared to Rs60 in the PML-N government."

  "content": "KARACHI: The port city is likely to get drenched by heavy rain with a possibility of urban flooding in Karachi's slum areas over the weekend, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz warned on Friday. Sarfaraz, commenting on the expected spell, said that the monsoon winds, which entered Sindh today, are likely to \"affect the city (Karachi) from tomorrow\". PMD predicted that the monsoon period will last until August 25, with several cities in Sindh, including Karachi, Ghotki, Mirpurkhas, Umarkot, Sanghar, Thatta Sukkur, and more expected to experience thunderstorms and rainfall until August 19. Additionally, the Met Office forecast indicates the possibility of heavy rain in Gujranwala, Hafizabad and Chiniot, prompting the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to caution major cities of Punjab for potential urban flooding. Meanwhile, the NDMA has taken prompt action after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the authority to ensure the safety of tourists and locals in flood-affected areas. In its report to the premier, it mentioned placing urgent measures to safeguard foreign tourists in flash flood-hit Gilgit-Baltistan and confirmed the safety of two Italians and one Argentinian tourist in the region. According to the report, the tourists in GB's Astore area are currently at a secure location and away from the affected area. Additionally, efforts to restore the Feena Bridge, which sustained significant damage due to the floods, are currently underway. The PM said it must be ensured that tourists and local people do not face any kind of problem. Earlier, he issued instructions to the NDMA, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in the provinces and other concerned agencies to be on high alert during the new monsoon spell. The premier said he will be monitoring the expected severe monsoon spell from the dashboard till August 25 and emphasised that the evacuation of people in emergency situation, preparation of drainage must be ensured."

  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday rebuked the state counsel for his non-seriousness and \"lack of knowledge\" on the matter of the nationwide internet service disruptions that have been a burning issue in the country for weeks. Justice Ahmad of the LHC took up a petition, seeking the immediate restoration of internet access across the country, filed by a citizen named Noman Sarwar against the \"nationwide internet shutdown\".  Millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The government has attributed the issue to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. The federal government, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), and other entities were nominated as respondents in the case. At the outset of the hearing, the federal government's prosecutor Rana Noman sought time from the court to present a detailed report on internet disruption. The court had directed the state counsel to take instructions from the relevant authorities and appear before the court today. Taking the public official to task at his response, Justice Ahmed replied that it was a matter of public interest and the prosecutor’s \"seriousness\" in it reflected through his \"lack of knowledge\". Later, the court reserved its verdict, with the LHC judge saying that the court would issue appropriate orders for the internet disruptions was a matter of public interest. According to the petition, the internet and social media applications were shut down in the country without the authorities giving any notice or reason. “Businesses and every sphere of life are being affected because of the internet’s closure. Shutting down the internet is also a violation of fundamental rights,” the plea said. The plea, filed in the LHC, also demanded revocation of the federal government's \"decision\" to shut down the internet. It may be noted that users of the widely used messaging application WhatsApp in Pakistan have also reported frustratingly long delays and failures when uploading and downloading content of all types. Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja on Thursday said that a firewall was a cybersecurity measure \"that every country in the world takes\". “An issue is created in the media and masses [out of nothing],” she said responding to a query about testing of an internet firewall after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication.  The minister said earlier a web management system was in place and currently its upgradation was happening to cope with cybersecurity threats. “Look at the cybersecurity attacks being carried out on the country and the world as well. With the evolution of cybersecurity threats, states need to have a better capability to ensure that the threats are [well] responded to,” she said. On the matter of internet slowdown, she said she had requested the internet service providers and the PTA to provide data related to traffic over the last two weeks. “Once the data comes, we will be in a better position to say something,” she said. Shaza clarified that the government was not in favour of the internet slowdown, rather it was working to upgrade it to 5G. Meanwhile, the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) has blamed the phenomenon on increased security and surveillance whose adverse repercussions might lead to severe economic repercussions. Elaborating on the prevailing issue, the WISPAP chairman revealed that internet speeds witnessed around 30% to 40% reduction which has had a devastating effect on businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity. Highlighting the adverse effects of internet-related issues on online and electronic-related businesses, the chairman warned that these sectors, an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy, are now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival\"."

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Two cops and three others were injured after an explosion targeted a police vehicle at the Warsak Road in Pir Bala on Friday, Geo News reported citing the police. The target of the blast was the police vehicle, said the law enforcement officials. The vehicle, according to Warsak Road Superintendent of Police (SP) Arshad Khan, was damaged in the wake of the \"remote-controlled\" blast. \"Explosives were planted in a cement block,\" said the policeman, adding that the explosives used in the remote controlled blast weighed five kilograms. The five people injured in the explosion have shifted to the hospital, Rescue 1122 officials told Geo News. The spokesperson of Lady Reading Hospital Muhammad Asim said that five injured were brought to the facility which include two policemen and three civilians. The condition of the injured, the spokesperson added, is out of danger and they are being provided medical aid. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has sought a report on the blast, directing authorities to provide best medical aid to the injured. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 with most terror incidents reported in the provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Omar Ayub on Thursday turned down Hammad Azhar’s resignation after the latter stepped down as the party's Punjab president.  “Hammad Azhar you have worked tirelessly for the party and PM (sic) Imran Khan sahib. Resignation not accepted,” Ayub wrote on X. Replying to Ayub, PTI leader said he was firm on his decision as he could not work with “zero authority”. “I am humbled by your confidence in me. But it is my firm decision to not continue under the circumstances where I have zero authority but complete responsibility,” he said. Moreover, he said restrictions on his movements too were the reasons behind his decision. A day earlier, Azhar stepped down as the president of the party's Punjab chapter, citing lack of access to PTI founder Imran Khan and restrictions on his movements as the reasons behind his decision.  \"Unfortunately I do not have access to Imran Khan. I did not hold a press conference nor did any deal as my movement is very restricted and I cannot go to Adiala [jail],\" Azhar wrote on X. The Imran's loyalist expressed various grievances, one of them was not consulting him in the decisions taken within the PTI's Punjab organisation, as he said \"most of these decisions were based on lobbying\" instead of merit. Moreover, he said limited access and provision of one-sided information to the PTI founder also concerned him. Azhar cited Chaudhry Asghar's removal as PTI's Lahore president as one example of \"lobbying\", saying that the lobbyists wanted to replace Asghar and they succeeded today and got the desired directives from the jailed PTI founder by giving him the \"wrong facts\". The former minister also mentioned that the PTI founder was not being informed about the troubles of PTI members in various other regions. \"In this situation, it is not possible for me or during my presidency of Punjab to violate the merit and denotify the people who are performing and making sacrifices just because their voices cannot reach Khan sahab,\" he said. The PTI leader recalled the first time he had resigned \"for the same reason that it is not possible for anyone to run the affairs without access to the party leaders\". He further stated that those who have vested interests take advantage of the lack of communication with PTI founder. Azhar said that the major organisational responsibility should be vested only in those who have access to the party leader to convey complete facts to him. \"Therefore, I am leaving the charge of the Punjab Presidency from today. I was a worker of Imran Khan and will remain so God willing,\" he concluded."

  "content": "In an unexpected development, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Communication and Works Shakeel Ahmad Khan stepped down from his post while levelling allegations of corruption and bad governance against the PTI-backed provincial government. Shakeel said that he had sent his resignation to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. The development came days after incarcerated PTI founder Iman Khan, in a stern message from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, warned members of his party’s government in KP that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. In line with the directions of Khan, the PTI constituted a three-member committee to monitor corruption and governance in KP, where the party formed government after the February 2024 general elections. It should be noted that Khan decided to constitute the committee after provincial minister Shakeel, during a meeting with him in jail, complained about embezzlement in various departments of KP. Sources privy to the matter said that Shakeel alleged that he was unable to perform his duties properly due to the corruption and bad governance in the province. He also alleged that CM Gandapur’s interference in his department was affecting his performance. The minister alleged that the KP CM was acting on someone else’s directions, adding that the provincial government was compromising on principales and promises made to the public. The KP government has backtracked from its principled position, he alleged, adding that bad governance and corruption have destroyed the party's manifesto. On the other hand, KP CM Gandapur clarified that the written resignation of Shakeel has not been received yet.  “On the recommendation of the committee, a summary seeking to de-notify the minister has already been sent [to the governor].”  The CM said that he had signed the summary and sent it to the governor a day earlier."

  "description": "Prime Minister’s Coordinator for Health Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad on Saturday said that the government has formulated a comprehensive strategy to protect the people from mpox and advised the public against worrying. Mpox, formerly called monkeypox, can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the recent outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern on Wednesday after the new variant of the virus was identified.      A new form of the virus has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. A case of the new variant was confirmed on Thursday in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. Pakistan’s first suspected case was quarantined on Thursday as well and instructions were subsequently issued to enhance monitoring. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Dr Ahmad said that people need not worry as only one case was reported in the country, adding that surveillance and screening mechanisms were in place at all airports and points of entry. Dr Ahmad said laboratories were allocated for diagnosis in all provinces and the federal capital. He said cases were reported from Africa and travellers from Africa, America and the Gulf countries would be monitored. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the federal capital and provinces have taken steps on a joint priority basis. Dr Ahmad said the Ministry of Health was ensuring continuous monitoring on a daily basis and the government was also closely monitoring the situation.            View this post on Instagram              He said the ministry was in full contact with the provinces and a daily meeting was being conducted on the prime minister’s instructions. Dr Ahmad appealed to the public to isolate at home if their family had a travel history or mpox symptoms. Dr Ahmad instructed the public to contact a qualified doctor and follow their instructions in case of showing any symptoms of mpox. He said that symptoms could take 10 to 15 days to appear and spending too much time with the patient could spread the infection. “It is better if the patient is quarantined,” he said, adding that fever medicines were used for mpox.     PM orders strict vigilance Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz ordered strict vigilance on the spread of the disease. Chairing a meeting on the measures being taken against the viral infection’s spread, the prime minister instructed that effective screening measures be ensured at all airports, seaports and borders, besides asking Border Health Services to keep complete surveillance of the situation. He also directed the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) to remain alert and evaluate the situation daily. The premier also tasked the NCOC with ensuring the provision of all required gadgets and kits for evaluating the virus. PM Shehbaz asked for the launch of an effective awareness campaign, hinting that he would have a weekly briefing on the mpox situation.         The meeting’s members were apprised of the situation about the spread of the virus. They were told that a person in Mardan district was diagnosed as the carrier of the virus and he had just returned to Pakistan from abroad where he was employed. He was quarantined and his condition was out of danger. The gathering was told that no local transmission of mpox was detected in the country. The members were further informed that the federal and provincial governments were launching awareness drives and the Civil Aviation Authority would supervise the flights arriving from abroad. Further details were also provided, including that the provincial governments, governments of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Islamabad Capital Territory administration had allocated isolation wards and beds in the largest hospitals for possible cases and all precautionary measures were in place. DC reviews mpox screening measures at Islamabad Airport Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) Irfan Nawaz visited Islamabad Airport to review the screening process for incoming international passengers and instructed that the screening process be expedited to ensure the timely identification of any potential mpox cases. According to a spokesperson for the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), DC Nawaz said health department personnel were deployed at the airport, where every passenger arriving from overseas was being thoroughly screened. If any symptoms were detected, the individual would be isolated and transferred to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Hospital, the DC said. He added that PIMS Hospital was designated as an Isolation Management Unit for mpox cases. A special focal person was appointed to oversee the unit’s operations, ensuring that all necessary precautions and treatments were effectively managed. Meanwhile, a statement from the Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson said strict surveillance continued at domestic airports for mpox and special arrangements were in place for hospitals in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It said that the director general of the KP health services visited the facilities and reviewed arrangements and protocols for the prevention of mpox. The statement quoted the Peshawar airport administration as saying that people suffering from mpox would be transferred from quarantine to the police hospital by Rescue 1122.

  "description": "PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui has indicated that his party would no longer “repeatedly call out” to the PTI for talks, while reiterating that the latter needed to approach it with seriousness. Relations between the PTI and the PML-N-led coalition government — already tense since party founder Imran Khan’s ouster in 2022 — have grown even more strained over time. While the PML-N has repeatedly offered a dialogue to the PTI, the latter’s founder Imran Khan has cited certain conditions, including the return of its “stolen mandate”, and has instead preferred holding talks with the military establishment. Earlier this month, senior PTI leader MNA Ali Muhammad Khan indicated that his party might be open to negotiating with the PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P to resolve ongoing tensions between the government and the opposition, provided PTI’s demands are met.      Speaking on Dawn News’ programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, which was aired on Friday night, Siddiqui said: “We repeatedly said ‘fine, you have entered the House (Parliament) — in whatever way you have — then at least sit together on that level and try to solve your matters’. “[But] they do not want to talk, and we have also thought that now we will not repeatedly call out to them from our rooftops that ‘come, talk to us’,” the politician added. However, he went on to say that the PML-N and its coalition partners would “consider whether to open the door or not” for talks with the PTI if the latter “approached it seriously”.     The senator stressed that holding a dialogue depended on when the PTI would have realised that “we shouldn’t have talks with the army but with politicians”. He added that perhaps Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chief of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and leader of the opposition alliance, would be “successful in making [the PTI] understand” that a dialogue among political parties was needed. “The point is that a party does not want to hold talks with you, and this is that party which was clearly seen behind the May 9 [incidents],” Senator Siddiqui said, referring to the violent protests last year following Imran’s arrest. Speaking about the government’s decision to seek a ban on the PTI, Senator Siddiqui asserted that the PTI’s role “cannot be the role of a patriotic [political] party”. “This party’s role can not be called pro-Pakistani in any manner,” the PML-N lawmaker said. Siddiqui went on to list the PTI’s letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and protests it has organised outside the Fund’s office, the May 9 riots as well as multiple resolutions passed in the US Congress. “All these elements and ingredients are such on the basis of which a decision can be made. When the National Awami Party was banned, they hadn’t taken such actions. They hadn’t carried out such attacks like the PTI has done,” the senator said. “We will also see what Faiz Hameed sahib discloses. After that, we will consider,” he said, stating that it was yet to be seen how and when the decision to ban would be implemented. Gen Faiz probe a ‘national’ matter: Siddiqui On the arrest and court martial proceedings against former intelligence chief Lt Gen (retired) Faiz Hameed, Siddiqui said the action was a “huge one” and “nothing ordinary”. He said the matter was a “national” one rather than the military’s own. Senator Siddiqui further said there was a possibility of the probe about Gen Faiz’s post-retirement activities “connecting to May 9 [incidents], as is being speculated”. “If there was anything major carried out after quitting the uniform (retiring)  […] — whether you may call it a huge incident, an accident, an action, a mutiny or a conspiracy — that is May 9. […] So if any role of [Gen Faiz] behind that is revealed, then accountability should be done.” He said that by “magnifying, spreading or connecting the matter far away, perhaps the army’s efforts to focus and review the issue of the role that the respected general played while in his uniform and in the Top City case”, adding that “there may be a few other matters as well”. “Secondly, what did he do after retirement in his post-uniform era […] so let the army decide and investigate. We do not want to create some complication in this and spread the matter.” ‘Imran led, Gen Faiz enabled him’: info minister Meanwhile, information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Gen Faiz and other former military officers, were arrested only because Imran engaged in the politics of incitement, division and hate. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Tarar alleged that Gen Faiz and his cohorts enabled Imran in damaging national security, calling the former premier the “leader of the collusion”. “No one can be allowed to collude and spread destruction,” the minister said. On the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz, Tarar said that the development was a positive one and the government stood with the decision. “Self-accountability needs to take place within other institutions as well,” he said. “Who brought terrorism back to Pakistan?” Tarar said, referring to the PTI government’s plan to relocate thousands of fighters from the outlawed Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP) to the country. “Didn’t the PTI founder conspire with them and say that the Taliban should be brought back?” the info minister asked.

  "description": "PTI maverick Sher Afzal Khan Marwat on Saturday said he had ended all reservations that he held against the party leadership after a meeting with former prime minister Imran Khan, adding that he was also tasked with leading a party rally next week. “I have forgiven everyone from my end,” Marwat said while speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail. Last month, the PTI had suspended his membership for constantly violating the party discipline, several statements criticising the party leaders and purportedly making “derogatory remarks” about Imran in one instance, Earlier this month, confu­sion surrounded his expulsion from PTI after a notification went viral on social media mentioning that his membership was cancelled for gross violation/breach of discipline while some other party sources had claimed the notification was ‘fake’. Marwat had reportedly offered to resign from his National Assembly seat and get re-elected as an independent candidate, however, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said he would meet Imran before accepting the resignation. While speaking outside Adiala Jail today, Marwat said he met Imran after three months and spoke of their warm exchange. He said he told Imran all his complaints during the meeting and the PTI founder told his own but ultimately, “all misunderstandings have been cleared”. Marwat said that in the presence of other party leaders, Imran tasked him with the responsibility of a rally on August 22 as well as overall duties of protests across the country. “I told him that people are ready to come out. Just give me the responsibility then whatever the consequence would be, they would be on us. Because we want to take out the people for your sake.” Marwat further announced: “On Khan’s instructions, I have ended any reservation I had against the [party] leadership. I have forgiven everyone from my end. The matter is now buried after talking with Khan.” On questions about returning to the party, Marwat said he was never removed and the notification of his membership’s cancellation was “fake”. Marwat said he also Imran to which the PTI founder agreed that any future complaints and concerns be put before Barrister Gohar or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to investigate and determine. The PTI maverick also rubbished the media hype over his alleged removal from the party and questioned how it all ended, terming the entire episode a “drama” while using his catchphrase of “war gaya” (went bust).            View this post on Instagram              “No one can eliminate the love between me and Khan with backbiting.” Marwat said he was vindicated by the love and respect shown to him by the PTI founder, saying they would be a “lifelong asset” for him. Questioned about recent divisions in the party in KP, Marwat said Imran tasked Barrister Gohar with looking into the matter and had sent a “clear message” that no groupings or conflicts in the party were acceptable. Asked about his prior stated differences with Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub, Marwat reiterated: “There were differences before which have now come to an end. You will no longer hear anything from my mouth about them.”     Spilling on plans for the Aug 22 rally, he said the party would go to Lahore with hundreds of thousands of supporters and would not care about any arrests or non-objection certificates. “We will remain peaceful but anyone attempting to erect obstacles will invite the wrath of the people.” On any strategy for protests, he said: “We will make the plans for protests and demonstrations because if God forbid some May 9 [type incident] occurs then the blame doesn’t go to Khan, we will be responsible for any [future] May 9. I will give my head because I will make any strategy without asking for permission from Imran … we won’t do any vandalism or burning but will use constitutional measures.” Marwat said he would respond to any crackdown or violence against the party and the party leadership or Imran would have nothing to do with it. Marwat was removed from the party’s core and political committees in May on Imran’s direction, following the maverick’s controversial statements regarding Saudi Arabia. Ayub had said that, according to Imran, Marwat had “dealt an uncountable loss to the PTI’s interests and relationship with Saudi Arabia, and by extension, Imran’s personal relations with Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, because of his misleading statements.” Marwat refuted the comments and said that the decision was “made in advance” and only Imran’s name was attached to it. PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan had put Marwat on blast last month after a video surfaced of him seemingly criticising Imran. "

  "description": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday summoned representatives from the federal government, the information ministry and the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) on August 21 over the issue of countrywide internet disruptions. Major online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been hit hard since last week with users reporting slowdowns and difficulties in accessing messaging and social media applications. After months of speculation about the installation of a so-called ‘firewall’ that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed a day ago that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cyber security threats. Concerns about Pakistan’s economy potentially being hit hard due to the outages have been raised by the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), and the Pakistan Business Council that warned of multinational companies exiting the country. Justice Shakil Ahmad took up a petition yesterday, filed the day before by Advocate Muhammad Nadeem. The petitioner had requested the court to declare “internet shutdowns” unconstitutional and to order the government to ensure uninterrupted internet services. The federal government — through the law and information ministries as well as the cabinet division secretary — along with the PTA chairman were named as respondents in the case. During yesterday’s hearing, the judge had grilled the state counsel for his lack of “knowledge” and seriousness in the matter, and had reserved his verdict on the petition. Issuing the reserved verdict today, Justice Ahmad ordered that representatives of all the respondents in the case should ensure their attendance in the next hearing. The judge summoned one representative each from the federal government, the Ministry of Information and the PTA at the next hearing on August 21. He also sought responses from all parties on the matter. Petition The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed on Thursday by Advocate Muhammad Nadeem. The federal government — through the law and information ministries as well as the cabinet division secretary — along with the PTA chairman were named as respondents in the case. It requested that the “action of the federal government (internet shutdowns) be declared to be unconstitutional and unlawful being inconsistent” with various articles of the Constitution. According to the petition, the actions were in violation of Articles 9 (security of person), 18 (freedom of trade, business or profession), 19 (freedom of speech, etc), 19A (right to information) and 25A (equality of citizens). It further urged the court to order the federal government to “ensure uninterrupted internet services throughout” the country. “If internet shutdowns in the interest of national security and in the wake of law and order, same is to be intimated to public at large prior to closure citing reasons for closer and providing time frame as to duration of internet closure,” the petition read. It argued that “by blocking, filtering, or shutting down these services, the government is eroding civic space; fostering a climate of economic uncertainty and disrupting access to healthcare, online business, emergency services and financial services.” “Apart from the general public, hundreds, if not thousands, of companies have also been affected. Ride-hailing companies like Bykea, Careem and InDrive have taken the brunt, as their users — both drivers and passengers — need mobile data on the go,” the petition argued. “Should these shutdowns continue even if they are limited to certain social media platforms they are likely to have far-reaching implications for investor confidence, export growth, and the country’s reputation in the global technology market,” it warned.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday revealed that former spymaster Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, who is currently facing court martial proceedings, had apologised to him for subjecting him to victimisation. Calling the arrest of former ISI chief a miracle, Mr Dar said: “I am among the victims of Faiz Hameed.” However, he added, the retired general had tendered an apology for his “excesses”. Mr Dar did not give details of excesses blamed on the ex-spymaster. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Gen Faiz and three other retired officers were taken into custody for allegedly victimising the owner of a private housing society in the federal capital.  Gohar says ex-spymaster had no contact with PTI after his retirement  On the arrest of Gen Faiz, Mr Dar said such a development had taken place for the first time in the country’s history, adding that the arrest had finally brought to an end a project that had started in 2011. In a statement, Mr Dar, who also holds the portfolio of foreign ministry, said the PTI dharna in 2014 had failed but it had adversely affected the country’s economy. In July 2017, the Supreme Court had disqualified both Mr Dar and Nawaz Sharif from holding public office, following the publication of Panama Papers. In September 2017, a NAB court indicted Mr Dar in the Panama Papers corruption case for having wealth beyond his known sources of income but in October that year he fell ill while in Saudi Arabia and left for the United Kingdom for medical treatment. In December 2017, an accountability court declared Mr Dar proclaimed offender after he repeatedly failed to appear before the court.      After the change of government, Mr Dar was appointed minister of finance in September 2022. In April this year, he was given the additional charge of deputy prime minister. Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told media persons that Gen Faiz’s arrest was an internal matter of the army in which he and others should not interfere. He said that following the retirement of the ISI chief, the PTI had no contact with him. Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

  "description": "PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa communication and works minister Shakeel Ahmad was de-notified as a cabinet member on Friday amid growing infighting in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf over alleged corruption and irregularities in top echelons of the province’s leadership. Mr Shakeel claimed that he quit the cabinet, with his “resignation letter” starting to circulate on social media platforms around midnight. However, the provincial government insisted that the communication minister was removed on the recommendation of a three-member accountability committee formed by the chief minister on the orders of the ruling party’s imprisoned founder, Imran Khan. A summary for the minister’s ouster was sent to the governor for approval, according to a spokesman for the government.  Shakeel accuses PTI govt of bad governance, corruption, says will ‘explain reasons for quitting cabinet’ in PA  A notification issued by the administration department read, “Governor KP, in exercise of power conferred under Clause 3 of the Article 132 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is pleased to de-notify Mr Shakeel Ahmed, minister for communication and works from his office. It added that on his de-notification from his respective office, Mr Shakeel had ceased to hold the portfolio of the provincial minister with immediate effect. In his resignation letter addressed to the governor, Mr Shakeel noted that he was quitting the cabinet position with great disappointment. Listing the grounds for his resignation, Mr Shakeel insisted that the provincial government was compromised on its basic principles and commitments made by the PTI with the people at large during the election campaign. “The people voted in favour of PTI on its anti-establishment stand but the provincial government has taken a step backwards from its principle stance,” he said. The former minister also said that the bad governance and corruption at all levels of the provincial government had destroyed the image of the PTI’s programme and manifesto in the eyes of party workers. “I offer myself before accountability at all forums,” he said. He also said that he tried to raise voice against injustice, bad governance, mismanagement and corruption, as enshrined in the manifesto of the PTI. “I shall explain the reasons for my resignation from the cabinet on the floor of the house in detail. In light of the above facts and circumstances, my resignation may please be accepted immediately,” he added. However, spokesman for the provincial government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif told a news conference that a three-member committee was formed on the orders of PTI founder Imran Khan sometime ago to investigate the allegations of corruption against members of the provincial government. He said the committee, after recording statements of the people concerned and holding an investigation, had recommended the removal of Mr Shakeel. Mr Saif said that a summary for Mr Shakeel’s removal was forwarded to the governor on Thursday. “Late at night, reports of Mr Shakeel’s resignation started appearing in the media,” he said. On August 2, Mr Shakeel and Barrister Saif addressed a joint presser on the orders of PTI party Imran Khan to deliver a stern warning to ministers and bureaucracy in the province that they will be held responsible for corruption and mismanagement in their respective departments. The news conference was held after Mr Shakeel along with party’s general secretary Omar Ayub and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in Adiala prison a day earlier. Communication and works department secretary Dr Asad Ali Khan was posted out the same evening after Mr Shakeel’s meeting with the PTI founder. The chief minister had formed a three-member committee comprising former governor Shah Farman, senior lawyer Qazi Anwar and adviser to the chief minister on anti-corruption retired Brigadier Musaadiq Abbasi to investigate the allegations of corruption in top government circles. On the other hand, a party leader, familiar with the proceedings of the accountability committee, told Dawn that allegations against Mr Shakeel were established before the committee. He said that the committee’s report had been submitted to the chief minister, while it would also be placed before the party’s founder next Tuesday. Another top PTI leader, who also requested anonymity, defended Mr Shakeel and said the party’s ranks and file were unhappy over his removal. He said that Mr Shakeel was given the portfolio on the orders of Imran Khan. “Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was unhappy with Mr Shakeel over his August 2 press conference,” he said. The PTI leader claimed that Mr Gandapur asked Mr Shakeel to “tone down his rhetoric” in media talk as it would tarnish the image of the provincial government and the party, but the latter didn’t listen to him. He also raised questions about the composition accountability committee and insisted that one memberwas the chief minister’s subordinate, while another was “cosying” with him. The party leader said Imran Khan had proposed the name of Junaid Akbar, MNA from Malakand, for the committee but the chief minister ignored him and selected a committee of his own choosing instead. Interestingly, this is the second time Mr Shakeel has been ousted from the cabinet. On January 26 2020, Mr Shakeel, the then revenue minister, was sacked along with senior minister Mohammad Atif Khan and health minister Shahram Khan Tarakai on the charge of plotting against the then chief minister, Mahmood Khan. Mr Atif has supported Mr Shakeel after his removal. In a post on his X account, the former senior minister wrote, “Shakeel has remained my cabinet colleague for a decade and I have not seen a more honest person than him. He has pointed out corruption in the KP cabinet in his meeting with Imran Khan in prison. There is conspiracy against Shakeel and I will reveal two of its characters at an opportune time.” Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: The ongoing anti-polio campaign in Karachi has seen 27 per cent refusals in 40 of the 85 high-risk union committees (UCs) covered on the first day of the drive, it emerged on Friday. A session organised for journalists by the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for Polio on Friday highlighted that Pakistan’s polio struggle had become a tragedy as the country today faced internal challenges more than any potential threat from people’s movements from neighbouring Afghanistan where situation had improved. “There are reasons why the virus is still circulating [in our environment]. The ongoing drive saw 27 per cent refusal on its first day during which 62 per cent coverage of 40 UCs was achieved,” shared EOC Coordinator Irshad Sodhar. He said that 18pc of the 48pc children who were left out were not at home.  High refusal rate attributed to lack of awareness among parents about needle-free jet injectors, says official  The high refusal, he reasoned, was due to lack of awareness among parents about the new method adopted for vaccination this time and operational challenges, hoping for better outcomes during the Aug 15-25 drive in 85 high-risk UCs.      According to experts, the ongoing drive is the first large-scale vaccination campaign using needle-free jet injectors to administer fractional doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (f-IPV). The method was earlier used at a limited scale in Karachi in 2019. The f-IPV single dose, they said, had been used in number of polio outbreak settings, generally along with oral polio vaccine (OPV) and several countries were using two doses of f-IPV in their routine immunisation programmes instead of a full dose IPV. “A single dose of f-IPV is highly immunogenic, and two doses have shown even higher immunity levels. If oral polio drops are co-administered with f-IPV, they help improve gut immunity and prevent viral transmission in the community,” explained Dr Khalid Shafi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association. Polio outbreak threat While acknowledging government efforts, Dr Shafi and Dr Ali Faisal Saleem, senior paediatrician at Aga Khan University Hospital, expressed concern over the polio situation in the country that had seen 14 confirmed cases and a large number of positive environmental samples this year. The country, they emphasised, couldn’t afford neglect at this critical time else there could be a major outbreak of polio that would be difficult to control. Community hesitancy against vaccination, Dr Saleem warned, was growing and collaborative efforts were needed to tackle the challenge. On the link between nutrition and vaccination, he said that vaccines were effective even in children with poor nutritional status. The experts agreed with the opinion about having a holistic approach towards the polio challenge that’s needed to be linked with efforts aimed at improving child-mother nutrition, breastfeeding and hygiene practices as well as family planning at the grassroots level. “There is no doubt that provision of clean drinking water is the first step to prevent infectious diseases followed by vaccination,” Dr Shafi remarked. National Coordinator Anwarul Haq and technical focal person Dr Ahmed Ali Sheikh also spoke. Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

  "description": "LAHORE: In a rather peculiar turn of events, confusion reigned among official and journalistic circles after it emerged that a senior official — thought to be in custody — was sitting comfortably at home as news channels ran reports of his supposed arrest. On Friday, several media outlets aired re­­ports that former ins­pector general (Prisons) for Punjab Shahid Saleem Baig had been taken into custody. It was speculated that the arrest may be connected to the action initiated against other officials from Adiala jail over their alleged role in providing ‘facilitation’ to incarcerated former PM, Imran Khan. Former Adiala jail deputy superintendent Mohammad Akram and another junior official have already been taken into custody in connection with the charges. Initially, it was reported that Mr Baig had been picked up in a raid on his Lahore residence, and the development was ‘confirmed’ by several key government officials who are thought to be privy to such developments. By late evening, however, a video began circulating on social media platforms, showing the former prisons IG sipping tea in a domestic setting, while watching reports of his supposed arrest being aired on mainstream media. In the video, he can be heard expressing his annoyance at the national media, declaring the reports of his arrest “yellow journalism”. “I am watching news of my arrest on TV with a cup of tea at my home, with my family members,” he can be heard saying. Mr Baig could not be reached for comment. Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday said trade with India was not on the cards, citing the unchanged situation in held Kashmir since the 2019 events that led to the initial suspension. “The situation remains intact, and at this point there are no bilateral talks between the two countries with respect to bilateral trade between Pakistan and India,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing. She was responding to a question regarding India’s lack of reciprocation to Pakistan’s overtures for restoring trade relations. Pakistan had suspended trade with India after it revoked the special status of the Occupied Jammu and Kashmir region in August 2019 in a controversial move.      Leaders of PML-N government have on multiple occasions since coming to office earlier this year expressed Shehbaz Sharif administration’s willingness to reevaluate trade relations with India, with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar emphasising the Pakistani business community’s eagerness to revive trade ties during a London press conference on March 23. Rooted in a semi-urban and industrialist coalition led by Nawaz Sharif, the PML-N has historically championed the economic benefits of normalised trade with India. But a potential resumption of trade, despite the 2019 controversial move, could indicate a strategic shift in Pakistan’s approach towards the dispute while prioritising economic interests. Referring to a recent incident of killing of four Kashmiri youths by Indian forces in the Doda district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), the spokesperson said it showed the unlawful and repressive tactics employed by the Indian authorities against the Kashmiris. “We urge the international community to take immediate and decisive action to hold India accountable for its egregious human rights violations in IIOJK and to take steps to protect the rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people,” she said. Gaza ceasefire Commenting on the Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha, the spokesperson welcomed the diplomatic effort and recalled that Islamabad has repeatedly since October 2023 called for an urgent and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. The negotiations, however, were suspended on Friday without any breakthrough. The devastating ten-month barrage of Gaza and other Palestinian communities by Israel has left a staggering trail of over 40,000 casualties, underscoring the desperate need for an immediate ceasefire. Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination, blamed on Israel by both Hamas and Iran, has only added to the sense of urgency, as tensions between Iran and Israel are now running precariously high. The spokesperson skirted a question about the absence of Hamas from the talks saying, “Pakistan is not party to these talks in Doha. So we are not in a position to comment on the details of these negotiations.” She separately noted that Pakistan was “not involved in any mediation” to defuse the situation in the Middle East.

  "description": "LONDON: Jemima Goldsmith, the former spouse of PTI founder Imran Khan, has revealed that she had to block emails from Pakistan due to alleged cyber harassment. Ms Goldsmith posted a statement on her Instagram and X accounts on Friday blaming opponents of her ex-husband’s party, PTI, for the alleged “cyber harassment operation”. “To friends in Pakistan legitimately trying to contact me - I have had to block all emails from Pakistan thanks to a cyber harassment operation against me, no doubt instigated by PTI’s desperate opponents,” Ms Goldsmith said in a post on her X account.         She also quipped that since the platform is banned in Pakistan “by said desperate opponents,” only users accessing X via VPNs will see her post.      “Pakistani politics, the gift that keeps on giving even after leaving the country 20 years ago,” the British film producer said in an apparent reference to years of social media campaigns against her due to her past relationship with Mr Khan, Though many social media users often adore Ms Goldsmith, the critics of her ex-spouse have targeted her by using misogynistic and racist language. When former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was self-exiled in London between 2019 and 2023, PML-N supporters staged demonstrations outside the Surrey home of Ms Goldsmith’s mother. Some reports indicated that protestors were threatening to break into the residence if she did not come outside. At the time, PML-N supporters said it was payback for PTI staging frequent protests outside the Avenfield House where Mr Sharif was living. Ms Goldsmith lived in Pakistan when she was married to PTI founder Imran Khan from 1995 to 2004. They had two sons together, Sulaiman and Kasim. Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Friday filed a pe­­tition with the Islam­abad High Court to halt the trial in the GBP190 million corruption case, while his sisters, Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan, approached the Supreme Court seeking the recusal of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa from cases involving their brother, but their plea was not entertained by the SC office. Imran Khan’s petition contended that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had recommended closing the £190m corruption reference in its 343rd Executive Board meeting in April 2020, and that during cross-examination, the investigation officer acknowledged certain facts related to the meeting. The petition, filed by Barrister Salman Safdar and Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, said the former prime minister had filed an application before an accountability court, seeking the case record, but it was dismissed by the judge. It may be mentioned that the investigation officer in the case is the last prosecution witness. He has testified before the accountability court a couple of weeks ag, but the defence counsel could not completed his cross-examination for various reasons.  SC office turns down his sisters’ application seeking recusal of CJP from cases involving ex-PM  The petition said: “The investigation officer of the case appeared before the accountability court as PW [prosecution witness] 35 and during the cross-examination, he categorically admitted the holding of 343rd EBM, [and] closure of this case by the above EBM.” It said the minutes of the aforementioned meeting are in the possession of NAB and need to be produced before the trial court as crucial evidence in support of the defence. The petition requested the IHC to issue a directive for NAB to produce the relevant record before the trial court, and stay the trial proceedings till the submission of the record. Recusal of CJP Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan submitted a two-page application for the recusal of CJP Isa from the cases in which their brother was a party. However, Shahbaz Khosa, son of PTI leader Sardar Latif Khosa, later told Dawn that the application was not accepted by the Supreme Court office, despite attempts to have it entertained. He regretted that when none of the advocates-on-record — who are authorised to plead on behalf of a party — came forward to file the application in the Supreme Court, they attempted to approach the registrar’s office, but were unsuccessful. “As a consequence, we were left with no option but to hold a press conference,” he said. “We, as PTI leaders, will continue making attempt to file the application again and again.”      During the press conference, PTI Chairman Bar­rister Gohar Ali Khan veh­emently objected to the remarks made by CJP Faez Isa in the Monal case reg­arding the £190m related to the Al-Qadir Trust case, and urged the top judge to refrain from making comments, especially since the case is in its final stages at the lower court. He said the SC’s Code of Conduct suggested that a judge should not make observations when a case, or a petitioner or a party was not before him. Latif Khosa regretted that he had not seen any instance in his entire 50 years of professional life that an application was not received by the court office. He recalled the Feb 11, 2021 judgement, in which a five-judge SC bench, led by then-CJP Gulzar Ahmed, had ruled that Justice Isa should recuse himself from hearing cases involving then-PM Imran Khan, given that the judge had already filed a petition against the PTI founder in his personal capacity. Keeping in view that judgement, the incumbent CJP should also chose not to hear any case in which Imran Khan was a party, he said. The application stated that the observations by the CJP in the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) contempt case should be withdrawn and that the top judge should not be part of any case in which their brother was a party. “Further, we reserved our right to initiate proceeding before the Supreme Judicial Council in this regard,” it said.

  "description": "QUETTA: The provincial Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has expressed concerns over the delays in the Quetta Development Package, which includes the realignment of roads to cope with increasing traffic jams. The apex audit body of the Balochistan Assembly met on Friday with MPA Asghar Ali Tareen in the chair. The committee noted that Rs2 billion had been spent on the project, which should have been completed by 2020. But the work is still ongoing four years later, Mr Tareen noted.  Apex audit body laments four-year lapse despite Rs2bn allocation  “The project has been delayed due to the incompetence of the officials,” he said, adding that this increased the project’s cost. The committee member said this was an “injustice to the people of the province.” The meeting also audited the accounts of the provincial Planning and Development Department and the Balochistan Education Foundation for the fiscal years 2021-22 and audit paras for 2022-23.      Mr Tareen expressed surprise at relevant officers who pleaded helplessness when asked why the work on Sirki Road was stopped due to the actions of a few individuals. The PAC chairman stated that such interference in government’s affairs was causing distress to the people of Quetta, and no one was addressing it. He directed the relevant authorities to immediately contact Quetta’s administration to resume the work. The chairman also instructed the departments to present a comprehensive report on the project within a month, stressing that more delays were “unacceptable”. He highlighted the need for proper accounting and reconciliation of funds, emphasising that institutions must ensure transparency and accountability in their accounts. He directed the department to ensure that all funds are used for their intended purposes and that any misuse of funds will be accounted for. The PAC members, in a separate meeting with the Balochistan Education Foundation officials, questioned why the grants-in-aid were not used for their intended purposes. The chairman emphasised that the purpose of these aids was to benefit the public. The committee’s chairman emphasised the importance of accountability over the use of public funds, stating that taxpayers’ money should be used with utmost responsibility and transparency. He expressed serious concern over the absence of the additional chief secretary (Planning and Development) and the principal accounting officers of various departments. This reflected the departments’ lack of seriousness, Mr Tareen added. The meeting was attended by PAC members as well as Balochistan Assembly Secretary Tahir Shah Kakar, Planning and Development Secretary Wali Muhammad Barech, Balochistan Accountant General Nasarullah Jan, Audit DG Shuja Ali, PAC Additional Secretary Siraj Lehri, and other officials.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawa­lpindi bench on Friday issued notices to the defence and home secretaries, the Punjab prisons IG and station house officer Saddar Bairuni on a petition seeking the recovery of the former deputy superintendent of Central Jail Adiala. The petition alleged that Deputy Super­intendent Jail Mohammad Akram was picked up by an intelligence agency from his residence in the prison’s Officers’ Colony. The petition stated that the whereabouts of the detenue were unknown since his abduction and requested the court to direct the authorities concerned to trace and produce him before the court. Akram was reportedly taken into custody by law-enforcement agencies on charges of ‘facilitating the PTI founder as a messenger’ on Wednesday. Although recently posted out from Adiala Jail, he was still residing with his family in the Officers’ Colony. His wife, Memoona Riaz, filed the petition through her counsel Imaan Mazari, which was heard by Justice Muhammad Raza Qureshi. Advocate Mazari contended that the petitioner’s husband was forcibly taken by personnel claiming to be from law enfo­rcement agencies on Wednesday. The petition stated that “the unknown masked personnel (who had arrived in a Vigo) informed the petitioner that they were “with the Department/Mehekma” and that she should send her husband outside. The detenu then approached the main gate to inform the officials that he would come with them but he needed to change his clothes and use the toilet. The armed men continued to ring the door’s bells till the detenu came back to the main gate,. The armed masked personnel dragged him in front of his family, and the latter requested them that he be allowed to briefly meet the Adiala Jail superintendent before they took him. This request was refused, the petition stated. Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2024 "

APP/PPI/File  Wahab blames PML-N govt for signing IPPs contracts in haste.\"Provincial card should not be played on electricity-related issues.\"Aslam says Punjab power subsidy tantamount to wasting...",
  "content": "    The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came together to criticise the Punjab government's plan to provide relief to power consumers for two months by terming it a move taken merely for optics. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Nawaz Sharif had announced the two-month power subsidy programme for the Punjab people a day ago which would be given to the consumers using up to 500 units in August and September bills. PPP leader Murtaza Wahab, speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan on Saturday, said that every government has prioritised providing relief to the masses but that should be granted on a long-term basis. Commenting on the Punjab government’s power relief plan, he said that the provincial government would bear a financial expense of Rs45 billion while the relief would only last for only two months. Wahab blamed the PML-N government for signing contracts with the independent power producers (IPPs) in haste. He was of the view that the government is responsible for providing long-term relief instead of such moves taken merely for optics. Wahab added: “Provincial card should not be played on electricity-related issues.” The Karachi mayor, whose party is a coalition partner of the ruling PML-N in the Centre, invited the federal government to formulate long-term plans with the PPP to provide relief to the masses. In the same programme, Adviser on Finance to the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Muzammil Aslam also criticised Punjab’s two-month power subsidy announcement, saying that it would be tantamount to wasting public resources in the name of relief. He claimed that unsustainable power projects were launched in Punjab — the most populous province of Pakistan — which generate electricity at the cost of Rs75 per unit via imported furnace. On the other hand, Sindh and the KP were generating low-cost electricity, he added. He further claimed that the cost of per unit electricity generation would be Rs8 through the new power projects in the KP. Aslam said that the KP government also allocated Rs20 billion for its solarisation project and is providing solar systems to each family at the cost of Rs200,000. A day earlier, PML-N President Nawaz along with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced to slash the development fund to give Rs14 per unit relief in power bills to consumers using up to 500 units for the two months. The PML-N president, patting the shoulder of her daughter CM Maryam, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also welcomed the \"historic\" relief package for electricity consumers by the Punjab chief minister. He said efforts are being made to find a lasting and sustainable solution to power crisis by taking measures against electricity theft and reforms in the power sector. The premier said recently, his administration diverted Rs50 billion from the development budget of the federal government and gave relief in electricity prices, from which consumers with 200 units are benefiting."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Saturday issued an advisory for potential heavy rains and flash flooding in many parts of the country, anticipating that severe weather conditions expected to persist until August 19. In the advisory issued here, the NDMA forecast widespread thunderstorm rain in Sindh, South Punjab and Balochistan, potentially leading to flash floods.  “Widespread thunderstorm rain of moderate to heavy intensity with scattered very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls is expected over Sindh along DG Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Zhob, Loralai, Nasirabad, Sibbi, Kalat and Makran Divisions,” it stated.  Moreover, the authority said, medium to high level flash flooding is expected in the hill torrents of DG Khan division and in the Nullahs of Sibbi, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat Larkana and Hyderabad (Dadu and Naushahro Feroze Districts) Divisions from August 17 to August 19. The NDMA has also issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and severe weather.  The departments have been directed to enhance monitoring of developing situation to reduce response times.  All civic agencies and rescue services are directed to remain alert and ensure availability of personnel and equipment during the mentioned period, especially in at-risk areas. The NDMA also asked the departments to timely evacuate people living along low-lying/flood prone areas and ensure availability of shelter, food and medicines in those camps. Meanwhile, the authority also warned locals and farmers to shift cattle away from low lying areas adjacent to rivers and their associated tributaries/nullahs. The power distribution companies (Discos) and relevant local departments have been directed to ensure necessary arrangements to avoid electrocution incidents and timely restoration of power supply. They have also been directed to coordinate with concerned departments for clearance of roads in case of any blockage/obstruction, waterlogging and pre-placing of necessary emergency equipment at vulnerable/appropriate locations."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday formed a special committee to probe the matter of \"misogynist\" remarks passed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Iqbal Afridi during a standing committee meeting a day earlier. During a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Power on Friday, MNA Afridi objected to the attire of a representative from the power utility and called for adherence to the modest dress code followed by female lawmakers.  Chaired by Mohammad Idris, Afridi expressed his disapproval, stating, “Chairman, the woman’s attire is inappropriate. There should be a standard operating procedure for dress code in the National Assembly committee.” However, the PTI lawmaker drew sharp rebuke from other ruling parties’ members and attendees present at the session including Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Sherry Rehman and Sindh Government spokesperson Barrister Arsalan Islam Shaikh. Sherry condemned Afridi’s objection to the woman’s attire. “The objection raised by Iqbal Afridi to the woman’s attire in the committee meeting is strongly condemnable. The woman earned her place in that room through her competence and abilities, which should have been respected by all committee members. Women should be evaluated based on their ideas and contributions, not their appearance,” she said in response to Afridi’s comments.  “The speaker of the National Assembly should also demand an apology from him. This behaviour is entirely unacceptable at all levels,” she added. A statement issued today said the NA speaker has taken notice of Afridi's remarks and expressed displeasure over his act.  The probe committee has been formed to unearth facts related to the incident.  The committee led by Federal Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar comprises Naveed Qamar, Amin ul Haque, Malik Muhammad Aamir Dogar and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari. The committee will have the authority to include five women members from the parliamentary parties, the statement said adding that the committee is required to submit a report to the speaker in 15 days."

  "content": "  Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar has said that more big fishes will be netted following the arrest of former spymaster Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid as the scope of investigation will expand. The military earlier this week announced that the ex-director-general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had been taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and a process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated against him. Another three retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest, the army’s media wing said on Thursday. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today (Saturday), Tarar said that the military has its mechanism of self-accountability and recent arrests were done after transparent investigations. \"Be it Saqib or Nisar, the scope of the investigation will expand as things unfold after the arrest of Gen Faiz,\" the minister said while referring to former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar, who was accused of favouring Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan. Recently, rumours on social media claimed that ex-CJP Nisar fled to London and that he could be arrested in the wider inquiry related to the arrest of the former ISI chief but the former top judge rejected such speculations. Speaking to Geo News, Nisar denounced the recent flurry of social media news that his absence may be linked to the arrest of Gen Faiz and confirmed that he’s in London on the annual planned holidays. Accusing the PTI founding chairman of hatching conspiracies in collusion with the detained former spy chief, Tarar said that the cricketer-turned-politician had fostered the politics of chaos, anarchy and division in the country. \"In collusion with Faiz Hamid, he [Khan] conspired to spread unrest and worked against the integrity of the country.  “All these people were involved in the efforts of PTI’s founder to spread chaos and anarchy in the country as the ex-prime minister did politics of manipulation by nexus,\" he said.  The minister said that Khan was a mastermind of the plot against the solidarity of the country and that recently arrested persons were his companions. He further asked as to who brought back the terrorists in the country, saying that the the founding chairman of PTI  supported the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) militants resettlement to the country.  Tarar said that those who harmed the country's peace would meet their fate and would also be brought to book irrespective of their status. He said like Pakistan Army,  other institutions should also start the self-accountability process. On August 12, the military said Gen Faiz had been arrested because there were “multiple instances of violation” of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. “The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,” it added. The military said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company’s owner."

  "content": "    RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) firebrand stalwart Sher Afzal Marwat announced on Saturday that he set aside differences with the party leaders after holding a meeting with the incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. \"I met Imran Khan today after a gap of three months,\" said Marwat while speaking to journalists outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. He added: \"I shook hands with him and the PTI founder hugged me. There was an exchange of complaints from both sides.\" The PTI lawmaker in the National Assembly, who had been engaged in a tense verbal duel with fellow party leaders for a few months, said that he was putting aside his disagreement with the party following the orders and assurance of Khan. The politico, who had faced termination of his basic party membership over the violation of party discipline earlier this month, announced that only the PTI founder could sack him from the party. Marwat also apologised for his statements against the PTI leaders. Elaborating on his future strategy, the PTI firebrand politician said that he was given responsibility to start preparation for August 22 power show.  He added that PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan gave a clear message that differences within the party should not surface again and all of the leaders are now united. The outspoken politician of the embattled former ruling party has faced wrath from fellow leaders multiple times after delivering blunt and controversial remarks against them and on other issues. Earlier this year, Marwat landed himself in hot water after he had claimed that Saudi Arabia was also allegedly involved in the toppling of the Khan-led government in 2022. The top leadership of the former ruling party not only distanced itself from Marwat’s statement about Riyadh but also served a show-cause notice on the beleaguered senior leader of the PTI. Later in August, the PTI decided to cancel Marwat's basic party membership for \"gross violation/ breach\" of discipline. However, the move divided the Imran-founded party’s top leadership as the notification, endorsed by PTI Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi and a group of leaders, was termed \"fake\" by the party chairman."

  "content": "DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods. “I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,” Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life. \"But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.” Pakistan’s high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage. Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests. “This has led to a new trend of ‘monsoon brides’,” said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage. “Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.” Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake. In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon – 15 of them in May and June this year. “Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,” said village elder Mai Hajani, 65. “They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done”. Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money. Shamila’s mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave Rs200,000 ($720) to the young bride’s parents – a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day. Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan. “My husband gave my parents Rs250,000 for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,” she said. “I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,” she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby. “Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.” Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water – its stench overwhelms the area. “We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,” said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma’s mother. “They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,” she added. “The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.”  Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December. The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced. Unicef has reported ‘significant strides’ in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk. “We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,” it said in a report after the 2022 floods. Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods. “When I was there, I thought to myself ‘we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities’,” the daily wage labourer told AFP. Mehtab was just 10 years old. “The night I decided to get her married, I couldn’t sleep,” said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married. An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education. But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive. “I have told my father I want to study,” she said. “I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don’t want this for myself”."

Geo.tvLHC adjourns hearing against internet shutdown till August 21.Court directs parties to ensure their representatives' appearance.Govt defends...",
  "content": "Amid intermittent internet disruptions troubling netizens all across the country, the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday directed the federal government and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to submit their response on the matter.   LHC's Justice Shakil Ahmad, while hearing a petition filed by a citizen named Noman Sarwar against the nationwide internet \"shutdown\", announced the reserved verdict today.  Justice Ahmad ordered all the parties to the case to ensure their representatives' appearance and submit their responses on the next hearing of the case due on August 21. The development comes as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.  The Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led administration has attributed the issue to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. The plea, which mentions the federal government, the PTA, the cabinet secretary, the secretary for information and technology (IT), the secretary of interior and and Ministry of Human Rights as respondents, complains that the authorities didn't give any reason for shutting down social media platforms in the country. It also calls for immediate restoration of internet access and the revocation of the Centre's decision to restrict access to it. \"Businesses and every sphere of life are being affected because of the internet’s closure. Shutting down the internet is also a violation of fundamental rights,\" the petition read. A day earlier, Justice Ahmad, while reserving the verdict, had expressed displeasure over the state counsel's non-seriousness and \"lack of knowledge\" on the matter of the nationwide internet service disruptions. The government's move has been under scrutiny from various sections of society for its adverse economic effects. Chairman Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan has warned that online and electronic-related businesses, an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy, are now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival\". Meanwhile, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has said that frequent internet disruptions threaten to hinder the development of a strong digital infrastructure as the backbone of the country's economic development. However, the federal government has defended its decision to enforce an internet firewall terming it a cybersecurity measure \"that every country in the world takes\". \"Look at the cybersecurity attacks being carried out on the country and the world as well. With the evolution of cybersecurity threats, states need to have a better capability to ensure that the threats are [well] responded to,\" Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said on Thursday."

  "content": "KARACHI: Demanding uniform electricity price throughout the country, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Saturday gave a solution for bringing the electricity price down. \"Instead of blocking the arteries, we presented the government a solution to resolve the issue of inflated electricity bills,\" the MQM-P leader said addressing a press conference in Karachi. He claimed Pakistan possessed electricity beyond its requirement as it had the ability to generate more than 45,000 megawatts electricity. However, he said, the country’s transmission lines had the capacity of merely 22-25,000 megawatts.  Summing up his suggestion for providing people relief, Kamal said the government should sit down and talk with the 30% local and 50% public independent power producers (IPPs) in this regard, keeping aside the 20% foreign IPPs initially, as they had international agreements.  “These IPPs have already made billions of rupees (in terms of charges for their services),” he said. After that, the politician suggested, the government should sit with the foreign IPPs as well and talk to them about the prevailing situation.  He proposed privatisation of electricity distribution companies and giving licence to more companies in a region too. Moreover, the MQM-P leader lambasted the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif as well for announcing relief in electricity price for Punjab only. In a presser on Friday, Nawaz said the Punjab government had prepared a relief package by cutting the power tariff by Rs14 per unit for people consuming up to 500 units of electricity. \"The relief will be given in the bills of August and September,\" he added. He said that the provincial government had slashed its development fund to provide the relief in utility bills. Reacting to the PML-N leader's announcement, Kamal said there was no need for it. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should have instead provided relief for the entire country, he added. Hoping the PM will announce relief in power price for all parts of the country, he rejected the decision to cut the price in Punjab only. “Price for the utility should be cut down by Rs20 a unit nationwide,” the MQM-P leader demanded. The announcement, exclusively shedding power price in Punjab, had ensue a feeling of despair in other regions, he said."

  "content": "Arooba Yousuf has always been a trailblazer. As the first girl in her family to pursue engineering and the first to enter the workforce, she has now made history as one of the 28 female engineers who completed a groundbreaking solar project in Pakistan.  Residing in Karachi, Yousuf, like many others, was driven by the burden of hefty electricity bills to find a solution. This motivation led her to become a solar installer, contributing to the country’s ongoing efforts to address its energy crisis. \"During peak hours, my father would ask us to turn off extra lights and the AC to save on electricity costs,\" she said, adding, \"When I heard about a program where female engineers were being trained as solar installers, I immediately applied. My mother even said, 'You’re going to be installing solar panels on our roof after completing your training'!\" Meanwhile, Muskan Iqbal, a student of electrical engineering and now a certified solar installer, views her achievement as a powerful example for future generations. Reflecting on the societal challenges she and her peers face, Iqbal said: \"We live in a male-dominated society where something as simple as a girl riding a bike can draw amused looks. I don't believe work should be gender-specific. Today, we’ve proven ourselves by becoming the world's first all-women team to install a 24-kilowatt solar system on the roof of Karachi's Hosseini Orphanage.\" Another member of the team, Iman Batool, highlighted the gender disparity in engineering opportunities and said: \"Males are often given more chances to work in the field, while women get stuck in office jobs. This project was the first time we, 28 female engineers, were given the opportunity to complete a major solar installation. It was an incredible learning experience for all of us!\" Tara Uzra, chairperson of LADIES Fund Energy, the implementing partner of this project, expressed her pride in the historic achievement, stating, \"This is the first time in Pakistan's history that an all-women team has completed a rooftop solar installation.  \"Pakistani women are not only courageous and ambitious but are also emerging as world leaders. We expect them not only to continue in this field but also to inspire others throughout their lives,\" Uzra noted. This historic project is not just about installing solar panels, it's about breaking barriers and redefining the role of women in Pakistan's energy sector. Through their work, these women have shown that they are not just capable of contributing to technical fields — they are leading the way."

Facebook/MoFA<p style=\"display: inline !important;\">\"This situation remains intact,\" says FO spokesperson. Baloch condemns...",
  "content": "\"This situation remains intact,\" says FO spokesperson. ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that there were no talks taking place between Pakistan and India for the resumption of bilateral trade. FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, while addressing the weekly press briefing, cited India's illegal and unilateral steps in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) in 2019 as the reason behind the suspension of bilateral trade.  Baloch recalled that several measures including the suspension of trading were taken after the Indian government on August 5, 2019, illegally annexed the IIOJK by revoking the Article 370 of its constitution.  \"This situation remains intact,\" she emphasised.  The main intent behind observing the day is to expose Indian atrocities and show solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir.  Condemning the killing of four Kashmiri youth by Indian occupation forces in Doda district, the spokesperson said the brutal act was yet another example of India's illegal and oppressive steps against the Kashmiri people. She urged the international community to take immediate and decisive action to hold India accountable for its egregious human rights violations in IIOJK and take steps to protect the rights and freedoms of Kashmiri people. On violations of the border, the FO spokesperson urged the interim Afghan government to exercise restraint and avoid unprovoked acts against the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. She said this while responding to a question about rising incidents of cross-border firing and a recent clash between the border forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan near the Torkham border crossing. Earlier this week, security forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan exchanged heavy fire after the former objected to the construction of a controversial checkpost near the border by the Afghans. The cross-border firing incident resulted in the closure of the border for all types of movement. The FO spokesperson said: “First, I would not like to go into history of such border violations from the Afghan side. However, as you know, the recent incident was very unfortunate when on the 12th of August, Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at the Torkham border.” Pakistani forces responded appropriately in self-defence, she added. “We urge the Afghan authorities to exercise restraint and avoid unprovoked acts against Pakistan-Afghanistan border. They must understand that Pakistani forces will always defend their territory.” Baloch further said that they remain ready to resolve any misunderstandings through established diplomatic channels. “I would also like to underline that the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is multifaceted, and it encompasses various aspects of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. This is a historic relationship, so seeing this relationship from a narrow prism would not be advisable.” The spokesperson said Pakistan has consistently raised its concerns about the presence of terrorist hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan. She said Pakistan expects the Afghan authorities to take effective and robust action against the terrorist groups. The spokesperson strongly rejected allegations about Pakistan's role in the ouster of Sheikh Hasina Wajid saying there is absolutely no truth in them. She said Pakistan believes that the people of Bangladesh have the capacity to settle their affairs and determine their future. Baloch strongly denounced the storming of Al-Aqsa mosque by hundreds of extremist settlers led by office bearers of Israeli occupation authorities. She said the desecration of one of Islam's holiest sites and obstruction of the rights of worshippers have deeply hurt the sentiments of Muslims worldwide. This act is a violation of the Geneva Convention and blatant disregard of multiple UNSC resolutions. The spokesperson called upon the international community especially the UN Security Council to take immediate action to end the serious and repeated transgressions against the sanctity of holy sites in Jerusalem, protect the Islamic character of Al-Aqsa and ensure the freedom of worship of the Palestinian people."

  "content": "    ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet committee on Institutional Reforms Friday recommended for curtailing 150,000 vacant positions, banning contingency recruitment, and outsourcing non-core services like cleaning, janitorial work, which will gradually phase out many positions in grades 1 to 16. In a meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, for reducing public sector size and expenses, a committee, chaired by the the finance minister, presented its recommendations for right-sizing in the federal government departments.  The Ministry of Finance was asked to oversee the cash balances of other federal ministries. The committee provided a detailed briefing on recommended reforms for five federal ministries: the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions, Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, the Ministry of Industry and Production, and the Ministry of National Health Services. The committee proposed merging the Ministry of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan with the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions (Safron). The proposal also involves closing 28 institutions across these five ministries, transferring the Ministry of Privatisation and some other ministries to federal units, and merging 12 institutions within these ministries. Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz Sharif directed the authorities concerned that these proposed reforms should be approved by the federal Cabinet and that a comprehensive plan for their implementation be presented. He emphasised that curtailing government expenditure was his top priority. \"The goal of the government’s institutional reforms was to lessen the burden on the national treasury and enhance the quality of services provided to the public,\" he said. The premier ordered that the institutions failing to demonstrate adequate public service performance and burdening the national exchequer should be either terminated immediately or privatised without delay. He also vowed to personally oversee the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA), an organisation supporting small and medium enterprises, and directed that SMEDA be brought under the Prime Minister’s Office. Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, various other federal ministers and relevant senior government officials attended the meeting.

The spokesperson further stated that the passengers from international flights are being screened at the arrival and if a person is found to be infected, they will be moved to the isolation room established by the border health services. Suspected patients' travel history and symptoms details are reviewed in the isolation rooms and samples are sent for PCR testing without further ado, the PAA spokesperson stated. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on Friday raised its risk level assessment for mpox to \"moderate\" from \"low\" for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travellers visiting from affected areas. \"Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported clade I cases,\" its director Pamela Rendi Wagner said.  — With additional input from Reuters"

PPP leader Murtaza Wahab, speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan on Saturday, said that every government has prioritised providing relief to the masses but that should be granted on a long-term basis. Commenting on the Punjab government’s power relief plan, he said that the provincial government would bear a financial expense of Rs45 billion while the relief would only last for only two months. Wahab blamed the PML-N government for signing contracts with the independent power producers (IPPs) in haste. He was of the view that the government is responsible for providing long-term relief instead of such moves taken merely for optics. Wahab added: “Provincial card should not be played on electricity-related issues.” The Karachi mayor, whose party is a coalition partner of the ruling PML-N in the Centre, invited the federal government to formulate long-term plans with the PPP to provide relief to the masses. In the same programme, Adviser on Finance to the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Muzammil Aslam also criticised Punjab’s two-month power subsidy announcement, saying that it would be tantamount to wasting public resources in the name of relief. He claimed that unsustainable power projects were launched in Punjab — the most populous province of Pakistan — which generate electricity at the cost of Rs75 per unit via imported furnace. On the other hand, Sindh and the KP were generating low-cost electricity, he added. He further claimed that the cost of per unit electricity generation would be Rs8 through the new power projects in the KP. Aslam said that the KP government also allocated Rs20 billion for its solarisation project and is providing solar systems to each family at the cost of Rs200,000. A day earlier, PML-N President Nawaz along with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced to slash the development fund to give Rs14 per unit relief in power bills to consumers using up to 500 units for the two months. The PML-N president, patting the shoulder of her daughter CM Maryam, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also welcomed the \"historic\" relief package for electricity consumers by the Punjab chief minister. He said efforts are being made to find a lasting and sustainable solution to power crisis by taking measures against electricity theft and reforms in the power sector. The premier said recently, his administration diverted Rs50 billion from the development budget of the federal government and gave relief in electricity prices, from which consumers with 200 units are benefiting."

According to an advisory, widespread thunderstorm rain of moderate to heavy intensity with scattered very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls is expected over Sindh along DG Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Zhob, Loralai, Nasirabad, Sibbi, Kalat and Makran Divisions.  “Medium to high level flash flooding is expected in the hill torrents of DG Khan division and in the Nullahs of Sibbi, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat Larkana and Hyderabad (Dadu and Naushahro Feroze Districts) Divisions from August 17 to August 19”. Meanwhile, the relevant departments of Punjab, Sindh and Balochsitan have been instructed to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and severe weather. The departments have been directed to enhance monitoring of developing situation to reduce response times. All civic agencies and rescue services are directed to remain alert and ensure availability of personnel and equipment during the mentioned period, especially in at-risk areas. The NDMA also asked the departments to timely evacuate people living along low-lying/flood prone areas and ensure availability of shelter, food and medicines in those camps. Meanwhile, the authority also warned locals and farmers to shift cattle away from low lying areas adjacent to rivers and their associated tributaries/nullahs. The power distribution companies (Discos) and relevant local departments have been directed to ensure necessary arrangements to avoid electrocution incidents and timely restoration of power supply. They have also been directed to coordinate with concerned departments for clearance of roads in case of any blockage/obstruction, waterlogging and pre-placing of necessary emergency equipment at vulnerable/appropriate locations."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq formed a special committee on Saturday to probe the matter of \"misogynist\" remarks passed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Iqbal Afridi during a standing committee meeting a day earlier. In a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Power on Friday, MNA Afridi objected to the attire of a representative from the power utility and called for adherence to the modest dress code followed by female lawmakers. The meeting chaired by Mohammad Idris, Afridi expressed his disapproval, stating: “Chairman, the woman’s attire is inappropriate. There should be a standard operating procedure for dress code in the National Assembly committee.” However, the PTI lawmaker drew sharp rebuke from other ruling parties’ members and attendees present at the session including Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Sherry Rehman and Sindh Government spokesperson Barrister Arsalan Islam Shaikh. Sherry condemned Afridi’s objection to the woman’s attire. “The objection raised by Iqbal Afridi to the woman’s attire in the committee meeting is strongly condemnable. The woman earned her place in that room through her competence and abilities, which should have been respected by all committee members. Women should be evaluated based on their ideas and contributions, not their appearance,” she said in response to Afridi’s comments. “The speaker of the National Assembly should also demand an apology from him. This behaviour is entirely unacceptable at all levels,” she added. A statement issued today said the NA speaker has taken notice of Afridi's remarks and expressed displeasure over his act. The probe committee has been formed to unearth facts related to the incident. The committee led by Federal Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar comprises Naveed Qamar, Amin ul Haque, Malik Muhammad Aamir Dogar and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari. The committee will have the authority to include five women members from the parliamentary parties, the statement said adding that the committee is required to submit a report to the speaker in 15 days."

  "content": "Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar has hinted at more arrests after retired army officers including former chief of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid's were taken into military custody.  The military earlier this week announced that the ex-director-general of ISI was taken into custody by the army over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and a process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated against him. Another three retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest, the army’s media wing said on Thursday. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today (Saturday), Tarar said that the military has its mechanism of self-accountability and recent arrests were done after transparent investigations. \"Be it Saqib or Nisar, the scope of the investigation will expand as things unfold after the arrest of Gen Faiz,\" the minister said while referring to former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar, who was accused of favouring Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan. Recently, rumours on social media claimed that ex-CJP Nisar fled to London and that he could be arrested in the wider inquiry related to the arrest of the ex-spymaster but the former top judge rejected such speculations. Speaking to Geo News, Nisar denounced the recent flurry of social media news that his absence may be linked to the arrest of Gen Faiz and confirmed that he’s in London on the annual planned holidays. Accusing the PTI founding chairman of hatching conspiracies in collusion with the detained former spy chief, Tarar said that the cricketer-turned-politician had fostered the politics of chaos, anarchy and division in the country. \"In collusion with Faiz Hamid, he [Khan] conspired to spread unrest and worked against the integrity of the country. “All these people were involved in the efforts of PTI’s founder to spread chaos and anarchy in the country as the ex-prime minister did politics of manipulation by nexus,\" he said. The minister said that Khan was a mastermind of the plot against the solidarity of the country and that recently arrested persons were his companions. He further asked as to who brought back the terrorists in the country, saying that the the founding chairman of PTI supported the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) militants resettlement to the country.  Tarar said that those who harmed the country's peace would meet their fate and would also be brought to book irrespective of their status. He said like Pakistan Army, other institutions should also start the self-accountability process. On August 12, the military said Gen Faiz had been arrested because there were “multiple instances of violation” of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. “The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,” it added. The military said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company’s owner."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) maverick politician Sher Afzal Marwat announced burying the hatchet with the party leaders after holding a meeting with the incarcerated party founder Imran Khan on Saturday. \"I met Imran Khan today after a gap of three months,\" said Marwat while speaking to journalists outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. He added: \"I shook hands with him and the PTI founder hugged me. There was an exchange of complaints from both sides.\" The PTI lawmaker in the National Assembly, who had been engaged in a tense verbal duel with fellow party leaders for a few months, said that he was putting aside his disagreement with the party following the orders and assurance of Khan. The politico, who had faced termination of his basic party membership over the violation of party discipline earlier this month, announced that only the PTI founder could sack him from the party. Marwat also apologised for his statements against the PTI leaders. Elaborating on his future strategy, the PTI firebrand politician said that he was given responsibility to start preparation for August 22 power show.  He added that PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan gave a clear message that differences within the party should not surface again and all of the leaders are now united. The outspoken politician of the embattled former ruling party has faced wrath from fellow leaders multiple times after delivering blunt and controversial remarks against them and on other issues. Earlier this year, Marwat landed himself in hot water after he had claimed that Saudi Arabia was also allegedly involved in the toppling of the Khan-led government in 2022. The top leadership of the former ruling party not only distanced itself from Marwat’s statement about Riyadh but also served a show-cause notice on the beleaguered senior leader of the PTI. Later in August, the PTI decided to cancel Marwat's basic party membership for \"gross violation/ breach\" of discipline. However, the move divided the Imran-founded party’s top leadership as the notification, endorsed by PTI Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi and a group of leaders, was termed \"fake\" by the party chairman."

  "content": "KARACHI: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Saturday rebuked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and Punjab government for announcing relief in electricity prices for Punjab only. The PML-N supremo on Friday said the Punjab government had prepared a relief package by cutting the power tariff by Rs14 per unit for people consuming up to 500 units of electricity.  \"The relief will be given in the bills of August and September,\" he maintained. The former prime minister said that the provincial government had cut its development fund to provide the relief in utility bills. In response to the PML-N leader's announcement, Kamal said it was an unwarranted announcement as instead of Nawaz, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should have provided relief for the entire country. Hoping the PM will announce relief in power price for all parts of the country, the MQM-P leader rejected the decision to cut the price in Punjab only. “Price for the utility should be cut down by Rs20 a unit nationwide,” he demanded addressing a press conference in Karachi. The announcement, exclusively shedding power price in Punjab, had ensued a feeling of despair in other regions, he said. Meanwhile, Kamal demanded uniform electricity price throughout the country, presenting a solution for bringing the electricity price down. \"Instead of blocking the arteries, we presented the government a solution to resolve the issue of inflated electricity bills,\" the politician said. He claimed Pakistan possessed electricity beyond its requirement as it had the ability to generate more than 45,000 megawatts electricity. However, he said, the country’s transmission lines had the capacity of merely 22-25,000 megawatts. Summing up his suggestion for providing people relief, Kamal said the government should sit down and talk with the 30% local and 50% public independent power producers (IPPs) in this regard, keeping aside the 20% foreign IPPs initially, as they had international agreements. “These IPPs have already made billions of rupees (in terms of charges for their services),” he said. After that, the politician suggested, the government should sit with the foreign IPPs as well and talk to them about the prevailing situation. He proposed privatisation of electricity distribution companies and giving licence to more companies in a region too."

  "content": "The Lahore High Court on Saturday ordered the federal government and the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) to submit their response over the recent internet disruptions faced by millions of Pakistanis. Hearing a petition filed by a citizen named Noman Sarwar against the nationwide internet \"shutdown\", Justice Shakil Ahmad announced the reserved verdict directing all the parties to the case to ensure their representatives' appearance and submit their responses on the next hearing on August 21. The development comes as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. The Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led administration has attributed the issue to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media which is equipped with filters that will block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. The plea, which mentions the federal government, the PTA, the cabinet secretary, the secretary for information and technology (IT), the secretary of interior and and Ministry of Human Rights as respondents, complains that the authorities didn't give any reason for shutting down social media platforms in the country. It also calls for immediate restoration of internet access and the revocation of the Centre's decision to restrict access to it. \"Businesses and every sphere of life are being affected because of the internet’s closure. Shutting down the internet is also a violation of fundamental rights,\" the petition read. A day earlier, Justice Ahmad, while reserving the verdict, had expressed displeasure over the state counsel's non-seriousness and \"lack of knowledge\" on the matter of the nationwide internet service disruptions. The government's move has been under scrutiny from various sections of society for its adverse economic effects. Chairman Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan has warned that online and electronic-related businesses, an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy, are now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival\". Meanwhile, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has said that frequent internet disruptions threaten to hinder the development of a strong digital infrastructure as the backbone of the country's economic development. However, the federal government has defended its decision to enforce an internet firewall terming it a cybersecurity measure \"that every country in the world takes\". \"Look at the cybersecurity attacks being carried out on the country and the world as well. With the evolution of cybersecurity threats, states need to have a better capability to ensure that the threats are [well] responded to,\" Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said on Thursday."

Police said the woman filed a case at the Thekriwala police station, following which they arrested two suspects while hunt for the other suspects was also launched. As per police, the victim, who is a resident of Lahore, came to Faisalabad to meet her friend Muhammad Waseem. The incident took place when the woman stayed at house of the friend’s acquaintance near a bus station, after failing to find a bus, as she wanted to leave for Lahore, they said.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Friday said talks have not been held between Pakistan and India about resuming the bilateral trade.  Addressing the weekly press briefing in Islamabad, the FO spokesperson said Pakistan suspended the bilateral trade with India after its illegal and unilateral measures in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) in 2019. Baloch recalled that several measures including the suspension of trading were taken after the Indian government on August 5, 2019, illegally annexed the IIOJK by revoking the Article 370 of its constitution. \"This situation remains intact,\" she emphasised. The main intent behind observing the day is to expose Indian atrocities and show solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir. Condemning the killing of four Kashmiri youth by Indian occupation forces in Doda district, the spokesperson said the brutal act was yet another example of India's illegal and oppressive steps against the Kashmiri people. She urged the international community to take immediate and decisive action to hold India accountable for its egregious human rights violations in IIOJK and take steps to protect the rights and freedoms of Kashmiri people. On violations of the border, the FO spokesperson urged the interim Afghan government to exercise restraint and avoid unprovoked acts against the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. She said this while responding to a question about rising incidents of cross-border firing and a recent clash between the border forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan near the Torkham border crossing. Earlier this week, security forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan exchanged heavy fire after the former objected to the construction of a controversial checkpost near the border by the Afghans. The cross-border firing incident resulted in the closure of the border for all types of movement. The FO spokesperson said: “First, I would not like to go into history of such border violations from the Afghan side. However, as you know, the recent incident was very unfortunate when on the 12th of August, Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at the Torkham border.” Pakistani forces responded appropriately in self-defence, she added. “We urge the Afghan authorities to exercise restraint and avoid unprovoked acts against Pakistan-Afghanistan border. They must understand that Pakistani forces will always defend their territory.” Baloch further said that they remain ready to resolve any misunderstandings through established diplomatic channels. “I would also like to underline that the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is multifaceted, and it encompasses various aspects of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. This is a historic relationship, so seeing this relationship from a narrow prism would not be advisable.” The spokesperson said Pakistan has consistently raised its concerns about the presence of terrorist hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan. She said Pakistan expects the Afghan authorities to take effective and robust action against the terrorist groups. The spokesperson strongly rejected allegations about Pakistan's role in the ouster of Sheikh Hasina Wajid saying there is absolutely no truth in them. She said Pakistan believes that the people of Bangladesh have the capacity to settle their affairs and determine their future. Baloch strongly denounced the storming of Al-Aqsa mosque by hundreds of extremist settlers led by office bearers of Israeli occupation authorities. She said the desecration of one of Islam's holiest sites and obstruction of the rights of worshippers have deeply hurt the sentiments of Muslims worldwide. This act is a violation of the Geneva Convention and blatant disregard of multiple UNSC resolutions. The spokesperson called upon the international community especially the UN Security Council to take immediate action to end the serious and repeated transgressions against the sanctity of holy sites in Jerusalem, protect the Islamic character of Al-Aqsa and ensure the freedom of worship of the Palestinian people."

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Pakistan has detected the first positive patient with the monkeypox virus, Director General Health and Services of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr Salim Khan confirmed to The News on Friday. The KP government has established an isolation facility for suspected Mpox cases in the Police Services Hospital in Peshawar. There were, however, conflicting reports about the number of patients diagnosed with the monkeypox virus. DG Health and Services Dr Khan had earlier told The News that two patients had been diagnosed with the Mpox virus and they had a travel history of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He stated that samples of the third patient had been sent to the National Institute of Health laboratory in Islamabad for confirmation. “I can confirm to you two positive cases of monkeypox while samples of the third patient have been sent to the NIH laboratory in Islamabad and results are awaited. All these three patients returned from UAE and are quarantined,” said Dr Salim Khan, DG Health and Services Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Later, the Health Department announced that the third patient had also been confirmed positive for the Mpox virus at the NIH. However, Dr Irshad Roghani, Director of public Health, later issued a statement saying that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had reported only a single patient of Mpox, saying it was the first case of 2024, both in Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the two other positive cases were reported in 2023. The officials of the KP Health Department had earlier stated that two positive patients of Mpox were detected upon their arrival from UAE in the Bacah Khan International Airport in Peshawar. They said that both of them were quarantined. Senior officials of the Health Department told The News on condition of anonymity that there were some instructions from high diplomatic officials that the name of the country should not be mentioned if the passengers are diagnosed with the disease upon their arrival from those countries. Dr Roghani stated in a statement that the patient diagnosed with the Mpox virus had a travel history from Saudi Arabia. However, Sajid Hussain, a spokesman for the Federal Health Ministry, told The News that only one patient from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had tested positive for the Mpox virus. He however said that the patient had a travel history of UAE. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the recent outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern after a new variant of the virus has been identified. The health department officials in Peshawar have stated that the patients were quarantined. Upon investigation, no patient was quarantined in any health facility of the provincial capital city. The story of the first positive patient is also very interesting. District Health Officer Mardan, Dr Javed Iqbal told The News that the patient was admitted to the Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar for the treatment of his fractured leg. “This patient had recently returned from Saudi Arabia and had settled in Mardan. He was taken to the Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar for his fractured leg where he had felt some skin issues and was sent to the Dermatology Department of the same hospital for their opinion,” said Dr Iqbal. He said the dermatologists in KTH felt something serious in his skin and they took his samples and sent them to the National Institute of Health laboratory in Islamabad where he was diagnosed with the monkeypox virus. Sajjad Khan, a spokesman for KTH, said the doctors in KTH had properly explained to him and his attendants about the disease and its impact on other people and were advised to quarantine him. The patient was discharged from the hospital and was taken to their home in Manga town of Mardan district. However, Dr Iqbal and his team visited their home in Manga, they found it locked from the outside and the neighbours informed them that they had gone to Lower Dir district. Since the patient had originally belonged to the Lower Dir district of the Malakand region, and settled in Mardan, the officials noted that they might have disappeared from the media. DHO Mardan Dr Iqbal said they had approached their colleagues in the Health Department in Dir district, but they couldn’t trace him even in Dir. He said their basic concern was that the patient to be properly quarantined so that he couldn’t infect others. Meanwhile, the Health Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Syed Qasim Ali Shah, has expressed serious concern over the recent confirmation of an Mpox case in Mardan. In response, the minister has directed the Department of Health to take immediate and effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He instructed Dr Roghani, to prioritise surveillance, contact tracing, and the monitoring of the patient's movements. Shah also highlighted that border health services teams have been deployed at the Pak-Afghan border and airports to ensure the screening of all incoming passengers, particularly those suspected of carrying the symptoms. Providing further details, Dr Roghani confirmed that the first Mpox case of 2024 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been reported in a patient from Mardan. The patient is experiencing mild symptoms and has been quarantined at home. Contact tracing efforts are currently underway, with the Department of Health monitoring those who have come into contact with the patient. Dr Roghani added that isolation wards are being set up for Mpox patients, and screening of all suspected travellers from abroad, particularly from Gulf countries, is ongoing. The Department of Health has already issued an advisory for the public and healthcare workers, and WHO has declared Mpox an emergency. Since 2022, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has confirmed three cases of Mpox. Two patients have already recovered, while samples from the current active case have been sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) for further analysis. The WHO on Wednesday declared the outbreak in Africa a public health emergency of international concern or PHEIC after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. A PHEIC is WHO's highest level of alert. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in Congo since the current outbreak began in January 2023."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet Committee on Institutional Reforms Friday recommended curtailing 150,000 vacant positions, banning contingency recruitment, and outsourcing non-core services like cleaning, janitorial work, which will gradually phase out many positions up to grade 16.  In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for reducing public sector size and expenses, the committee, chaired by the finance minister, presented its recommendations for right-sizing in the federal government departments.  The body also proposed the government curtail 150,000 vacant positions and ban contingency recruitment. The Ministry of Finance was asked to oversee the cash balances of other federal ministries. The committee provided a detailed briefing on recommended reforms for five federal ministries: the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions, Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, the Ministry of Industry and Production, and the Ministry of National Health Services. The committee proposed merging the Ministry of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan with the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions (Safron). The proposal also involves closing 28 institutions across these five ministries, transferring the Ministry of Privatisation and some other ministries to federal units, and merging 12 institutions within these ministries. Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz directed the authorities concerned that these proposed reforms should be approved by the federal Cabinet and that a comprehensive plan for their implementation be presented. He emphasised that curtailing government expenditure was his top priority. \"The goal of the government’s institutional reforms was to lessen the burden on the national treasury and enhance the quality of services provided to the public,\" he said. The premier ordered that the institutions failing to demonstrate adequate public service performance and burdening the national exchequer should be either terminated immediately or privatised without delay. He also vowed to personally oversee the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA), an organisation supporting small and medium enterprises, and directed that SMEDA be brought under the Prime Minister’s Office. Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, various other federal ministers and relevant senior government officials attended the meeting.

  "content": "Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Sherry Rehman and Sindh Government spokesperson Barrister Arsalan Islam Shaikh on Friday lamented Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Iqbal Afridi’s \"misogynistic\" remarks targeting a woman’s dressing, demanding an apology from him. MNA Afridi raised an objection over the attire of a woman during the National Assembly's Standing Committe on Power's meeting. He then received criticism from other members and attendees present at the session. Responding to Afridi, Senator Rehman said that he should apologise for his behaviour. \"This behaviour is reprehensible and falls under the line of harassment. The PTI should make its MNA apologise.\" She, while addressing Afridi directly, said: “ No one has the right to comment over a woman’s attire. Don’t make a patriarchal society, who made you a policeman of clothes?” Additionally, the information minister also condemned the act of the PTI lawmaker, saying: “Harassing women is not acceptable in any condition. The Tehreek-e-Insaf has become tehreek-e-na-insaf [unjust movement] for women.” “Women face so many difficulties in our society. The PTI should take action against Iqbal Afridi,” he said, adding, “Real justice is that the party membership of Iqbal Afridi should be suspended.” He further added: “This is the PTI’s fascism, which is coming out openly.” Parallel to this, the Sindh government spokesperson also said: “There was nothing inappropriate in the clothes of the woman that should have been objected to. Women have full freedom in our society.”   Referring to the PTI MNA, he added: “Iqbal Afridi should be careful of his gaze, his objection over the woman’s clothing does not make sense.” He added, “Iqbal Afridi should apologise to the woman for his act.”"

  "description": "In the wake of internet disruptions across the country and speculation over firewall installations, State Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said on Sunday that reports suggesting that the internet was being throttled by the government were “completely false.” On Thursday, Khawaja said that the government had ordered the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other relevant bodies to submit a report after citizens in various cities of Pakistan claimed they had been facing internet connectivity issues. Her statement came a day after the business community and internet service providers alleged that the government’s heightened efforts to monitor internet traffic had resulted in a significant nationwide slowdown of services, leading to losses. On Saturday, the Lahore High Court summoned representatives from the federal government, the information ministry, and the PTA on August 21 over internet disruptions. Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad today, Khawaja acknowledged the recent frustration among the public regarding internet issues. “I want to reassure the public that the internet has neither been shut down nor slowed down by the state,” she said. “Reports suggesting that the internet was being throttled are completely false. The issue was limited to a few services on certain apps not downloading, which led a large segment of the population to start using VPNs.”            View this post on Instagram              She explained that when a large number of people use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or local caches and connect directly to live servers, it puts additional pressure on those servers, which can ultimately slow down the internet. “Even when you use VPNs on your phones, you may notice that your device automatically slows down. This is because the increased traffic exerts pressure, which led to the internet slowing down for a few days,” she said. “I can say under oath that the government neither shut down nor slowed down the internet.” Khawaja claimed that the government had been “working tirelessly” to resolve the issue and has held meetings with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecom companies. A meeting, she said, had also been scheduled with the PTA next week to “ensure that users in the country do not face similar problems again.” She reiterated that there was “no truth to the rumor that the government is throttling the internet to suppress dissent.” The minister also urged citizens to “speak responsibly” about Pakistan since the internet was a “critical resource, and we must handle discussions about it with care.” Irresponsible talk can damage the industry, deter investment, hurt freelancers, and negatively impact Pakistan’s perception abroad, she said. She further acknowledged the country’s challenges related to the health of the telecom sector born from constrained revenues. “The government is committed to investing in digitalization, developing policies, and allocating budgets to promote this industry,” Khawaja said. ‘Govt setting up a firewall blown out of proportion’ Earlier this week, Khawaja acknowledged the public’s concerns and said that the internet should never be slow and that news about a firewall being installed by the government was “blown out of proportion”. “We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher [internet] speed are underway.” The minister added that the government setting up a firewall had been blown out of proportion, adding that it was a routine exercise across the globe to enhance internet security. “There was a web-management system being operated by the government before too, which is now being upgraded,” she had said. “It is the right of the government to [take such measures] given the cyber security attacks that this country has to go through.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday formed a fact-finding committee to probe the matter regarding comments made by MNA Mohammad Iqbal Afridi concerning the attire of a female officer of K-Electric during a meeting of the Power Division a day before on Friday. The committee would include Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar who is law minister, MNAs Syed Naveed Qamar, Syed Aminul Haq, Malik Mohammad Aamir Dogar and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri. A statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat noted that the committee might also co-opt five women members from parliamentary parties. The committee was directed to submit its report within 15 days.      In a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Power on Friday, PTI MNA Mohammad Iqbal Afridi sparked controversy by objecting to the attire of a high-ranking K-Electric official, leading to widespread criticism from fellow lawmakers and political figures.  CEO says remarks by certain individuals in authority were not in line with decorum of elected position  The incident occurred during the committee’s meeting where Afridi objected to the clothing of the female K-Electric representative after she had delivered a briefing and exited the room. Although Afridi was not a member of the Power Committee, he was in attendance as the lawmaker representing NA-27 (Khyber) to discuss issues related to loadshedding in Karachi and the former Fata region. Iqbal Afridi described the woman’s attire as “objectionable” and argued that standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be established regarding women’s clothing in official settings. He further asserted that such attire could negatively influence societal norms, particularly the behaviour and perceptions of children. The committee’s chairman, Mohammad Idrees, who presided over the meeting, later apologised for the incident. “It was inappropriate to object to her attire,” Idrees said, acknowledging that Afridi’s remarks may have stemmed from a misunderstanding. Afridi’s comments were met with strong backlash from other political leaders. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman condemned his objection as “regrettable and condemnable,” questioning why male MNAs felt entitled to police women’s clothing. Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar also criticised Afridi’s remarks, calling on the PTI to take disciplinary action against him. Tarar stated that harassment of women was “unacceptable under any circumstances” and described the incident as an example of “PTI’s fascism coming out in the open”. The incident has sparked a broader conversation on gender equality and the rights of women in professional environments, with many urging political parties to address and prevent such behaviour among their ranks. Meanwhile, in a statement on X, formerly twitter, K-Electric CEO Moonis Alvi said: “KE was proud of the women whose professionalism and competence drove us to chart new frontiers in a traditionally male-dominated energy sector every day.” “Unfortunately, the recent remarks by certain individuals in authority made about a colleague of ours in their absence are neither in line with the decorum of an elected position nor with the values we hold as a company and should uphold as a society,” he said. As an equitable, enabling employer, we are committed to breaking the bias and will always stand against any and all forms of discrimination and harassment, Mr Alvi added.

  "description": "• Information minister says scope of probe against Faiz will be widened, urges other institutions to follow military’s example of ‘self-accountability’ • Imran claims ex-ISI chief’s transfer to Peshawar corps was ‘part of conspiracy’ against his govt • PML-N senator says talks with PTI only if it shows seriousness ISLAMABAD: The government on Saturday accused PTI founder Imran Khan of masterminding a political conspiracy, along with a retired general and other characters, to sow anarchy and disharmony in the country, with the information minister hinting that the ambit of the probe against Gen Faiz Hameed and his other “co-conspirators” would be widened in days to come. Meanwhile, just days after distancing himself from the former spymaster, who is currently facing court martial proceedings, Mr Khan seemed to endorse claims that he and the retired general were close, saying the latter’s transfer to the Peshawar corps was part of the conspiracy hatched against the PTI government. In a presser on Saturday, the infor­ma­tion minister said that in the wake of Gen Faiz Hameed’s arrest, the army has conducted transparent investigations as they have their own mechanism of internal accountability, adding that they believed in self-accountability. Referring to the arrests made in this regard, and hinting at further action in the days to come, the information minister claimed that Imran Khan had conspired with these people to spread anarchy in the country. “This was a political alliance, led by the PTI founder, which was linked with Gen Faiz and other accomplices,” he said, adding that the ambit of the investigation would definitely widen. “No matter if someone is Saqib or Nisar, things will proceed transparently,” he said, referring to former CJP Saqib Nisar, who the PML-N accuses of propping up the PTI regime and targeting their political opponents. Mr Tarar alleged that evidence was surfacing, which showed that the PTI founder was “in contact” with these conspirators — at the time of the vote of no-confidence, and even after his incarceration — and his messaging continued back-and-forth with this “unholy political alliance”. He stressed that other institutions should also practice the same self-accountability that the army had demonstrated. Faiz’s transfer ‘plot against PTI’ Meanwhile, talking to media persons after the hearing of the £190m corruption case in Adiala jail, Imran Khan said he believed the transfer of retired Gen Faiz Hameed from his post as head of Inter-Services Intelli­gence to Peshawar corps commander was part of a conspiracy hatched to topple his regime. Mr Khan claimed that this was done by former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, at the behest of Nawaz Sharif. He maintained that the PTI was still demanding a judicial inquiry into the incidents of May 9, however, the establishment appeared reluctant. He also alleged that efforts are being made to secure a two-third majority for the ruling coalition, and an extension for the incumbent Supreme Court chief justice. On Friday, Mr Khan also announced his intention to run for the position of chancellor of Oxford University while in prison. ‘No talks until PTI serious’ PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui has indicated that his party would no longer “repeatedly call out” to the PTI for talks, while reiterating that the latter needed to approach it with seriousness. In an interview with DawnNews, Mr Siddiqui said: “We repeatedly said ‘fine, you have entered the House — in whatever way you have — then at least sit together on that level and try to solve your matters’”. “[But] they do not want to talk, and we have also thought that now we will not repeatedly call out to them from our rooftops that ‘come, talk to us’,” the politician added. However, he went on to say that the PML-N and its coalition partners would “consider whether to open the door or not” for talks with the PTI if the latter “approached it seriously”. The senator stressed that holding a dialogue depended on when the PTI would have realised that “we shouldn’t have talks with the army but with politicians”. He added that perhaps Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chief of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and leader of the opposition alliance, would be “successful in making [the PTI] understand” that a dialogue among political parties was needed. Malik Asad in Islamabad also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2024 "

  "description": "PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has screened close contacts of a Mardan resident, who recently tested positive for mpox at the Public Health Reference Laboratory at the Khyber Medical University here. “The screening exercise didn’t find the symptoms of the viral infection in the male mpox patient’s family members, including parents, wife, two children, four sisters and three brothers,” director (public health) at the directorate-general health services Dr Irshad Ali Roghani told Dawn. He also said 30 people checked in the neighbourhood were also asymptomatic. “The incubation period for mpox is 21 days, so we’ll continue to monitor those people,” he said.  Minister examines facilities at isolation ward in Peshawar hospital  The director said the 34-year-old villager, who was diagnosed with mpox three days ago, had been isolated at home. He said he visited the family and examined care provided to the patient. Dr Roghani said the patient’s specimens had been sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad for genetic sequencing whose results would be available within a week. Meanwhile, provincial health minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah visited the public sector Services Hospital in the provincial capital and examined arrangements at a six-bed isolation ward set up for suspected mpox cases. DG (health) Dr Salim Khan accompanied him. Medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Niaz Mohammad informed them that the ward could isolate suspected cases to prevent the spread of infection. “This isolation ward is has emergency medications, oxygen concentrators, and other necessary equipment for managing mpox, which currently has no specific treatment. Patients require symptomatic care for which we’ve everything at our disposal,” he said. The MS said the confirmed mpox cases required medicines for fever and intravenous fluids for rehydration. He said doctors and paramedics would be present at the ward round the clock to ensure patients are admitted and managed without delay,“ he said. Also in the day, DG (health) Dr Salim Khan visited the Bacha Khan International Airport in Peshawar and met Dr Fareezuddin, the health officer in charge of the Border Health Services. They discussed the situation after the confirmation of the mpox case. A screening area has already been established at the airport, with the BHS staff re-enforced with 15 health workers from the health department. Director of the Public Health Reference Lab Dr Yasar Yousafzai said genetic sequencing would determine the virus strain in patients. “Clade 1 is generally more dangerous, but we have yet to determine the specific Clade in this case and whether it represents a further mutated variant of Clade 1,” he said. Dr Yasar said the PHRL, established by the health department, had been carrying out all tests for notifiable diseases in collaboration with the NIH and the World Health Organisation. He said the health department had already issued guidelines to hospitals to inform doctors and paramedics about the symptoms of suspected patients and how to collect, store and transport specimens to the PHRL for testing. The official said the only confirmed mpox case reported this year was identified by Khyber Teaching Hospital dermatologist Dr Mehran Khan. He said last year, the province recorded two confirmed mpox cases and both of them were referred by dermatologists. Dr Yasar said the government was focusing its attention on strengthening surveillance to ensure that suspected mpox patients were tested and isolated in case of confirmation. He said prevention was the main strategy being followed by the government. Dermatologists said mpox was a “self-limiting” disease whose patients usually recovered within weeks without major complications. They, however, warned that the patients, who were immunocompromised like those with HIV/Aids, were an exception. The dermatologists said since transmission of mpox required close contact with body fluids, it was more common in men having sex with men. They added that in that group of people, HIV might be more common, but generally, it was unlikely to cause a major disruptive outbreak. Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: The bodies of five men, which were found hanging from electricity poles in Dalbandin town of Chagai district a day earlier, were identified on Saturday. However, no one has claimed responsibility for the killings so far. “All five victims are Afghan nationals and re­­sidents of Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan,” Muham­mad Jawad, an official from the Shah Fahad Bin Sultan Hospital, told Dawn, adding that the bodies were identified with the help of Muhammad Yahya, a resident of Girdi Jangle, an Afghan refugee camp in Chagai district, who visited the hospital where the bodies were kept. The deceased were identified as Rozi Khan,  Rehmat Ullah, Sami Ullah, Agha Wali, and Sardar Wali. The bodies were shifted to Quetta. Police investigating the killings suspect that the five victims may be the same group who appeared in a viral video on social media, making confessio­nal statements about the murder of Murad Note­zai, a prominent leader of the Iran-based banned militant organisation Jaish al-Adl. The militant group, which operates in the Sis­tan-Baluchestan region of Iran, may have kidnap­ped and executed these people, possibly in retaliation for the killing of their leader, sources said. However, officials and independent sources have yet to confirm whether the bodies found are of the same individuals who appeared in the video, or if they are unrelated individuals killed due to personal vendettas. “We are investigating the incident to determine whether the deceased are the same individuals who made confessional statements in the video or if they are unrelated individuals,” a senior police officer said.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) has warned of heavy rainfall in northeastern and southern parts of Punjab, which is likely to flood the Chenab River. The NDMA’s National Eme­rgency Operation Cen­tre said it is monitoring the “well marked low pressure system” in these regions. Dr Tayab Shah, who leads NDMA’s risk assessment unit, said that the system was also active in western and northeastern parts of Balochistan as well as northern Sindh. Under the system, rainfall is likely in Shakargarh, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Multan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan districts of Punjab. Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kohlu and Kalat divisions of Balochistan are also exp­ected to receive the rainfall along with the entire northern belt of Sindh — Ghotki, Kashmore, and Qambar-Shahdadkot. Zahra Hassan, the GIS head at NDMA, said according to the projection, the current spell would be stronger in the northeastern side of the country, affecting Noro­wal, Sialkot and Lahore with heavy rainfall. In south Punjab, the system would affect Baha­walpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Multan Divisions. Balochistan’s Kalat, Ziarat and Zhob districts would be affected by rainfall, while Nawabshah and Sukkar in upper Sindh would also witness similar weather. The official also confirmed that the Chenab River would be in a state of medium-level flood till August 19. The NDMA has warned provincial disaster management authorities, irrigation departments and district administrations to devise safety and mitigation strategies. They have also been advised to ensure “enhanced alert level” and monitor the situation. The at-risk population from low-lying and flood-prone areas should be timely evacuated, with forewarnings for farmers and cattle herders to move away from areas adjacent to rivers, their tributaries and nullahs, the advisory cautioned. The Pakistan Meteoro­logical Department (PMD) has updated its weather advisory, indicating a shift in the monsoon system from Karachi and lower Sindh towards central and upper Sindh and Balochistan, APP reported. According to an alert issued on Saturday, the likelihood of heavy rain in Karachi has diminished, with a likelihood of light to moderate showers. Previously, the PMD had predicted thunderstorms for Karachi within the next 24 hours. Jacobabad, Larkana, Dadu, Shikarpur, Ghotki and Sukkur are expected to receive heavy rainfall. The PMD has forecast that this weather system may continue to affect Sindh until the morning of Aug 19. In light of the weather forecast, the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) has warned passengers of intermittent rain in Islamabad, Peshawar, Kot Momin, Dera Ismail Khan, Swat, and Thakot. A NHMP spokesman on Saturday said travellers should exercise extreme caution while driving in rainy conditions. Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Barrister Saif claims three-member committee probed allegation against former cabinet member • Ex-C&W minister Shakeel has accused provincial govt of ‘embezzlement’ • Sher Afzal Marwat meets Imran in Adiala ISLAMABAD: The provincial minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been fired for alleged corruption on the directions of PTI founder Imran Khan, the adviser to KP Chief Minister on Information, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif claimed on Saturday. Meanwhile, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, has accused the provincial government of embezzlement. He also claimed to have “resigned” from the cabinet and insisted he was not removed. Mr Saif, who met the PTI founding chairman in Adiala Jail on Saturday, said detailed discussions were held on the decision to remove Mr Shakeel from the cabinet. “Following the PTI founder’s instructions, a [video] message was conveyed to workers, officials, and cabinet members,” he said. Mr Saif said a committee, formed by the PTI founder, had investigated the remove corruption allegations against Mr Shakeel. Mr Khan “personally selected” the committee members — Shah Farman, Qazi Muhammad Anwar and Musaddiq Abbasi — and they compiled the report based on all statements and evidence, Mr Saif said. After the report was presented to the chief minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, the process of dismissing the minister was carried out. While sharing the details of his meeting with the incarcerated PTI founder, Mr Saif claimed he expressed concerns over corruption in the provincial government. “The PTI founder emphasised that there would be zero tolerance for corruption, and it was in this context that the committee was formed.” Mr Saif said the same committee would also compile reports after investigations in the future, and decisions would be made based on them. He added that he was conveying Mr Khan’s message to party workers to submit any complaints or concerns to the committee. The PTI founder also expressed displeasure over attempts to create an impression of divisions within PTI on social media. He has directed workers not to be part of any group and “stay united”. “The PTI founder also instructed that those attempting to create discord and factionalism within the party should be thwarted,” Mr Saif said while quoting the incarcerated leader. Diverging from manifesto Mr Shakeel said he has “resigned” due to differences with the provincial government, which he accused of “bad governance and ignoring PTI’s manifesto”. In his resignation letter addressed to the governor — which also circulated on social media on Friday night, Mr Shakeel noted he was quitting the cabinet position with “great disappointment”. Listing the grounds for his resignation, he claimed that the provincial government has compromised on the basic principles and commitments made by the PTI with the voters during the election campaign. “The people voted in favour of PTI on its anti-establishment stand, but the provincial government has taken a step backwards from its principled stance,” he said. The former minister also claimed bad governance and corruption “at all levels of the provincial government” destroyed the image of the PTI in the eyes of party workers. “I offer myself before accountability at all forums.” Meeting with Marwat Meanwhile, PTI MNA Sher Afzal Khan Marwat also met with the in Adiala Jail on Saturday. This was their first meeting in three months. Mr Marwat, the firebrand PTI leader, was removed from the party’s core committee in the wake of infighting, as many members were unhappy with his unrestrained attitude and habit of openly speaking against his party colleagues. After meeting Mr Khan, Mr Marwat told journalists outside Adiala Jail that “there was an exchange of complaints from both sides”. He claimed that he was putting aside his disagreements with the party, following orders and assurances from the party founder.

  "description": "• MQM leader says entire country deserves such relief, terms announcement from Nawaz ‘unwarranted’ • Maryam asks Kamal to approach Sindh govt for subsidy, says Punjab govt footing the bill itself • Jamaat chief tries to claim credit, says relief prompted by their Rawalpindi sit-in KARACHI: After the PML-N-led Punjab government subsidised electricity for consumers using up to 500 units, its ally in the Centre, the MQM-P, on Saturday kicked up a fuss about the Rs45 billion subsidy, saying the Punjab-centric incentive would give rise to ‘despair’ in other parts of the country. In a press conference on Friday, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced that the provincial government would provide relief of Rs14 per unit in electricity bills up to 500 units for August and September. The move was largely seen as an attempt to placate PML-N’s vote bank in Punjab. Taking exception, MQM-P leader Mus­tafa Kamal questioned the announcem­e­­nt made by Nawaz Sharif, calling it ‘un­­warranted’. Instead of the elder Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should have provided relief in power bills for the entire country, he maintained. According to Mr Kamal, with the kind of inflation the masses had been facing, the federal government should have announced a relief of at least Rs20 per unit for the entire country. “The announcement only for Punjab would only ensure a feeling of despair in other parts of the country,” he said. The MQM lawmaker demanded uniform power tariffs across the country and also claimed to have a solution to Pakistan’s electricity woes. “…I assure you with all due confidence that we have a solution to this problem and we have shared it with the government,” he claimed. He said Pakistan’s power generation system had the capacity to produce more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity, but the transmission lines could sustain only 22-25,000MW which needed to be fixed at the earliest. The reservations aired by the MQM leader in the presser were swiftly responded to by CM Maryam Nawaz through her social media account. The CM rejected the impression that the relief was the federal government’s move and clai­med it was her administration’s decision and the provincial kitty would foot the bill. She even dared the Sindh government of PPP to come up with the same initiative for its people. “Dear Mustafa Bhai, Punjab has given this relief to its people not for free but it has paid huge amount for this,” she posted on X [formerly Twitter] with a screenshot of Mr Kamal’s presser criticising the Punjab-only relief. “For this, Punjab has paid Rs45 billion from its annual budget. I would be happy if you talk to the Sindh government and it also provides the same relief to its people. Thanks,” the PML-N leader quipped. JI claims credit As the move divided coalition partners, the Jamaat-i-Islami claimed Punjab government’s decision materialised due to their party’s lengthy Rawalpindi sit-in. Addressing a press conference at his party’s headquarters, JI chief Naeemur Rehman also announced “a shutter-down strike” in collaboration with traders on August 28 against the inflated electricity bills and inflation. “When we called off the [Rawalpindi] sit-in, the Jamaat and the government both agreed on certain terms with commitment from the government that these all terms would be implemented within 45 days,” he said. “…Jamaat sticks to its demands and if they aren’t met, our options are open. We would be in the streets exercising every legal and constitutional right for the relief of a common man.” “The Sindh budget clocked in at three trillion, with the inclusion of Rs1,885 billion or almost 62 per cent by the federal government. Against this backdrop, the PPP government in Sindh can easily spare a few billion to provide relief to the masses,” said Hafiz Naeem about such relief in Sindh. Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2024 "

  "description": "• PM orders tighter border screening, directs NCOC to remain vigilant • Over 18,700 cases detected in Africa since January ISLAMABAD: Health authorities informed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday that there is no evidence of local transmission of mpox in Pakistan and that a comprehensive strategy has been formulated to protect citizens from the disease. During a meeting focu­sed on measures to prevent the spread of mpox, the prime minister instructed officials to implement rigorous screening procedures at all airports, seaports and border crossings. He also directed the Border Health Services to maintain comprehensive surveillance of the situation. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been spre­a­ding in several countries, prompting the World Hea­lth Organisation (WHO) earlier this week to declare it a public health emergency of international concern — the agency’s highest alert. PM Shehbaz ordered the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) to remain vigilant and assess the situation daily. He also called for the provision of all necessary equipment and kits to evaluate the mpox virus. The meeting was atte­nded by the PM’s Coordi­na­tor on National Health Ser­v­i­ces Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bha­rath, Federal Secretary of Nat­ional Hea­lth Nadeem Mehbub, Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chair­man Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik, chief secretaries, the Islamabad chief commissioner, and other senior officials. In a statement, the prime minister emphasised the im­p­ortance of strengthening coordination among the provincial governm­ents, as well as the adminis­trations of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kash­mir. He also directed the launch of a comprehensive public awar­eness campaign and hinted at receiving weekly briefings on the mpox situation. During the meeting, officials informed the participants that a case of mpox had been detected in the Mardan district. The infected individual had recently returned from a Gulf country where he was employed. He was quarantined upon diagnosis and his condition was reported to be stable, the meeting was informed. Officials assured the prime minister that no local transmission of mpox has been detected in Pakistan. Following the WHO’s declaration on Aug 14, the NCOC issued a national advisory and necessary instructions have been disseminated. The federal and provincial governments, along with Islam­abad, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, have allocated isolation wards and designated hospital beds for potential mpox cases. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been tasked with monitoring flights arriving from affected countries. Later, the prime minister’s coordinator on health, Dr Mukhtar, told a press conference that PM Shehbaz had directed relevant authorities to take all possible steps to prevent the virus from spreading. Dr Mukhtar noted that only one mpox case had been reported in Pakistan, with the patient originally visiting the hospital for an unrelated condition but was later diagnosed with mpox. He added that mpox symptoms typically appear within four to 10 days and often include a skin rash. He advised passengers arriving from countries with mpox cases to remain vigilant and seek medical attention if symptoms develop. Cases in Africa Meanwhile, the African Union health agency said on Saturday that a total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox have been reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in one week alone. The figure accounts for three strains of the virus, of which one is the new, more deadly and more transmissible Clade 1b, which prompted the WHO to declare an international health emergency. To date, 3,101 confirmed and 15,636 suspected cases have been reported from 12 African Union member states, resulting in 541 deaths — a fatality rate of 2.89 per cent, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement. The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where the new Clade 1b strain was first detected in September 2023, has reported 1,005 cases (222 confirmed, 783 suspected) and 24 deaths in one week. All 26 provinces in the DRC, home to some 100 million people, have reported cases. Neighbouring Burundi reported 173 cases — 39 confirmed and 134 suspected — which marks a rise of 75pc in one week. More cases have been reported since the beginning of the year than all of 2023, which saw a total of 14,383 cases, according to the Africa CDC. The first cases of the mpox outside of Africa were recorded this week, in Sweden and Pakistan. The WHO will soon publish its first recommendations by its emergency committee and, along with NGOs, has also called for the ramping up of vaccine production. Mpox is a viral disease that can spread from animals to humans, but also human-to-human thro­ugh sexual or close physical contact. Symptoms include fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions. The Clade 1b causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous variants caused localised lesions around the mouth, face or genitals. The disease was first detected in humans in the DRC in 1970. The deadlier Clade 1 has been endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa for decades.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has fixed Aug 22 for hearing the Punjab government’s urgent application seeking omissions of certain portions from the verdict in the Mubarak Ahmad Sani case which was announced on July 24. Filed through the prosecutor general of Punjab on Saturday, the application was instantaneously fixed for hearing before a three-judge bench consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. According to the application, some leading clerics and members of parliament have requested the federal government to approach the apex court and highlight some portions of the judgement, which merit correction. The three-page application mentions that paragraph 49 needs omission and correction since the July 24 judgement had held that the verdict of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) in the 1985 case of Mujib-ur-Rehman versus government of Pakistan, and the Supreme Court’s 1993 verdict in Zaheer-ud-Din versus the State case were binding precedents and that the apex court has not deviated from these binding precedents in its Feb 6 judgement.  Three-member bench headed by CJP will take up the matter on Aug 22  The application explains that some observations and findings contained in some other paragraphs of the judgement appeared to be an accidental error being contrary to the precedents as mentioned by the top court. Thus such portions of the judgement in the review petition merit correction. The application by Punjab’s prosecutor general was moved under Section 561A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) 1898 read with order 33 Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 and Sections 152 and 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and other enabling provisions of law for amendment to the July 24 judgement. The religious scholars, who requested the federal government for approaching the apex court, are Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani of Jamia Darul Uloom Karachi, Mufti Munibur Rehman of Darul Uloom Naeemia Karachi, Maulana Zahidur Rashdi from Gujranwala, Mufti Sher Muhammad Khan from Bhera, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Jamaat-i-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, Jamiat Ahl-i- Hadith Pakistan emir Prof Sajid Mir, Maulana Anwarul Haq of Darul Uloom Haqqania Akora Khattak, Chief Khatib KP Maulana Tayyab Qureshi, Syed Jawwad Ali Naqvi of Jamia Arwatul Wasqa Lahore, Sahibzada Abul Khair Muhammad Zubair of the Milli Yakjehti Council and Maulana Muhammad Ijaz Mustafa, emir, Majlis Tahafuz Khatm-i-Nubuwat Karachi. In its Aug 17 judgement, the Supreme Court had accepted a previous Punjab government’s plea to revisit its Feb 6 order in the Mubarak Ahmad Sani case and declared that the right to profess religion and religious freedom, as ensured by the Constitution, was subject to the law, morality and public order. The judgement had emphasised that complete faith in the finality of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) was the very foundation of Islam — a belief without which nobody can be described as a Muslim.

He was one of the people on board the ill-fated inaugural PIA flight from Karachi and London, which crashed near Cairo airport on May 20, 1965. The flight was supposed to stop over in Dhahran, Cairo and Geneva.  The plane had 128 passengers and crew on board, of whom only six had survived.  Mr Siddique had been living in London for a long time. According to family sources, he is survived by a son and a daughter.

  "description": "QUETTA: While the federal and provincial information commissions have completed three terms, the body has yet to be formed in Balochistan despite three years since the law was passed. The commission was suppo­sed to be formed under the Ba­­lochistan Right To Informa­t­ion Act, which was passed in 2021. This was said during the inaugural programme of the Right to Information project by Aid Balochistan on Saturday. The event was attended by political and social leaders, bureaucrats, journalists, and lawyers.  They stated that the implementation of the right to information law had yet to materialise in Balochistan.  Politicians, activists say access to information vital to ensure transparency  Implementing this law is a fundamental right of citizens, and the right to information is essential in maintaining transparency in the use of public funds, they said. The rules of business for the commission have been framed and the appointment of information commissioners on merit is urgently needed, the speakers said. The political parties’ representatives emphasised the importance of implementing the bill, which they said would ensure better use of public money and encourage welfare projects. They stated that the dream of Balochistan’s development can be realised only by enforcing the RTI law. Adil Jahangir, the execut­ive director of Aid Balochis­tan, said that through access to information law, public participation in government’s decision-making can be ensured. Information regarding ongoing projects in health, education, and other departments will also become accessible due to the RTI law. Senior journalist Mir Beh­r­­am Baloch stated that public’s rights can be secured by impl­ementing the RTI law, and it will result in the proper utilisation of government funds in remote areas of Balochistan. The RTI activist, Mir Behram Lehri, wondered why the provincial government has so far failed to appoint information commissioners. The longer it takes to implement this law, the more questions will arise, he said. Other speakers, including Balochistan Awami Party Central Information Secretary Dr Nashanas Lehri, National Party’s Quetta chapter President Ghulam Nabi Marri, Mir Musleh­uddin Mengal, Wadera Shahzad Lango, Adil Jehangir, Behram Baloch, Behram Lehri, Sadiq Sumalani and Rana Ahsan, said easier access to information helps eliminate corruption and improves accountability. Officers from various government departments, lawyers, civil society leaders, journalists and representatives of different organisations also attended the seminar.

Later, the police took her inside Street 33 where she identified the spot where she had been thrown after being tied, the FIR said, adding the police searched the spot and found a vest and two black socks and confiscated them. The woman was shifted to Polyclinic for medical examination and the doctor told the police that the final report will be issued later. The woman said she had stayed in a house at G-6/1-3. The police visited the house and collected information about the woman from a man present there as well as in the neighbourhood. Later, the woman was taken to Nadra where she was identified as a native of Rawalpindi. The police said during medical examination, the woman was found to be mentally disturbed. A senior police officer told Dawn that a case was also registered against the man in whose house the woman had stayed. The man, an ex-government official, told police that the woman jumped into his house in October 2023. Later, he took her to a police station where a report was also registered over the matter. In December 2023, she again came over to his house and the man took her to a hostel located on Sixth Road Rawalpindi. However, the hostel administration expelled her after she got engaged in physical confrontation with other women there. The man also told police that in February or March she again reached his house. He took her to the Belgium embassy as she claimed to be a Belgian national. However, staff at the embassy refused to take her as she neither had any identification documents nor the embassy had any record of her. On August 13, she again came to the house of the man and he made up his mind to get rid of her by tying and throwing her at some place. The officer said the medico-legal report of the woman conducted at Polyclinic was awaited. However, the doctor told police that she not sexually assaulted. He said her family was approached; however, her relatives including her siblings disowned her. In response, the police produced the woman in the court of a magistrate from where she was shifted to the Edhi Centre. Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: The Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) has terminated the services of 1,400 “ghost” employees, who were on its payroll for the past many years.  QMC Administrator Mohammad Hamza Shafqaat while confirming the sackings on Saturday said the decision had been taken after an investigation found these daily wage earners to be ghost employees.   “These employees had become a huge burden on the corporation which has been facing a financial crisis for a long time,” he said.  Mr Shafqaat, who is also the Quetta division commissioner, stated that most of the dismissed employees belonged to sanitation, fire brigade and other departments.  He said these employees existed only on papers, adding that they were geting salaries without discharging duties in any section of the corporation.  About the fire brigade department, he said only those regularly performing their duties would be rehired.  “Additionally, the sanitation department will continue its work under a public-private partnership, with  the private company being responsible for making appointments in the section,” he pointed out.  The administrator mentioned that any future recruitment needs would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and relevant officers of the corporation have been instructed not to release the salaries of any daily wage employee after August 16.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Presi­dent Asif Ali Zardari has urged all Pakistanis, particularly the youth, to actively participate in the Monsoon Tree Plantation Campaign 2024 and plant as many trees as possible to support the national objective of increasing the tree cover.  “As we embark on the Monsoon Tree Plantation Campaign 2024, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all Pakistanis for their unwavering dedication to preserving our environment,” he said in a message on the campaign.  “This campaign is not just a seasonal initiative; it is a crucial aspect of our national duty to protect and nurture the natural beauty and resources of our beloved country,” he said.  The president highlighted that currently, only about five per cent of Pakistan’s total land area is covered by forests, which are under severe pressure due to increasing demand for wood and other land uses.  “Through this Monsoon Tree Plantation Camp­a­ign, we have the opportun­ity to make a lasting imp­act on our environment and secure a greener, heal­thier future for our younger generation. I want to emphasise that forestry remains a top priority on Pakistan’s development agenda,” he added.  “Over two million mangroves have been planted in Sindh to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which also earned $27m by trading carbon credits in the international market.”   He said another restorative initiative — ‘The Living Indus Programme’ — contains components aimed at halting deforestation and received the UN Decade of Restoration Flagship Award.

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Irked by rift rumours and differences between party leadership, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan has summoned Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar for a meeting at Adiala jail. Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, while speaking to speaking to Geo News on Sunday, confirmed the development and noted that the incarcerated PTI founder has expressed concerned over the \"impression\" of grouping in the party. Saif's confirmation comes as the former ruling party has been facing internal turmoil after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Communication and Works Shakeel Ahmad Khan resigned over alleged corruption and bad governance by the CM Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province. The resignation came after Shakeel, during his meeting with Khan in Adiala jail complained about embezzlement in various departments of KP following which the ex-prime minister warned members of his party’s government in KP that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. The party then constituted a three-member committee to monitor corruption and governance in KP. Sources privy to the matter said that Shakeel alleged that he was unable to perform his duties properly due to the corruption and bad governance in the province and alleged that CM Gandapur’s interference in his department was affecting his performance.  In response, the KP chief minister revealed that he had signed a summary seeking Shakeel's de-notification on the committee's recommendation. The issue has caused a rift among party leadership with Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar putting their weight behind Shakeel which apparently didn't sit well with the KP government which has denotified the latter as CM Gandapur's focal person, The News reported on Sunday. Elaborating on the issue, Barrister Saif said that the PTI founder had directed Akbar's name to be included in the accountability committee and who was removed from the body at a later stage. Sources say that both the PTI leaders are expected to meet Khan next week after the KP government had complained of the duo. Speaking to the media in Islamabad earlier in the day, the KP CM's adviser recalled that \"some people\" had complained of corruption in KP to Khan after which the former premier held meetings with Gandapur and various others and conveyed a message stressing no tolerance for corruption. When I met the PTI founder he said that he would form a committee and noted that the forum would decide on the complaints, Saif said. Commenting on Ahmad's removal, the KP government spokesperson noted that the committee found former provincial minister guilty of the complaints that were levelled against him. \"Ahmad resigned before his dismissal [....] The matter should have ended after the resignation [but] an impression was given that there were differences in the party,\" said Saif. Recalling his meeting with the incarcerated PTI founder on Saturday, he said: \"[Imran] Khan has said that if anyone has any objection then [he should know] that I have formed the committee.\""

  "content": "State Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja Sunday denied the involvement of the government as the reason behind the recent internet slowdown across the country. Instead, the minister blamed the use of virtual private network (VPN) by internet users as the reason \"their phones\" slowed down. \"I can swear that the government of Pakistan did not block the internet or slow it down,\" said Khawaja while addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, acknowledging the public's outrage over the intermittent internet issues. The minister said that the government talked to experts and tried to figure out the situation day and night. She added that some applications were not downloading so people used VPN. \"Turning VPN on slows down the phone.\" The minister's statement comes after millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. Several experts, including Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), blamed the phenomenon on increased security and surveillance owing to the installation of a firewall in the country to control unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Earlier this week, Khawaja had defended its decision to enforce an internet firewall terming it a cybersecurity measure \"that every country in the world takes\". \"Look at the cybersecurity attacks being carried out on the country and the world as well. With the evolution of cybersecurity threats, states need to have a better capability to ensure that the threats are [well] responded to,\" she said on Thursday. The minister maintained she is in contact with IT authorities regarding internet issues. \"There will be a meeting on the issue of Internet next week as well.' Revealing government efforts to tackle the issue, Khawaja said that four more internet cables are being laid in Pakistan to increase internet connectivity. Before addressing the internet slow down issue during the presser, the minister informed journalists that the government is set to introduce 5G spectrum in the country in 2025. \"5G will provide the fastest internet,\" she said. She added that Islamabad has laid foundation stones for IT Parks in Islamabad and Karachi, which will create more than 10,000 jobs and millions of dollars will be earned. \"IT parks are being built with the help of South Korea,\" said Khawaja. The IT minister revealed that at least 250 e-employment centers will be created in collaboration with provinces across the country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Khawaja added, has allocated more than Rs60 billion for IT in the budget despite difficult conditions, while praising the exports worth Rs3 billion in the sector. \"IT sector is among the priorities of Prime Minister and Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC),\" she said, adding that a digitisation commission is being established and will be headed by the premier himself."

  "content": "Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Sunday revealed that incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan has \"decided\" to hold a public rally in Islamabad on August 22. \"We guarantee that there will be no law and order issue,\" Saif said during a press conference in Islamabad, adding that the party will try to avoid any violation of law on their part. The PTI leader's remarks come against the backdrop of its months-long struggle to hold a public gathering in the federal capital wherein authorities have time again denied it the permission to hold a rally citing security concerns. In June, Islamabad High Court's Justice Babar Sattar, while hearing a petition filed by the Imran Khan-founded party seeking permission to hold a rally, had directed the party and the city's administration to amicably sort out the issue after which the deputy commissioner allowed the PTI to hold a public gathering. However, Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa later suspended the no objection certificate (NOC) citing the beginning of the month of Muharram and security concerns along with complaints lodged by the local people.  Subsequently, the party moved the IHC seeking contempt of court proceedings against those responsible for the suspension of the NOC. After the PTI's plea was disposed of by the court, the party then once again sought the district administration's permission for a public meeting on August 13 in the federal capital. The former ruling party, for months, has been striving to hold a public rally and Barrister Saif's announcement comes after his boss and KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur's statement, made earlier this month, regarding a public gathering in Islamabad. \"No one can stop us from [staging a rally],\" Gandapur had said while addressing the PTI public gathering held in KP's Swabi to mark the one-year imprisonment of party founder Khan. Elaborating on the party's rally today, the CM's adviser said that the public gathering will be attended by a large number of people from KP. Noting that the PTI founder made it clear that the party was to approach the administration and the courts, Saif remarked that the country was facing a difficult situation.  \"Don't create more bitterness by putting barriers,\" he said.

  "content": "As several areas in the Karachi witness light showers, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Sunday, in its forecast, said that light to heavy rains in the port city are likely during the next 24 hours. Numerous areas in Karachi such as Malir Halt, Defence, Korangi, Landhi, Quaidabad and their adjoining areas were soaked after light rain. According to the Met Office, the system of rain is still present in Karachi with the city expected to remain cloudy with strong winds. The current temperature in the city is recorded 27°C, said the PMD, adding that the maximum temperature is likely to increase up to 32°C. It further added that the speed of sea breeze may exceed 15 to 25 kilometres per hour, while the percentage of humidity in the air is 88%. Meanwhile, in light of the rainy weather in the city, traffic police have  issued safety precautions urging motorcyclists to use left side of the road. The traffic police have advised to avoid suddenly using brakes as the road may become slippery due to wet conditions. \"While driving, keep the speed low and keep the distance from the next vehicle as much as possible,\" said the traffic police in its advisory. On the other hand, at least eight people have been killed and dozens others suffered injuries in separate rain-related incidents across the country. Heavy monsoon rains have wreaked havoc in Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Toba Achakzai, Qilla Abdullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Chaman, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Khairpur and other areas of the country. Flash floods triggered by the heavy rains damaged houses and crops besides washing away roads and bridges in different areas.

  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) on Sunday directed all airlines flying into Pakistan from abroad to adopt preventive measures against monkeypox at the airports, as the country records first case of virus earlier this week in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A new form of the virus has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. A case of the new variant was confirmed on August 15 in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health authorities said on Friday that one mpox case had been confirmed in the province, withdrawing a previous statement that three mpox patients had been detected there this week on arrival from the United Arab Emirates. The KP health authorities told Geo News that two of the three mpox cases previously reported were patients who contracted the disease last year, while one case is due to the recent strain of the virus all across the globe. Meanwhile, in a set of instructions, the PCAA directed all the airlines arriving from abroad to provide masks to their passengers. \"Whereas, it has been made mandatory for staff of the airlines and ground handling service as well to wear masks,\" it said. The authority instructed airlines to ensure sanitising hands of the staff and passengers, while their luggage should also be disinfected.  The passengers having symptoms of monkeypox should be isolated, it ordered.  A health officer in KP's Mardan district had said the location of the confirmed mpox patient, a man the officer said had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was unknown.  He had initially received tests and advice at a hospital in Peshawar, Dr Javed Iqbal had told Reuters, but later returned to his home a few hours away in Mardan and then went to another district. \"When we visited his home in Mardan, it was locked from outside and his neighbours told us that the family has left for Dir,\" said the DHO Mardan. \"We approached our fellow colleagues of the health department in Dir district, but they couldn’t trace him even in Dir.\" The national health ministry had said it was carrying out contact tracing of the patient it had identified, who they said was from Mardan. They were also boosting airport surveillance and monitoring with extra health personnel, the ministry had stated. Federal Ministry of Health spokesperson Sajid Shah had said so far they had no confirmation of the new variant, but the sequencing of the sample of the confirmed patient was underway. \"Once that's done, we will be able to say what strain is this,\" Shah had said."

According to details, heavy monsoon rains wreaked havoc in Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Toba Achakzai, Qilla Abdullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Chaman, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Khairpur and other areas of the country. Flash floods triggered by the heavy rains damaged houses and crops besides washing away roads and bridges in different areas. In addition to this, the roofs and boundary walls of several houses also collapsed. At least, 10 people were injured in rain-related incidents in different parts of Balochistan. In Chaman, flash floods washed away a railway track and damaged another one in Noshki, cutting the rail link between Pakistan and Iran. Scattered rains also drenched Lahore on Saturday while the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast cloudy weather with chances of rain for the next 24 hours. Faisalabad received 131 millimetres of rain, a day earlier, which turned the harsh and sizzling weather into a pleasant one and turned the low-lying areas into knee-deep water ponds. Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) spokesperson said that a maximum 131mm of rain was recorded in Madina Town while Allama Iqbal Colony witnessed 79mm rain, Dogar Basti 74mm, Gulistan Colony 78mm and Ghulam Muhammad Abad area 91mm rain. Sukkur plunged into darkness as the city received 180mm rains last night.   The PMD has updated its weather advisory, indicating a shift in the monsoon system from Karachi and lower Sindh towards central and upper Sindh, as well as Balochistan. According to the PMD alert issued Saturday, the likelihood of heavy rain in Karachi has diminished, while the city may still experience light to moderate rainfall. Furthermore, cities in Sindh such as Jacobabad, Larkana, Dadu, Shikarpur, Ghotki and Sukkur are expected to experience heavy rainfall. As per the Met Office forecast, this weather system may continue to affect Sindh until the morning of August 19. Previously, the PMD said it expected thundershowers for Karachi within the next 24 hours. However, the latest advisory suggests that the intensity has decreased for the port city. — Additional input from APP"

The minister maintained she is in contact with IT authorities regarding internet issues. \"There will be a meeting on the issue of Internet next week as well.' Revealing government efforts to tackle the issue, Khawaja said that four more internet cables are being laid in Pakistan to increase internet connectivity. Before addressing the internet slow down issue during the presser, the minister informed journalists that the government is set to introduce 5G spectrum in the country in 2025. \"5G will provide the fastest internet,\" she said. She added that Islamabad has laid foundation stones for IT Parks in Islamabad and Karachi, which will create more than 10,000 jobs and millions of dollars will be earned. \"IT parks are being built with the help of South Korea,\" said Khawaja. The IT minister revealed that at least 250 e-employment centers will be created in collaboration with provinces across the country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Khawaja added, has allocated more than Rs60 billion for IT in the budget despite difficult conditions, while praising the exports worth Rs3 billion in the sector. \"IT sector is among the priorities of Prime Minister and Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC),\" she said, adding that a digitisation commission is being established and will be headed by the premier himself."

  "content": "In its forecast on Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said the port city will witness light to heavy rains in the next 24 hours. Several areas across Karachi — such as Malir Halt, Defence, Korangi, Landhi, Quaidabad and their adjoining areas — received light showers today. The system of rain, as per the Met Office, is still present in Karachi with the city expected to remain cloudy with strong winds. The current temperature in the city is recorded 27°C, said the PMD, adding that the maximum temperature is likely to increase up to 32°C. It further added that the speed of sea breeze may exceed 15 to 25 kilometres per hour, while the percentage of humidity in the air is 88%. Meanwhile, in light of the rainy weather in the city, traffic police have issued safety precautions urging motorcyclists to use left side of the road. The traffic police have advised to avoid suddenly using brakes as the road may become slippery due to wet conditions. \"While driving, keep the speed low and keep the distance from the next vehicle as much as possible,\" said the traffic police in its advisory. On the other hand, at least eight people have been killed and dozens others suffered injuries in separate rain-related incidents across the country. Heavy monsoon rains have wreaked havoc in Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Toba Achakzai, Qilla Abdullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Chaman, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Khairpur and other areas of the country. Flash floods triggered by the heavy rains damaged houses and crops besides washing away roads and bridges in different areas. In addition to this, the roofs and boundary walls of several houses also collapsed. At least, 10 people were injured in rain-related incidents in different parts of Balochistan."

  "content": "After its prolonged struggle to hold a powershow in Islamabad, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan has \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22, said Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Sunday. Addressing journalists in Islamabad, Saif reassured that the party will try to avoid any violation of law on their part and said: \"We guarantee that there will be no law and order issue.\" His statement comes amidst former ruling party's months-long struggle to hold a public gathering in the federal capital wherein authorities have time again denied it the permission to hold a rally citing security concerns. In June, Islamabad High Court's Justice Babar Sattar, while hearing a petition filed by the Imran Khan-founded party seeking permission to hold a rally, had directed the party and the city's administration to amicably sort out the issue after which the deputy commissioner allowed the PTI to hold a public gathering. However, Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa later suspended the no objection certificate (NOC) citing the beginning of the month of Muharram and security concerns along with complaints lodged by the local people.  Subsequently, the party moved the IHC seeking contempt of court proceedings against those responsible for the suspension of the NOC. After the PTI's plea was disposed of by the court, the party then once again sought the district administration's permission for a public meeting on August 13 in the federal capital. The former ruling party, for months, has been striving to hold a public rally and Barrister Saif's announcement comes after his boss and KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur's statement, made earlier this month, regarding a public gathering in Islamabad. \"No one can stop us from [staging a rally],\" Gandapur had said while addressing the PTI public gathering held in KP's Swabi to mark the one-year imprisonment of party founder Khan. Elaborating on the party's rally today, the CM's adviser said that the public gathering will be attended by a large number of people from KP. Noting that the PTI founder made it clear that the party was to approach the administration and the courts, Saif remarked that the country was facing a difficult situation.  \"Don't create more bitterness by putting barriers,\" he said.

  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) on Sunday directed the authorities concerned to implement precautionary measures against monkeypox at airports after a case of the infectious viral disease was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Since a new strain of the virus appears to spread more easily through close contact, it has raised concerns throughout the world. The first indication of the new variant's global spread was a case that was verified in Sweden on August 15 and linked to an expanding outbreak in Africa. In this regard, the PCAA directed all the airlines arriving from abroad to provide masks to their passengers. \"Whereas, it has been made mandatory for staff of the airlines and ground handling service as well to wear masks,\" it said. The authority instructed airlines to ensure sanitising hands of the staff and passengers, while their luggage should also be disinfected. The passengers having symptoms of monkeypox should be isolated, it ordered. A health officer in KP's Mardan district had said the location of the confirmed mpox patient, a man the officer said had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was unknown. He had initially received tests and advice at a hospital in Peshawar, Dr Javed Iqbal had told Reuters, but later returned to his home a few hours away in Mardan and then went to another district. \"When we visited his home in Mardan, it was locked from outside and his neighbours told us that the family has left for Dir,\" said the DHO Mardan. \"We approached our fellow colleagues of the health department in Dir district, but they couldn’t trace him even in Dir.\" The national health ministry had said it was carrying out contact tracing of the patient it had identified, who they said was from Mardan. They were also boosting airport surveillance and monitoring with extra health personnel, the ministry had stated. Federal Ministry of Health spokesperson Sajid Shah had said so far they had no confirmation of the new variant, but the sequencing of the sample of the confirmed patient was underway. \"Once that's done, we will be able to say what strain is this,\" Shah had said."

  "description": "Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stated on Sunday that the Rs14 subsidy provided by the Punjab government would be funded through the province’s own budget. After months of public outcry and opposition’s criticism over rising electricity prices, the Punjab government announced on Friday that customers using up to 500 units will get a subsidy of Rs14 per unit in August and September. The move, largely seen as an attempt to placate PML-N’s vote bank in Punjab, was announced by the party’s president, Nawaz Sharif. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said she was speaking to “put an end to the propaganda” spread by those responsible for the current economic crisis. “[Due to the propaganda], they are inciting conflicts between provinces, so it was important to clarify today that the Punjab government is providing relief from its own budget.” Aurangzeb said that the Punjab government was funding the subsidy by reducing expenditures and reallocating funds from various programs where possible. The energy department has been providing estimates to help the provincial government meet its targets, she added. “He [Nawaz Sharif] also requested other provinces to cut back on their expenditures and provide relief to their people too,” she said. “And we would be delighted if similar relief could be provided in provinces such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan.” She stated that with improved governance and policy adjustments, the Punjab government was now able to offer affordable roti to its people. “[But instead of appreciating] the power tariff reduction, falsehoods and propaganda are being spread and the matter is being politicised,” she lamented. Aurangzeb, like Nawaz Sharif, blamed PTI’s tenure for the exorbitant electricity prices, and exonerated the incumbent federal government of all blame. She listed down “achievements” of the Punjab government after coming into power, which included providing a Ramzan relief package and laptop scheme and asked other provinces to follow suit. Amid rising electricity bills, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) last week announced an increase in electricity tariffs by Rs2.56 per unit, marking the second consecutive incr­ease, as there was a Rs3.33 per unit rise for fuel adjustment in May. The inflated bills particularly affected lifeline consumers (using 51-100 units per month) and those in the protected category (up to 200 monthly units), as they were pushed out of the monthly ceiling, resulting in higher rates than their actual consumption warranted.

  "description": "Sindh’s Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Sunday ordered a probe on child marriages in the Dadu district, a statement from his office said following recent media coverage of the issue. He ordered Hyderabad’s commissioner to submit a report on the marriage of 45 underage girls in Dadu’s Khan Muhammad Mallah village. Reports indicate that these marriages have occurred since the last monsoon, with 15 taking place in May and June of this year. The girls’ parents have stated that they hurried the marriage of their daughters, usually in exchange for money, to “save them from poverty”. The chief minister directed the formation of a committee to conduct a detailed inquiry into the village and requested a report on the social, economic, and legal status of the girls involved. “What is the current condition of the married girls? Submit a report covering every aspect so that the issue can be resolved,” the chief minister directed the commissioner, according to the statement. He also requested that the commissioner provide recommendations in the inquiry and include in the report whether the married girls were from flood-affected families, as well as the amount of aid they received. Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December. The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced. Unicef has reported “significant strides” in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk. “We would expect to see an 18 per cent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,” it said in a report after the 2022 floods.

  "content": "     ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday castigated the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for attempting to change Punjab election tribunals, appointed by the Lahore High Court (LHC) chief justice to settle electoral disputes. Addressing a press conference, PTI leader Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that the people of Pakistan cannot forget the February 8 general elections, wherein according to him, the worst rigging took place. Raja, who had lost his election from NA-128 Lahore, said that the election tribunals in Punjab, appointed by the LHC chief justice, were not allowed to function. However, he added, the election tribunals in other provinces functioned as per the list provided by the respective chief justices. \"They [the government] fear the most in Punjab,\" he said, claiming that 'many bridges' will collapse if the tribunals — appointed by the LHC chief justice — hear the disputes. Moreover, the PTI leader said, the one who creates differences between the institutions and people is 'Pakistan's enemy'. For her part, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi — who also lost the Multan NA-151 seat — said that the democracy's strength lies in women's representation, regretting that only three women leaders were representing the party in Parliament. It is pertinent to mention here that Salman Akram Raja had filed a review petition with the Supreme Court of Pakistan, seeking to make functional the Election Tribunal in Punjab. A five-member larger bench of the apex court headed by the CJP would also take up the appeal of the ECP against the LHC judgement, appointing eight election tribunals in Punjab to address elections disputes from the February 8 general elections. The other members of the bench include Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. Previously, on July 4, the Supreme Court had suspended the LHC judgement and its notification regarding the appointment of eight election tribunals in Punjab. This suspension was in effect until the completion of consultations between the LHC chief justice and ECP. On the other side, President Asif Ali Zardari — on July 9 — approved the Election (Amendment) Bill 2024, empowering the electoral watchdog to appoint retired judges of high courts to election tribunals. Under the amendment to the Elections Act, 2017, the ECP would not need consultation with the respective chief justices for the appointment of retired judges as election tribunals."

  "content": "    Praising the precedent of an internal accountability process initiated by the Pakistan Army, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Talal Chaudhry on Sunday hinted at more rigorous moves in near future as \"more institutions will follow the trend of accountability\". \"The accountability process has started in Pakistan after 75 years,\" said Chaudhry in a statement today while pointing towards arrests and probe against former spymaster Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid and other ex-servicemen. He said that political parties would also have to start the process of internal accountability.   The senator of the ruling party alleged that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Information Secretary Raoof Hasan was \"providing material to anti-Pakistan journalists\" and he was not alone but there was an organised planning behind the moves. The PML-N stalwart went on to say that all other institutions, like the Pakistan Army, would have to kick start accountability in the country as no one was beyond it. Taking aim at the judiciary, he claimed that former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar had been in contact with the ex-ISI chief [during his tenure] but he was denying the facts today. \"The decisions taken under the leadership of Nisar had brought Pakistan to this [deteriorated] situation.\" The politico, who served as a federal parliamentary secretary during the rule of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif from 2013 to 2017, said that the economy was moving in the right direction and no compromise would be made on Pakistan’s integrity. He blamed the former ruling party led by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan for isolating the country on the diplomatic front and making deliberate moves to displease the global allies of Pakistan. Chaudhry's remarks came in a series of statements delivered by the ruling party’s ministers following the military's August 12 announcement regarding the arrest of the country's former top spy Faiz over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and the initiation of a process of Field General Court Martial against him. Another three retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest. A day ago, Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar said that more big fish would be netted following Faiz’s arrest as the scope of the investigation will expand. Tarar had said that the military had its mechanism of self-accountability and recent arrests were done after transparent investigations. \"Be it Saqib or Nisar, the scope of the investigation will expand as things unfold after the arrest of Gen Faiz,\" the federal minister said while referring to the former chief justice of Pakistan, who was accused of favouring the PTI founder. The military had said in a statement that Gen Faiz was arrested because there were \"multiple instances of violation\" of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" it added. The army had also said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company's owner."

  "description": "Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani on Sunday informed Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah that local authorities across the province had been mobilised as various districts saw heavy rainfall a day ago. Widespread heavy rains across most districts of interior Sindh on Friday night and Saturday wreaked havoc on the electricity network and drainage system, causing heavy flooding in both urban and rural areas alike. As per a forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), heavy downpours and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh till tomorrow (Monday).      According to an update issued by the PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division at 8am, in the last 24 hours, Khairpur received the highest amount of rainfall (169 millimetres) with Larkana ranking second (123mm). Rohri and Mohenjo Daro each witnessed 119mm of rain while Sukkur received 100mm and Jacobabad 99mm. Dadu (75mm), Mirpurkhas (35mm), Padidan (31mm) and Chhor (24mm) were among other areas to see heavy showers.    Rainfall across Sindh district in past 24 hours, recorded at 8am on August 18.— PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division  Presiding over a high-level rain emergency meeting at CM House on Sunday morning, Murad noted that heavy rains in Sukkur, Dadu, Jacobabad, and Naushahro Feroze had inundated roads and streets there. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to protect the life and property of the people, and then dewatering efforts should be made, he added. “I want to see the entire government machinery — including district administration [and] local bodies, particularly in the rain-affected areas — working on the roads, helping people, and the irrigation department patrolling on the embankments of the canals and distributaries to avoid breaches,” CM Murad said.         The meeting was attended by Ghani, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Sindh Transport Minister Sharjeel Memon, Advisor Najmi Alam, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Local Govt Secretary Khalid Hyder Shah and Health Secretary Rehan Baloch. Salman Shah, director general of the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Rangers DG Major Gen Azhar Waqas, Corps Headquarters and Komkar representatives, and Weather Director Ameer Hyder, among others, were also present in the meeting. Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, Sukkur Mayor Arsalan Shaikh, commissioners of Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad and Mirpurkhas, and their deputy commissioners attended the meeting via video link. Ghani informed the CM that he had activated the local bodies all over Sindh and provided them with the necessary facilities to work properly in the rain-affected areas. Sukkur Commissioner Fayaz Abbasi briefed the chief minister that out of four spells of heavy rains in his district, three spells had been dealt with by clearing the roads and low-lying areas within three to four hours, while the rainwater from the fourth spell was being dealt with. CM Murad was further briefed that the PDMA has provided 35 diesel engines, eight dewatering machines, and 12 tractor-mounted machines, as well as two mirage trucks for dewatering mud pumps. Regarding losses, the CM was informed that 21 persons sustained injuries, five buffaloes perished, and 48 houses were damaged. PDMA DG Salman Shah informed the CM that 26,150 tents, 80,750 mosquito nets, 25,650 ‘chataais’, 12,300 cotton mattresses, 12,900 synthetic sleeping mats, 7,700 hygiene kits and 25,750 jerry cans had been sent to the rain-affected areas to provide relief to the people. Larkana Commissioner Mustafa Phul and his Hyderabad counterpart Bilal Memon listed the measurements of the rainfall that various districts had received in the past 24 hours. Senior Minister Shrajeel Memon informed the CM that he was in close coordination with the Hyderabad administration and had activated all the concerned departments to address any rain-related emergency. All the divisional commissioners complained against Hesco and Sepco for power outages at the pumping station feeders, due to which water disposal was being affected badly. At this, the CM directed Sindh Energy Minister Nasir Shah to communicate with the power distribution companies and instruct them to free the pumping stations from load-shedding and other interruptions. Meanwhile, Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero briefed the CM about the flood situation, specifically focusing on the floods of the Kirthar ranges, whose catchments are located in Balochistan. In Balochistan, these catchments are ungauged, complicating the flood forecast for the right bank of the Indus in Sindh during yearly monsoons. However, referring to the historic gauges and predicted rainfall, Khero said that the existing infrastructure could hold the forecasted floods. At this, the CM directed the irrigation department to shift the headquarters of the right bank to the vulnerable areas and personally monitor the flood situations. "

APP/File  Raoof Hasan's ties with Indian journalist exposed PTI: minister.Says Indians bankrolled PTI and calls it \"foreign-funded\" party.Now, it is understandable why May 9...",
  "content": "    Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar has yet again censured the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), saying that the Imran Khan-founded party has been spearheading the India-sponsored agenda in the country. The minister said this on Sunday after detained PTI's Information Secretary Raoof Hasan's contacts with an Indian journalist came to the fore. The PTI leader's contacts with the journalist of the neighbouring country had exposed the former ruling party, he added. Hasan was arrested on July 22, the day when Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry called on the nation to stand up against militants and \"digital terrorists\". The PTI leader was arrested by the Islamabad police from the party's Central Secretariat for heading a digital media cell allegedly involved in running propaganda against Pakistan and its integrity.  \"The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,\" police said, announcing Hasan's arrest — who was later handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).  The same month, he was transferred to the custody of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the police for interrogation in a terrorism case.  In his statement issued earlier today, the information minister said that the former ruling party was using its social media cell to run a campaign against the Pakistan Army, adding that the investigation [with Hasan] has unearthed how the Indians bankrolled the PTI from abroad. Tarar called the PTI a \"foreign-funded\" party, saying the PTI caused harm to the country's foreign policy through a cipher. The party, he added, is using \"its foreign lords\" to harm national integrity.  Commenting further on the recent revelation of Hasan's contact with the Indian journalist, the politico stressed that Hasan [in his messages to the Indian journalist] mirrored his party's approach.  \"The PTI's social media cell was a major source of connections with the country's enemies. Now, we can understand why the May 9 attacks were launched,\" he added. The federal minister further said that the \"foreign-funded coterie\" had crossed all limits of animosity against the country, as the party's real objective was to damage Pakistan's national interests and its army. Condemning the PTI, he said the Imran-founded party's followers are fulfilling the Indian agenda while living in Pakistan and they brought terrorists back to the country to complete the Indian agenda.  Tarar also said that \"Faiz-Niazi-Bushra collusion\" did harm the country for their nefarious designs.  The military earlier last week announced that the ex-director-general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) General (retd) Faiz Hamid had been taken into custody over allegations of land-grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and a process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated against him. The retired general turned out to be a pawn of the PTI founder to kick up political instability in the country, he said, adding that the 'Faiz-Niazi connection' tried to create the impression that there is some sort of rift in the military.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: At least 195 people have been killed and 362 got wounded in separate rain-related incidents as torrential downpours continued battering different parts of the country from July 1 to August 17, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in its report released on Sunday. The disaster management authority elaborated on the devastation caused by continued wet spells, which resulted in a great loss of lives, properties, crops and livestock since the beginning of the monsoon season. According to the report, seven deaths were reported within the 24 hours till Saturday, August 17, 2024, including six deaths in Punjab and one in Balochistan. The total number of deaths has soared to 195 with today’s casualty figures. Subsequently, at least 30 persons sustained injuries in the same period, with the highest number of casualties reported in Punjab, up to 29. The total number of injuries caused by the devastating rains was recorded at 362.   The NDMA further stated that the recently released death toll was reconciled with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Balochistan which experienced disastrous outcomes of heavy rainfalls this season. Flash floods after heavy rains in low-lying areas caused damage to a total of 22 houses across the country in a day, taking the cumulative damages to infrastructure and private properties 2,293, including 1,559 partially and 734 fully damaged from July 1 to August 18. The wet spells have also affected over 44km of roads and 30 bridges in the same period. In a relevant development, the NDMA's National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) anticipated that more monsoon rains are expected to hit different parts of the country from August 18 (evening/night) to August 19 with occasional gaps.  Consequently, heavy downpours may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar from 18th & 19th August. The authority issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather. Weather-related disasters are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global greenhouse gases yet is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2022, catastrophic flooding plunged a third of the country underwater, killing over 1,700 people, displacing 33 million and destroying thousands of homes."

  "description": "YouTuber Aun Ali Khosa, who was allegedly abducted on August 15, has returned home safely, his lawyers confirmed on Monday. On Friday, the Lahore High Court (LHC) ordered the Lahore police to recover Khosa by Aug 20. A day prior, his wife Binish Iqbal had filed a petition in the court claiming that her husband was “in the unlawful and illegal custody of the law enforcement authorities”. Iqbal stated that the whereabouts of Aun were unknown and she feared for his “safety having strong apprehension that his husband has been a victim of enforced disappearance.” According to the petition, Aun was a “digital content creator, a writer, and a dignified comedian/artist having a massive following of 137,000 subscribers on YouTube”. It claimed that at 2am on August 15, a dozen police officials and “men with masked faces in plain clothes” barged into his apartment after breaking apart the entrance door. The heavily armed men confiscated Aun’s phone, laptop, computer system, and digital camera, the petition further detailed. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said that it was alarmed by reports of Khosa’s abduction, and concerned that the incident may be related to his work as a satirist and called for his immediate recovery. On Monday, a little after midnight, Khosa’s lawyer Khadija Siddiqi shared a post on X saying: “Alhamdulillah, Aun Ali Khosa has been released! He has reached home!”         Another one of Khosa’s lawyers, Mian Ali Ashfaq, also confirmed his return home in a statement on X.         In another statement, Ashfaq said he had spoken to Khosa in great detail. “Alhamdulillah, he is courageous, safe and determined,” Ashfaq said. “May Allah bless him and his family every step of the way.” He also thanked Siddiqi for her support and representation.         In a separate post on X, Siddiqi lamented the recurring cases of abductions. “Over the last two months, we have fought all missing persons cases, including Aun Ali’s, at the Lahore High Court.” “The kidnappers have the same method; they come in the dark of the night at 2 or 3am, break down the door, there’s about a dozen men with masks on their faces, carrying weapons. “They take away mobile phones and laptops, and if there’s a CCTV installed, they remove it. They harass the victim and take him away,” Siddiqi said. “Then, when the high court’s ruling comes, they return the victim to his house in the dark of the night.” She expressed hope that this practice would come to and end, adding: “If someone has violated the law, bring them to court and prosecute them there.”         "

  "description": "Seven labourers working at the Diamer Bhasha Dam were killed and one was seriously injured when their vehicle fell into a ravine near the Karakoram Highway on Monday, police confirmed. According to the Diamer Police Control Room, the eight dam workers were travelling in a Mazda vehicle when it lost control and fell into the ravine. Diamer Rescue 1122 in charge Shoukat Riaz said that five workers died on the spot while three others were injured. Later, two of them succumbed to their injuries. “Diamer Rescue dispatched every mortuary vehicle and ambulance”, Riaz said. According to a list released by the RHQ Hospital Chilas, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the deceased have been identified as Yousuf, Ehsanullah, Muhibullah, Sajjad, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) employee Sajjad, and Mujeebullah. Meanwhile, the injured has been identified as Ibadullah. Road accidents are frequent in Pakistan, where drivers often disregard traffic regulations and safety measures, especially on deteriorating roads in mountainous regions. In May, at least 20 people died while 21 others were injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, rescue officials said. According to Diamer district rescue officer Shoukat Riaz, the bus, which belonged to a private company, was travelling from Rawalpindi to Gilgit when the driver lost control near Gunar Farm. The injured were shifted to Chilas Hospital, the rescue officer said, adding that the number of injured was initially 35 but many succumbed to their injuries during treatment. According to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, three women were also among the dead. He noted that a total of 43 passengers were on the bus. "

  "description": "GILGIT: As flash floods fuelled by rapidly melting glaciers continued to wreak havoc in Gilgit-Baltistan, the Karakoram Highway was blocked at multiple points due to mudslides on Sunday. The rapidly melting glaciers due to heatwaves have caused flooding in streams and rivers in various areas of Gilgit-Baltistan. These floods have swept away crops and damaged dozens of houses in the region. In addition to the KKH, the Gilgit-Shandur road was also blocked due to flooding. According to authorities, the KKH has been blocked at multiple locations from Gilgit to Khunjerab. In Gilgit’s Jaglot and Hunza’s Shishkat village, the highway has been blocked due to mudflow. Subsequently, thousands of passengers, including foreign and local tourists, had been stranded due to the road closure. The Gilgit-Ghizer road was also blocked at multiple locations after local nullahs overflowed in the Ghizer district. According to the police, the flooding occurred in various nullahs of Ghizer on Sunday, causing damages to public and private property. Due to the floods, over two dozen houses were damaged and three dozen houses were partially damaged.  The bridges, roads, water supply channels, and electricity systems were also affected by the floods, which also disconnected the link between several villages in Ghizer.  Similarly, flash floods also occurred in Aliabad, Haiderabad, and other areas in Hunza as well as in Shigar and Nagar. There was no official statement from the government regarding the scale of devastation in multiple districts of the region. However, the director general of the GB disaster management remained unavailable for comments despite multiple attempts. Published in Dawn, August 19th, 2024 "

  "description": "WASHINGTON: Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, the ambassador-designate to the United States, is expected to arrive in Washington this week, diplomatic sources told Dawn. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad announced in late June that the government is sending Additional Foreign Secretary (Middle East and SIFC) Rizwan Saeed Sheikh as the country’s new envoy to the United States. The replacement of the envoy in Washington was long overdue. The previous ambassador, Masood Khan, had already received a three-month extension after his contract ended in March, which expired at the end of June. “These appointments were under consideration for the last several weeks. The announcement has just been made,” the ministry’s spokesperson said. Others reportedly considered for the Washington D.C. appointment included the High Commissioner to Australia, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, and former envoy to the US, UN and UK, Dr Maleeha Lodhi. Mr Sheikh is also expected to address the influence of the PTI in the United States, particularly in Congress, which recently adopted a resolution endorsing the party’s demands.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s government is throttling the internet and social media while it tests new controls to crush dissent, activists and business leaders say, putting the country’s economic recovery at risk. Internet networks have been up to 40 per cent slower than normal since July, according to one IT association, while documents, images and voice notes have been disrupted on WhatsApp, used by tens of millions of people.     Digital rights experts believe the state is testing a ‘firewall’ — a security system that monitors network traffic but can also be used to control online spaces. “The Internet slowdown is due to the installation of a national firewall and content filtering system by the state aimed at increasing surveillance and at censoring political dissent, especially the criticism of the security establishment for its interference in politics,” digital rights expert and activist Usama Khilji told AFP. The authorities appear to be targeting WhatsApp because of its end-to-end encryption capabilities, which enable users to securely share information without it being accessed by any third party, he added. The government and the telecommunications authority for weeks refused to comment on the slowdown. Pakistan Telecommunications Authority declined to comment when contacted by AFP. Not business as usual The issues have surfaced as Pakistan’s military — the country’s most powerful institution — says it is battling the so-called “digital terrorism”. Regular rallies have been held this year demanding the state do more to tackle militant violence in the border regions with Afghanistan, while protesters in southwestern Balochistan have rallied over alleged rights abuses by authorities in their crackdown on separatist groups. But analysts say the main target of the digital disruption is the party of jailed opposition leader Imran Khan, still wildly popular and boosted by a young, tech-savvy voter base. Prominent Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir has launched a legal challenge against the government over “the apparent installation of a firewall” at Islamabad High Court, which is due to hear the case on Monday. The firewall’s “inexplicable opacity and ambiguity” is sapping Pakistan’s economic potential and could cost its IT sector up to $300 million, according to the Pakistan Software Houses Association, which represents IT firms. Shahzad Arshad, head of the Wireless & Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, warned that if “this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan”. He added that connectivity had slowed by up 40pc over the past month. But even as authorities throttled connectivity and WhatsApp access, Pakistan’s Punjab province splashed out last week on adverts in New York’s Times Square — trying to sell itself as an “IT city”.         “Even if a firewall is necessary for security, trials could have saved the livelihoods of thousands of freelance software developers and avoided damage to Pakistan’s credibility as a reliable supplier of IT/IT-enabled services,” Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council said Saturday. AFP has contacted WhatsApp parent company Meta for comment. ‘Fundamental rights’ Activists have long criticised the government’s censorship and control of the internet and media, shrinking an already limited space for free speech in the conservative country. The social media platform X has been banned in Pakistan since the election when it was used to air allegations of poll rigging against Mr Khan’s party. The party’s social media team has also been targeted by arrests and detentions. Shahzad Ahmad, head of the independent digital rights watchdog Bytes for All in Pakistan, said the firewall was largely designed to give the government control of the internet.“We believe that the firewall will create distrust among IT investors in Pakistan… and will also compromise citizens’ fundamental rights.” Published in Dawn, August 19th, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: One of the country’s largest payment gateways has denied reports, circulating on social media, that ATMs will remain closed for two to three days due to a cyberattack. The clarification from 1LINK Limited, a consortium of major banks that own and operate the largest representative inter-bank network in the country, was issued after a message started making rounds on social media and shared on WhatsApp that ATMs would remain closed for two to three days due to a ransomware attack. The message also warned people not to conduct any online transactions during the period. It claimed that this report was aired on BBC Radio. However, BBC Urdu — the local arm of the British broadcasting network — has dismissed the claim. It said that the last transmission of BBC Urdu Radio in Pakistan was aired on Dec 31, 2022, and no reports of a cyberattack in the country were aired on BBC recently. In the clarification issued on Sunday, 1LINK — which provides banking services like ATM switching, funds transfer and payment systems — advised the public not to pay any heed to such reports. “Thus far, no cyber threat has been observed on the ATM and online banking ecosystem in this context, and the financial service industry remains vigilant as ever before,” the statement added. “The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is actively working with banks and 1LINK to maintain the security of Pakistan’s financial infrastructure and digital payments ecosystem, ensuring compliance with stringent IT and security guidelines.” Published in Dawn, August 19th, 2024 "

  "description": "GILGIT: Pakistan Army helicopters airlifted two stranded Russian climbers on Gasherbrum IV (7,925m) a day after an avalanche hit a group of five mountaineers who were trying to scale the sixth-highest mountain in Pakistan alpine style. Out of the five, one was reportedly killed while two received injuries and awaited rescue in critical condition. Shigar Deputy Commissioner Waliullah Falahi told Dawn that five Russian climbers Sergei Nilov, Mikhail Mironov, Alexy Bautin, Sergei Mironov and Evgenii Lablokov had started their mission to ascend the peak on August 4. On Saturday, a snow avalanche hit the climbers in the morning at a height of 6,400 metres. As a result, Sergei Nilov went missing while Mikhail Mironov and Sergei Mironov were injured. Alexy Bautin and Evgeni Lablokov remained unhurt and were later rescued by the army and airlifted to Skardu.  Army rescues two mountaineers a day after avalanche hit Russian climbers on peak  Mr Bautin told Dawn they were hit by an avalanche, which started at 7,000m. He said Sergei Nilov lost his life whereas Mikhail Mironov and Sergei Mironov were injured, adding that he was in touch with his colleagues through satellite phone. According to Mr Bautin, his stranded comrades, though in a stable condition, needed immediate rescue. Tour operator Ghulam Muhammad said helicopters couldn’t be operated on Sunday after the first sortie – which rescued the two climbers – due to poor weather conditions at the mountain. He said the climbers were stranded at an altitude of over 6,400m and helicopters could not land or hover in that area. According to the operator, the helicopters will drop four local high-altitude climbers at 6,000 metres to rescue the stranded mountaineers. “The rescue team will attempt to bring down the injured Russian climbers from above 6,400m, and the army helicopters will airlift the climbers to Skardu, he added. According to a press release issued by Karrar Haideri, secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, a dedicated team of five Russian climbers set out on a mission to Gasherbrum IV, driven by a solemn commitment to retrieve the body of their fellow climber, Dmitry Golovchenko, who went missing on the same mountain in 2023. He said their expedition, marked by determination and camaraderie, was meant to bring closure to a tragic loss. The statement said Sergei Nilov was missing, with no information available about his status whereas two of the climbers sustained severe injuries in the incident. “Their condition is critical, and there is little hope that they will survive beyond the next day, casting a further shadow over the already grim situation,” the statement added. The alpine club secretary said the army helicopters would launch another rescue effort to locate the three missing climbers, including Sergei Nilov. “The situation on Gasherbrum IV remains dire, with the outlook for the remaining team members growing increasingly bleak. This tragedy underscores the harsh and unpredictable dangers of high-altitude mountaineering, where even the best-prepared expeditions can face life-threatening challenges,” the statement said.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has raised questions over the performance of the country’s higher education institutions involving around Rs450 billion worth of development projects and urged the prime minister to replace the leadership of Higher Education Commission (HEC) with a fresh team having experience and bold vision to address the prevailing challenges.  The minister said that “169 projects with a total cost of Rs446bn and a throw-forward of Rs314bn” were at risk. However, despite his strong criticism of the top HEC management, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif granted one-year extension to the HEC’s incumbent chairman a couple of days ago.  In a letter, the planning minister had sensitised the PM that nearly two-thirds of Pakistan’s population was below the age of 30 that has to play a pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of the nation. This significant youth bulge presents both an opportunity and a risk. On one hand, it offers potential for a robust workforce that can drive development, provided that these young individuals are equipped with quality education, good health, and essential skills.  On the other hand, Mr Iqbal said, if these young entrants into the labour force do not receive quality education and are poorly skilled, they will struggle to find decent employment, leading to adverse socio-economic consequences.    Institutions have failed to prepare graduates that meet expectations of employers and industry, Ahsan Iqbal tells PM  Pakistan currently faces an acute human development crisis, driven in large part by the poor quality of higher education, he added.  The minister pointed out that a 2023 study by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics revealed that 31 per cent of university graduates were unemployed.   “Research indicates that higher education institutions in Pakistan have failed to prepare their graduates to meet the expectations and demands of employers and industry,” he said.   He attributed the “poor performance” to the misalignment of university curricula with industry needs and the rapidly evolving technological landscape, weak regulatory and quality assurance mechanisms, a disconnect between performance and funding of universities, substandard research quality, and weak governance and management within the HEC itself.  HEC misses targets  The planning minister recalled that the primary mandate and responsibility for ensuring high-quality higher education lays with the HEC. “Unfortunately, the HEC has failed in achieving its objectives and has progressively worsened. This failure persists despite the generous grants it has received from the Government (excepting the years 2018-2021) and the operational autonomy it enjoys.”  Mr Iqbal went on to add that during its more than 20 years of existence, the government and international partners sponsored substantial public investments in higher education infrastructure, human resource and faculty development (scholarships, PhDs/Postdocs), accreditation, quality assurance, attestation services, and the National Research Programme for Universities. “Despite these efforts, HEC has failed to achieve its targets,” he regretted.  The minister said that after coming to power in 2022, the PML-N government “re-enhanced” funding for HEC. In 2023 alone, the development budget for HEC included 169 projects with a total cost of Rs446bn and a throw-forward of Rs314bn but the restoration of resource allocation had not resulted in any visible improvements in the state of higher education.  Therefore, given the track record of the current senior HEC team, he was seriously concerned that the public funds allocated to HEC were at risk, and the urgency of educational goals remained unmet.  FPSC’s view  Not only this, the HEC has failed to implement effective quality control measures to enhance the employability of graduates. He said the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) had also pointed out that only 393 candidates or 1.94pc could pass written examinations out of at least 20,000 candidates.   “The FPSC has been continually complaining about the falling standards of our education over several years,” he said, adding that many candidates were not even familiar with elementary mathematics and many others did not even know the direction of a simple compass, confusing north with south and east with west.  Almost all reports of the FPSC, he said, complained about the absence of analytical skills among the candidates who mostly reproduce “crammed knowledge” but there had been insufficient attention to curriculum reforms and pedagogical changes.  ‘Centre-provinces disconnect’  “Investments in HR development have been random and lack targeted outcomes. Research funds have often been used by faculty members to enhance their CVs rather than solve problems and provide evidence-based public policy,” the minister claimed and complained that universities across the provinces suffered from a lack of resources, poor governance, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation. Additionally, there is a clear federal and provincial disconnect in the higher education sector and among the research community.  The planning minister deplored that there were 28,000 Pakistani citizens enrolled in higher education institutions in China but the HEC is clueless about meeting the HR and skills requirements for CPEC projects. Numerous examples of compromised HEC actions exist, such as unjust team-building processes and whimsical resource allocations.  Mr Iqbal alleged that HEC had failed to conceive and implement strategic projects like the US-Pakistan Knowledge Corridor and University Performance Audits effectively and targets remain unmet.  He said the current administrative stalemate at HEC was primarily due to the incumbent senior management.  “The current chairman has held key positions since 2004, making him the longest-serving head of such an organisation. Despite repeated extensions, the promised outcomes have not materialised, and he bears significant responsibility for the sector’s. malaise.   “Moreover, the recruitments to senior positions in HEC were made on nepotism,” the minister alleged and demanded reforms in the higher education sector through the introduction of a fresh, experienced team with a bold vision and the courage to implement necessary changes.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Issuing strict orders against corrupt elements in the distribution companies (Discos), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday expressed his government’s resolve to stop electricity theft, reduce line losses, and improve the power distribution system across the county. Presiding over a meeting held to review the matters of the power ministry, he said new board chairpersons and members had been appointed recently in five distribution companies through a transparent process, hoping that Discos’ performance would improve after these appointments.  PM Shehbaz directed the power minister and secretary coordinate with the provinces on measures aimed at halting the electricity theft, improving the performance of Discos and other related issues. “A whole of the government approach should be adopted to resist power theft across the country,” he said. The premier directed the provincial governments to maintain the number of police personnel and tehsildars as per the Discos’ needs.  Asks provincial govts to maintain police strength as per Discos’ needs  The prime minister’s assertions came days after PML-N President Nawaz Sharif announced a Rs14 per unit reduction in the bills of those consuming 200-500 units electricity in Punjab for two months. The prime minister ordered the authorities concerned to deal with corrupt elements in Discos with an iron hand and take strict action against them. He directed Discos to make the kutchehri system more effective and result-oriented with respect to public complaints. He said the steering committee formed in connection with switching of agricultural tube-wells to solar energy in Balochistan must hold its meeting immediately. The meeting was informed that standard operating procedures regarding the transfer of agricultural tube-wells in Balochistan to solar energy had been notified to the steering committee.  It was further informed that a package was being prepared to acknowledge officers who had shown good performance. Published in Dawn, August 19th, 2024 "

  "description": "LONDON / LAHORE: More than a week after the UK witnessed widespread riots in the aftermath of the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport, law enforcement agencies in Pakistan are probing claims that the disinformation originated from a website that also has a footprint in Pakistan. Recent reports aired by UK media identified a little-known platform, Channel3Now, as being the source of the disinformation that claimed the British-born 17-year-old suspect was a Muslim immigrant, who had arrived in the UK on a boat. However, the assertion by UK broadcaster ITV News that a Pakistani individual was the originator of the false news story has been questioned, both by local law enforcement and other UK media outlets. Lahore Deputy Inspector General (Operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn they were analysing the claims made by UK broadcaster ITV News and had initiated a probe.  No official word on whether UK authorities have sought assistance from Pakistan  There has been no official word, both from UK and Pakistani authorities, about any formal contacts between the two governments on the issue. But sources in local law enforcement say that the person identified in the ITV report was a freelancer working for the website, which aggregates crime-related news from UK and the US and republishes the stories for the sake of clicks and advertising revenue. The BBC report, which tracked down several people linked to Channel3Now, also endorses the view that the platform appears to be “a commercial operation attempting to aggregate crime news while making money on social media”. It recruits freelance writers from several countries, including Pakistan and India. The BBC traced the people behind Channel3Now, including individuals in Pakistan, Canada and the US. It also named an individual linked to the platform, Kevin, who said there are “more than 30” people in the US, UK, Pakistan and India who work for the site, which usually recruits freelancers. But the subsequent ITV report, which included a doorstep interview confronting Farhan Asif — the Lahore-based contributor for Channel3Now — painted him as playing “a significant role in a network of news websites that have promoted falsehoods”. It noted, however, that Channel3Now regularly publishes sensational news stories under the pretense of being an American-style TV channel. The BBC, in contrast, quoted Kevin as saying that Farhan Asif in particular was not involved in the false Southport story, which the site has publicly apologised for, and blamed “our UK-based team”. It is also worth mentioning that although the freelancer is referred to as a journalist in some reports, journalistic circles in Lahore say they’ve never heard of him. Wider disinfo network Despite claims of Russian backing for the website, the BBC could not verify any direct links between Channel3Now and Moscow either. However, the report did confirm that pro-Kremlin channels had amplified the website’s false stories, further fueling unrest in the UK . BBC News’ disinformation correspondent Marianna Spring noted: “I did not find any evidence to substantiate claims that Channel3Now’s misinformation could be linked to the Russian state. [A] person claiming to be from Channel3Now‘s management told me that the publication of the false name “shouldn’t have happened, but it was an error, not intentional”. Although no direct links with that operation have been proven, some observers say this website may be linked to the Srivastava Group, an Indian company that ran a vast network of anti-Pakistan fake news websites, which was unearthed by the EU DisinfoLab in a 2019 investigation. Although many of the websites that were part of this disinformation network have been disbanded since they were exposed, it is possible that the same people are operating a new set of websites for similar purposes.

  "description": "• Tarar terms it ‘worst example’ of hostility towards country • PML-N’s Talal says PTI severely damaged economic, political landscape ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar strongly condemned the so-called “Faiz-Niazi nexus” on Sunday, describing their decisions as the “worst example” of hostility towards the country. Also, senior PML-N leader Senator Talal Chaudhry accused the PTI government of severely damaging the country’s economic and political landscape during its four-year tenure. In a statement issued on Sunday, Mr Tarar lambasted the alleged alliance between PTI founder Imran Khan and former intelligence chief Faiz Hameed. He accused them of making decisions detrimental to national interests, including alleged connections with anti-Pakistan journalists across the eastern border and the resettlement of extremist elements from the western border. Mr Tarar’s statement came days after the military arrested the former spy chief for alleged misconduct in a case related to a private housing scheme. The military later arrested three more retired officers in connection with the investigation into allegations against Mr Hameed, who currently faces a court martial on charges of corruption and misuse of power. The information minister also expressed grave concern over a conversation that surfaced earlier in the day between PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan and an Indian journalist, claiming it fully exposed the PTI’s anti-state agenda. The minister branded PTI as a “foreign-funded party” committed to an anti-national agenda, accusing the party of seeking the support of its “foreign masters” to undermine the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty after harming its foreign policy through the cipher conspiracy. He alleged that Mr Hasan’s conversation with the Indian journalist, known for holding anti-Pakistan sentiments, reflected the PTI’s ideology that he claimed has been involved in various conspiracies against the state, including the May 9 violence. Mr Tarar accused the PTI’s social media cell in Islamabad of being in constant contact with enemies of the state, running a smear campaign against the Pakistan Army and its leadership. He claimed that the party’s calls for a “bloody revolution” indicated foreign funding from India, which was revealed during investigations into the PTI’s prohibited funding case. He accused the party of crossing all limits of anti-nationalism and seeking to harm the national interests and the army. Mr Tarar also implicated Faiz Hameed in the alleged conspiracy, accusing him of being a “stooge” of the PTI founder and attempting to create instability in the country. He alleged that Mr Hameed was the agent of Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, who was “a central figure in all these conspiracies”. He stressed that the “Faiz-Niazi-Bushra nexus” had worked against the country’s interests, inciting rebellion within state institutions and attempting to create an impression of discord within the ranks of the Pakistan Army. ‘PTI damaged economic landscape’ Separately, Senator Talal Chaudhry accused the PTI government of damaging the country’s economic and political landscape during its four-year tenure. Reacting to the alleged conversation between PTI leader Raoof Hasan and an Indian journalist, Mr Chaudhry claimed that Mr Hasan had been in contact with anti-Pakistan foreign journalists, including those from India. He further alleged that PTI members were advising the International Monetary Fund (IMF) against making deals with Pakistan and that Mr Hasan was sharing sensitive material with anti-Pakistan journalists. Mr Chaudhry argued that the chaos along with politics of divide and rule plaguing the country was not the job of a single individual as it involved various politicians, parties and even elements within state institutions. He suggested that the efforts to weaken Pakistan were orchestrated by multiple actors and asserted that there would be “zero tolerance” for such anti-state elements.

  "description": "• Flash floods sweep away several bridges, homes; rail services suspended in most parts • Major rivers swell, threatening settlements in Sibi, Nasirabad, other areas                     QUETTA: Heavy rains and thunderstorms have claimed three lives in Balochistan, rendering hundreds of people without shelter, while raging flash floods have swept away roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. The downpour, which has been lashing the province for three days, picked up steam on Sunday, prompting flash floods which collapsed dozens of mud houses and disrupted power and communication systems.  According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), due to rainfall in Kalat, Ziarat, Zhob and Quetta, there is a risk of urban flooding in several parts of Balochistan over the next couple of days. Reports from across the province said floods swept away bridges, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded on roads.  Also, railway tracks in Chaman, Harnai, Noshki and Dera Allah Yar have been submerged causing the suspension of train service.  The Chaman-bound passenger train was suspended after the railway track came under water in the Shella Bagh area of Chaman. Due to the recent monsoon rains, the Sibi-Harnai railway section has remained closed since July 21.  Floodwater also washed away the Quetta-Taftan section near Noshki, resulting in the suspension of the train service. The Jaffar Express, travelling from Rawalpindi to Quetta, was halted in Jacobabad, but eventually departed for Quetta after a delay of two and a half hours. Two shepherds killed In Khuzdar’s Sarona area, a lightning strike killed two shepherds and almost a dozen goats. They were identified as Mohammad Ismail and Moha­mmad Imran. The Shahdadkot-Khuzdar Road in the Wangu mountainous area had been closed due to landslides caused by heavy rains. In the Kirdgab area of Mastung, a flash flood swept away a woman while she was trying to cross a bridge. The authorities, however, managed to recover the body later. Rivers in high flood All the rivers in the province, including Bolan, Nari Gaj, Lehri, and Mola, were in high flood, threatening settlements in Sibi, Kachhi, Nasirabad, Jhal Magsi, Bakhtiarabad, Bhag, Dera Allah Yar, and Dera Murad Jamali.  In Nasirabad district, hill torrents from the mountainous area of Dera Bugti posed a threat to the Pat Feeder Canal and other canals in the district. In Dera Allah Yar, rain over the past two days caused widespread devastation, inundating streets as well as the district headquarters hospital. The train service was also suspended after the track was submerged. In Kohlu, rains flooded the low-lying areas of the district and sections of the Kohlu-Sibi National Highway had been closed, severing the land connection between Kohlu and several neighbouring districts in Balochistan and Sindh.  According to a report by the PDMA, three people were injured in Kohlu due to house collapse. Heavy rainfall in Bolan and Mach led to flooding in low-lying areas of the Bolan National Highway, stranding hundreds of vehicles.   Ali Jan Mangi in Nasirabad  and Abdul Wahid in Khuzdar also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, August 19th, 2024 "

  "content": "Sindh's Sukkur city has received devastating rains this monsoon season which broke the \"77-year record\" of the city with 290mm rains in a single day. In 2022, 374mm of rain had been recorded in 12 days, while in the current spell, Sukkur recorded 290mm of rainfall in just a single day, an official statement issued by the provincial authorities claimed on Sunday. Earlier on Monday, Sardar Sarfaraz, chief meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), rejected the claim regarding the record-breaking rainfall in Sukkur, terming it \"wrong\". \"116mm of rain was recorded in Sukkur in 48 hours. Rohri near Sukkur recorded 134mm rainfall,\" he said, speaking with Geo News. The Sindh government spokesperson and Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh said that the dewatering process was completed in 80% of areas of the city. He added that the work was also in progress in the remaining areas and that life in the city would be back to normal in a few hours. Sheikh further said that the Sukkur Municipal Corporation had completed the necessary arrangements for the timely dewatering of rainwater in advance, including the upgradation of disposal stations, and installation of heavy generators and relevant machinery in 57 low-lying areas. He added that rainwater inundated Old Sukkur, Ghanta Ghar and other areas, however, timely action brought the situation under control. Weather-related disasters are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global greenhouse gases yet is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2022, catastrophic flooding plunged a third of the country underwater, killing over 1,700 people, displacing 33 million and destroying thousands of homes."

  "content": "KARACHI: A whale shark, rare species of fish, has been spotted near Charna Island in Karachi, the Pakistan Boat Rally and Fishing Association (PBRFA) told Geo News on Monday. Members of the PBRFA shot videos of the whale shark with an underwater camera and swam with it for about 20 minutes. Depth around Charna Island is between 20 and 60 feet, which makes it a rich area for marine life.  Whale sharks and whales often visit this region in search of food, especially during the winter or after the monsoon season, when minerals from the mountains are washed into the sea by the Hub River, enriching the waters, the PBRFA said in a handout. PBRFA President Ahmed Mamoor Amimi said the sighting was a \"gift to all Pakistanis\" and congratulated Manan Sheikh, a member of the association, for showcasing the beauty of Pakistan’s waters. As per the fishing association, around 150,000 whale sharks are left worldwide as it is an endangered species globally. Whale shark, which is found along Pakistan’s coastal line, is called Andhi Mangar in Sindhi and Baraan in Balochi. It gives birth to baby fish in the north of Charna Island. The fish used to be hunted until 1970, but now fishermen are striving to protect its species."

  "content": "As millions across Pakistan continue to face intermittent internet disruptions which have had an adverse effect on both communications and businesses, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) has decried the government's unforthcoming attitude and lack of consultation on the issue. \"We want to work with them [government]. What such need arose that we have been thrown out of the loop,\" P@SHA Senior Vice Chairman Ali Ihsan said while speaking on Geo News'  programme \"Geo Pakistan\" on Monday. His remarks come against the backdrop of prevailing issues faced by people and businesses due to either slow internet speed or restricted access which the experts link to increased security and surveillance owing to the installation of a firewall to control unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. The internet firewall in question provisions filters that will block unwanted content from reaching the masses and will be used to inspect information originating from different internet protocol addresses. There will be a keyword filtering system to detect content the government considers undesirable or prejudicial to national security etc, and such posts will likely be camouflaged and will subsequently be made invisible to outside users.  This filter will run its check on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter).  Meanwhile, preparation is also in progress to prevent the \"misuse\" of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as the government can declare it mandatory for citizens to inform the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) about the virtual private networks (VPNs) they are using.  However, the government, while rebuking allegations that it was responsible for internet slowdown, has attributed the issue to the use of VPNs.  \"I can swear that the government of Pakistan did not block the internet or slow it down [....] Turning VPN on slows down the phone,\" she said during a press conference in Islamabad on Sunday. Elaborating on the issue, the P@SHA official recalled that no issue had arisen in the past 10 years as they were kept in the loop and questioned as to what such need had emerged that they were excluded from the policy matters. \"P@SHA and the PTA had previously held discussions on ban on VPN where we advised them how businesses can be protected [...] if we were to be taken into confidence this time we would've told them to whitelist IT businesses and not subject them to internet firewall as our IPs are tracked via identification records,\" Ihsan said. \"We cannot guide them with solutions if the information isn't shared with us [....] If we are taken on board now we would advise them to disable certain things for two weeks and release it after thorough testing,\" the P@SHA representative noted. Stressing that at least some filtering mechanism was in place for the past 10 years he questioned what had happened exactly this time that the businesses have been affected. Commenting on the economic impact of the internet disruptions, he revealed that P@SHA estimates a loss of $300 million loss in light of existing complaints by the businesses and the reputational damage. \"If someone was giving you a business of $10-15 million and now decides against it then other clients will also raise questions in future [before giving you business. \"No matter how good your relations are [...] clients would not give you business if they got to know there some issue with the internet,\" he noted. Underscoring the internet slowdown's effect on businesses, Ihsan said that leading Information Technology companies have complained that 40% of their BPO services have been affected. We have it on record that a leading healthcare company whose business in Pakistan might be around $50 million and conducts its business primarily in the United States, its 200 lines were down for one week, whereas another has complained of losing contracts and losses in their core line of business, the P@SHA official noted. \"I myself was negotiating a contract worth $500,000 when my virtual call dropped for about one and a half hours,\" he decried. Reacting to Minister Shaza Khawaja's remarks regarding the use of VPNs, he questioned as to how many people can be using the tool at the same time. He also noted that there is a likelihood that the internet firewall itself was bypassing the content delivery networks (CDNs) due to which [internet] traffic is being choked  \"We fear that certain technology was being used whose lack of proper integration will prevent this issue from being solved in the short term altogether,\" the association's senior vice chairman said. Calling on the government to address the internet issue, the Pakistan Freelancers Association (PAFLA) said that there had been an internet slowdown and disruptions for the past three weeks. PAFLA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tufail Ahmed Khan revealed that as many as 2.3 million freelancers in Pakistan have been facing difficulties in delivering their work on time to clients. \"There is a chance that our [Pakistan's] rating will be downgraded over [freelancers'] failure to deliver on time,\" Khan said, adding that the internet shutdown was not only creating problems for freelancers but was also affecting the country's economy as well."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Torrential rains claimed at least 195 lives and injured 362 persons in separate rain-related incidents across the country from July 1 to August 17, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in its report released on Sunday. The disaster management authority elaborated on the devastation caused by continued wet spells, which resulted in a great loss of lives, properties, crops and livestock since the beginning of the monsoon season. According to the report, seven deaths were reported within the 24 hours till Saturday, August 17, 2024, including six deaths in Punjab and one in Balochistan. The total number of deaths has soared to 195 with today’s casualty figures. Subsequently, at least 30 persons sustained injuries in the same period, with the highest number of casualties reported in Punjab, up to 29. The total number of injuries caused by the devastating rains was recorded at 362.   The NDMA further stated that the recently released death toll was reconciled with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Balochistan which experienced disastrous outcomes of heavy rainfalls this season. Flash floods after heavy rains in low-lying areas caused damage to a total of 22 houses across the country in a day, taking the cumulative damages to infrastructure and private properties 2,293, including 1,559 partially and 734 fully damaged from July 1 to August 18. The wet spells have also affected over 44km of roads and 30 bridges in the same period. In a relevant development, the NDMA's National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) anticipated that more monsoon rains are expected to hit different parts of the country from August 18 (evening/night) to August 19 with occasional gaps. Consequently, heavy downpours may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar from 18th & 19th August. The authority issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather. Weather-related disasters are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global greenhouse gases yet is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2022, catastrophic flooding plunged a third of the country underwater, killing over 1,700 people, displacing 33 million and destroying thousands of homes."

Presiding over a meeting held here to review matters of the Power Division, the premier directed the federal minister for power and power division secretary  to coordinate with the provinces with respect to halting electricity theft, performance of Discos and other matters of the sector.  During the meeting, he expressed the government's resolve to stop electricity theft, reduce line losses, and improve power distribution companies across the county.  Recently, the prime minister said, the government had appointed new board of chairmen and members in five Discos through a transparent process, hoping that these appointments would further improve the companies' performance. “A whole-of-the-government approach should be adopted to resist power theft across the country,” PM Shehbaz said. He directed the provincial governments to maintain the number of police force and tehsildars as per the Discos’ needs. He directed the distribution companies to make the kutchehri system more effective and result-oriented with respect to the public complaints. PM Shehbaz said the meeting of the steering committee that was formed in connection with the shifting of agriculture tube wells to solar energy in Balochistan, should be called immediately. The meeting was apprised that the standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding the transfer of agricultural tube wells in Balochistan to solar energy had been notified to the steering committee. It was further informed that a package was being prepared regarding acknowledgement of officers who had shown good performance. The meeting was attended by federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Power Awais Khan Leghari and other officers of the relevant ministries and divisions."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Barrister Salman Akram Raja on Sunday claimed that 'many bridges' would collapse if Punjab election tribunals, nominated by Lahore High Court (LHC) chief justice, hear the electoral disputes. Addressing a presser here, the PTI leader — who had lost his election from NA-128 Lahore — criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for attempting to change Punjab election tribunals. \"The people of Pakistan cannot forget the February 8 general elections, wherein the worst rigging took place,\" he alleged. Raja claimed that the election tribunals in Punjab, appointed by the LHC chief justice, were not allowed to function. However, he noted, election tribunals in other provinces functioned as per the list provided by the respective chief justices. \"They [the government] fear the most in Punjab,\" he said, claiming that 'many bridges' will collapse if the tribunals — appointed by the LHC chief justice — hear the disputes. Moreover, the PTI leader said, the one who creates differences between the institutions and people is 'Pakistan's enemy'. For her part, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi — who also lost the Multan NA-151 seat — said that the democracy's strength lies in women's representation, regretting that only three women leaders were representing the party in Parliament. It is pertinent to mention here that Salman Akram Raja had filed a review petition with the Supreme Court of Pakistan, seeking to make functional the Election Tribunal in Punjab. A five-member larger bench of the apex court headed by the CJP would also take up the appeal of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) against the LHC judgement, appointing eight election tribunals in Punjab for addressing elections disputes from the February 8 general elections. The other members of the bench include Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. Previously, on July 4, the Supreme Court had suspended the LHC judgement and its notification regarding the appointment of eight election tribunals in Punjab. This suspension was in effect until the completion of consultations between the LHC chief justice and ECP. On the other side, President Asif Ali Zardari — on July 9 — approved the Election (Amendment) Bill 2024, empowering the electoral watchdog to appoint retired judges of high courts to election tribunals. Under the amendment to the Elections Act, 2017, the ECP would not need consultation with the respective chief justices for the appointment of retired judges as election tribunals."

APP/FileReacting to recently revealed alleged connections between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's  leader Raoof Hasan and an Indian journalist, federal Minister for Information and...",
  "content": "Reacting to recently revealed alleged connections between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) leader Raoof Hasan and an Indian journalist, federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar has condemned the former ruling party, saying that these contacts with the neighbouring country's media person have exposed the Imran Khan-founded party. The minister said this on Sunday after detained PTI's information secretary's contacts with an Indian journalist came to the fore. He said that the PTI has been spearheading the India-sponsored agenda in the country. Hasan was arrested on July 22, the day when Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry called on the nation to stand up against militants and \"digital terrorists\". The PTI leader was arrested by the Islamabad police from the party's Central Secretariat for heading a digital media cell allegedly involved in running propaganda against Pakistan and its integrity. \"The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,\" police said, announcing Hasan's arrest — who was later handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). The same month, he was transferred to the custody of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the police for interrogation in a terrorism case. In his statement issued earlier today, the information minister said that the former ruling party was using its social media cell to run a campaign against the Pakistan Army, adding that the investigation [with Hasan] has unearthed how the Indians bankrolled the PTI from abroad. Tarar called the PTI a \"foreign-funded\" party, saying the PTI caused harm to the country's foreign policy through a cipher. The party, he added, is using \"its foreign lords\" to harm national integrity. Commenting further on the recent revelation of Hasan's contact with the Indian journalist, the politico stressed that Hasan [in his messages to the Indian journalist] mirrored his party's approach. \"The PTI's social media cell was a major source of connections with the country's enemies. Now, we can understand why the May 9 attacks were launched,\" he added. The federal minister further said that the \"foreign-funded coterie\" had crossed all limits of animosity against the country, as the party's real objective was to damage Pakistan's national interests and its army. Condemning the PTI, he said the Imran-founded party's followers are fulfilling the Indian agenda while living in Pakistan and they brought terrorists back to the country to complete the Indian agenda. Tarar also said that \"Faiz-Niazi-Bushra collusion\" did harm the country for their nefarious designs. The military earlier last week announced that the ex-director-general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) General (retd) Faiz Hamid had been taken into custody over allegations of land-grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and a process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated against him. The retired general turned out to be a pawn of the PTI founder to kick up political instability in the country, he said, adding that the 'Faiz-Niazi connection' tried to create the impression that there is some sort of rift in the military.

  "content": "Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Talal Chaudhry said on Sunday that the accountability process would be followed by all national institutions after the precedent set by the Pakistan Army by initiating an internal scrutiny of its top officers. \"The accountability process has started in Pakistan after 75 years,\" said Chaudhry in a statement today while pointing towards arrests and probe against former spymaster Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid and other ex-servicemen. He said that political parties would also have to start the process of internal accountability.   The senator of the ruling party alleged that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Information Secretary Raoof Hasan was \"providing material to anti-Pakistan journalists\" and he was not alone but there was an organised planning behind the moves. The PML-N stalwart went on to say that all other institutions, like the Pakistan Army, would have to kick-start accountability in the country as no one was beyond it. Taking aim at the judiciary, he claimed that former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar had been in contact with the ex-ISI chief [during his tenure] but he was denying the facts today. \"The decisions taken under the leadership of Nisar had brought Pakistan to this [deteriorated] situation.\" The politico, who served as a federal parliamentary secretary during the rule of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif from 2013 to 2017, said that the economy was moving in the right direction and no compromise would be made on Pakistan’s integrity. He blamed the former ruling party led by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan for isolating the country on the diplomatic front and making deliberate moves to displease the global allies of Pakistan. Later in the day, Chaudhry, speaking to Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, claimed that the federal government was determined to make it possible the continuation of the accountability process in the country. He added that the May 9 riots that erupted after the arrest of the PTI founder in 2023 were \"not unplanned\" and the government would not tolerate such events. The violent protests saw attacks on the government and military installations across the country. The politico termed last year's mayhem a \"failed rebellion\" and alleged that the former ruling party was still owning its May 9 narrative. The lawmaker further signalled that the incumbent government would be bound to take concrete steps if institutions show reluctance to start accountability against those people who destabilised the country. Chaudhry's remarks came in a series of statements delivered by the ruling party’s ministers following the military's August 12 announcement regarding the arrest of the country's former top spy Faiz over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, and the initiation of a process of Field General Court Martial against him. Another three retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest. A day ago, Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar said that more big fish would be netted following Faiz’s arrest as the scope of the investigation will expand. Tarar had said that the military had its mechanism of self-accountability and recent arrests were done after transparent investigations. \"Be it Saqib or Nisar, the scope of the investigation will expand as things unfold after the arrest of Gen Faiz,\" the federal minister said while referring to the former chief justice of Pakistan, who was accused of favouring the PTI founder. The military had said in a statement that Gen Faiz was arrested because there were \"multiple instances of violation\" of the Army Act by him after his retirement in December 2022. \"The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid has been taken into military custody,\" it added. The army had also said it acted against the top officer in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court, which last year called for an investigation against him after a land development company called Top City filed a petition, alleging he had acquired ownership of some properties along with his brother and had even blackmailed the company's owner."

  "content": "KARACHI: Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori on Sunday demanded Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah allocate funds from the provincial budget for Punjab-like subsidy in electricity bills. \"Sindh CM [Murad Ali Shah], like Punjab, should provide a relief of Rs14 per unit in electricity bills,\" the governor said, fearing that its denial may lead to a sense of despair among the people in Sindh. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Nawaz Sharif announced the two-month power subsidy relief for Punjab citizens two days ago which would be given to consumers using up to 500 units in August and September bills.   Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also welcomed the \"historic\" relief package for electricity consumers by the Punjab chief minister. The move drew criticism from other provinces with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) decrying the 'use of provincial card' in electricity-related issues. Meanwhile, Governor Tessori cited the Punjab government's example and asked CM Shah to allocate funds from the provincial budget for relief to the people. He also expressed concern over the catastrophic consequences following the torrential rain in parts of Sindh, noting that the people have been deprived of their homes due to the destruction. \"We are sending ration bags for the rain-hit people in parts of the province,\" Tessori said, announcing that he would also undertake a visit to such areas. However, he clarified, that not a single penny of the provincial government was spent on the functions at the Governor House. Even the cash prize given to Arshad Nadeem, who won a gold medal in the Javelin Throw, didn't include funds from the Sindh government.  On July 15, PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government jacked up the base tariff for domestic consumers to up to Rs48.84 per unit. The hike in electricity price, as per the notification issued by the Power Division, also includes consumers in Karachi, however, it will not apply to consumers using up to 200 units per month who have been exempted from the increase for three months. The hike in tariff came after the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved the federal government’s request seeking up to Rs7.12 per unit hike in electricity base tariff for domestic consumers last week."

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Amid rumours of rift between party leaders, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) incarcerated founder Imran Khan has directed Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar to meet him at Rawalpindi's Adiala jail.  Speaking to Geo News on Sunday, Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the development and said that Khan has expressed concerned over the \"impression\" of grouping in the party. The confirmation as the former ruling party has been facing internal turmoil after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Communication and Works Shakeel Ahmad Khan resigned over alleged corruption and bad governance by the CM Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province.  The resignation came after Shakeel, during his meeting with Khan in Adiala jail, complained about embezzlement in various departments of KP following which the ex-prime minister warned members of his party’s government in KP that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. The party then constituted a three-member committee to monitor corruption and governance in KP. Sources privy to the matter said that Shakeel alleged that he was unable to perform his duties properly due to the corruption and bad governance in the province and alleged that CM Gandapur’s interference in his department was affecting his performance.  In response, the KP chief minister revealed that he had signed a summary seeking Shakeel's de-notification on the committee's recommendation. The issue has caused a rift among party leadership with Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar putting their weight behind Shakeel which apparently didn't sit well with the KP government which has denotified the latter as CM Gandapur's focal person, The News reported on Sunday. Elaborating on the issue, Barrister Saif said that the PTI founder had directed Akbar's name to be included in the accountability committee and who was removed from the body at a later stage. Sources say that both the PTI leaders are expected to meet Khan next week after the KP government had complained of the duo. Speaking to the media persons in Islamabad earlier in the day, the KP CM's adviser recalled that \"some people\" had complained of corruption in KP to Khan after which the former premier held meetings with Gandapur and various others and conveyed a message stressing no tolerance for corruption. When I met the PTI founder he said that he would form a committee and noted that the forum would decide on the complaints, Saif said. Commenting on Ahmad's removal, the KP government spokesperson noted that the committee found former provincial minister guilty of the complaints that were levelled against him. \"Ahmad resigned before his dismissal [....] The matter should have ended after the resignation [but] an impression was given that there were differences in the party,\" said Saif. Recalling his meeting with the incarcerated PTI founder on Saturday, he said: \"[Imran] Khan has said that if anyone has any objection then [he should know] that I have formed the committee.\""

  "description": "At least 19 people were killed, 11 injured, and over 3,000 were affected as the ongoing monsoon rains, which began on July 1, continued to wreak havoc across various parts of Balochistan on Monday, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). Monsoon rains across the region from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies and sustaining agriculture, but also lead to weather-related disasters. Experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. Data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) shows that from July 1 to August 17, 195 people have been killed and 362 injured across the country due to rain-related incidents, while 2,293 houses have been damaged.            View this post on Instagram              PDMA data for today showed that from July 1 till now, 19 people died, 11 were injured, 3,031 were affected and 433 houses were fully or partially destroyed. PDMA official Yunus Mengal told Dawn.com that 16 districts of Balochistan were affected by the recent spell of rain while relief was being provided. “Balochistan has witnessed two dangerous spells of monsoon since July 1,” Mengal said. Balochistan’s provincial government has imposed an emergency in many union councils of the districts of Kalat, Ziarat, Awaran, Kachhi, Loralai, Sohbatpur and Lasbela, declaring them calamity-hit. The highest rainfall was recorded in Kalat with over 48 millimetres, followed by Usta Muhammad with 34mm, and Sibbi with 21mm. Quetta and Khuzdar recorded 10mm of rain each, while Zhob and Chaman recorded 9mm of rain. Sohbatpur’s Deputy Commissioner Farida Tareen said that a river in Judair overflowed due to the rain, inundating the area and destroying rice fields. Meanwhile, Balochistan’s National Highway Authority General Manager Agha Inayatullah clarified that all the national highways in north Balochistan were open for all kinds of traffic, with the authority and contractors “working round the clock to rectify damages” of the flood water and keep the roads open. Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti also announced a cash reward to a vehicle driver for immediately rescuing a family trapped in the flood relay in the Killa Abdullah area. CM Bugti said the driver showed bravery and courage by saving the lives of women and children and setting a fine example of service to the people. He said that those who served society selflessly were real heroes. He also announced a certificate of appreciation and cash reward to the driver for his act.         In the summer of 2022, Pakistan experienced one of the most devastating floods in the country due to torrential rains, killing 1,700 people, affecting 33 million individuals, and destroying houses and swathes of agricultural land, according to governmental figures. Sindh and Balochistan were the most heavily impacted provinces. In Balochistan alone, 336 people lost their lives, 426,897 homes were damaged or destroyed, and 1,230 square kilometres (304,000 acres) of crops were lost. Additionally, approximately half a million livestock were killed. Politicians react to loss of life Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives and property caused by heavy rains and floods in various parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a message, he extended his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, stating that he shared their grief during this difficult time. Gilani offered prayers for the swift recovery of those injured and urged the relevant authorities to expedite their relief efforts. He emphasised that natural disasters were a global challenge, and their negative impacts could only be mitigated through collective efforts. Highlighting the challenges Pakistan faced due to climate change, he advised people to take precautionary measures during the rainy season.         Senate Deputy Chairman Senator Syedaal Khan too shared similar sentiments. In a message, he said that witnessing the devastation caused by the rains was heartbreaking and he stood in solidarity with the victims in their time of grief. He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and emphasised the need to accelerate rescue and relief operations. He also called on philanthropists to come forward and support the affected people during this challenging time. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman expressed regret over the deaths from rain-related incidents, saying it was a “pity that Pakistan is once again in the grip of the effects of climate change”. “Abnormal monsoon rains have wreaked havoc once again,” she said. “This monsoon spell is likely to continue till August 25, so all concerned institutions need to be alert to avoid further losses.”         "

  "description": "Three soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces foiled an infiltration attempt at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the military’s media wing said on Monday. A press release by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “On night August 18/19, 2024, movement of a group of khwarij (outcasts), who were trying to infiltrate Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces in Bajaur district. “Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. Resultantly, five khwarij of Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell, while four khwarij got injured.” The government labelled the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan Fitna al Khawarij earlier this month. The ISPR said 36-year-old Naik Inayat Khan, resident of Khyber district Khyber; 35-year-old Lance Naik Umer Hayat, resident of Mansehra district and 25-year-old Sepoy Waqar Khan, resident of Peshawar district fought “gallantly” during the exchange of fire and embraced martyrdom. “Pakistan has consistently been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border. Interim Afghan Government is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by khwarij for perpetuating acts of terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said. It added that the security forces remained committed to securing the borders, saying that the sacrifices of brave soldiers only “further strengthen our resolve”. President Asif Ali Zardari expressed regret over the incident and paid tribute to the martyrs. “Martyrs of the nation are the pride of the nation, the whole nation will be grateful. The security forces bravely foiled the infiltration attempt of the terrorists, sent the terrorists to hell. “The entire nation salutes the spirit of patriotism and selflessness of the Pakistan Army. The entire nation pays homage to its martyrs, will not forget the sacrifices,” he said.         Last month, three terrorists were killed by security forces during an infiltration attempt at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in KP’s Dir district. The Pakistan Army previously said that 29 terrorists were killed in a series of operations along the Pak-Afghan border in May, amid a surge in terrorism originating from Afghan soil. The ISPR had noted a surge in attempts by Afghanistan-based terrorists to infiltrate the border and carry out attacks on the Pakistani side. Last week, Army Chief Gen Asim Munir had called on the Afghan Taliban not to prefer the TTP over its long-standing and brotherly neighbour to the east, maintaining that Pakis­tan desired good relations with its Western neighbour.

  "description": "Pakistan reported another suspected case of the mpox virus on Monday while the health ministry said that the new strain linked to an outbreak in Africa was not detected. The health ministry said that one mpox case of the clade 2 variety has been detected in the country, adding that no cases of the clade 1b strain of the disease have been diagnosed. Clade 1b has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. “As of now, there have been no reported cases of clade I in Pakistan,” said Sajid Hussain Shah, spokesman for the Ministry of National Health Services.      The mpox diagnosis in a 34-year-old man who recently returned from a Gulf country was declared by health officials on Friday while testing over the exact strain was carried out. “The virus has been classified as Clade 2b,” the health ministry said in a statement today. “Currently, the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is primarily associated with Clade 1b. Notably, as of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan.” Meanwhile, Dr Naseem Akhtar, the focal person at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), told Dawn.com that a 47-year-old traveller from the Middle East was referred today by the airport authorities to Pims on suspicion of being infected with mpox. Dr Akhtar said a sample was sent to the National Institutes of Health and contact tracing would be initiated if the patient tested positive. He added that the individual was working as a labourer in the Middle East and was a resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. The WHO last week sounded its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the DRC spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in DRC since the current outbreak began in January 2023. Global health officials last week confirmed an infection with the new strain of mpox in Sweden and linked it to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO did not urge any travel restrictions to curb the spread of mpox. The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, and children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications. Philippines detects first case this year, yet to determine strain Separately, the Philippines detected a new case of the mpox virus in the country, the first since December last year, its health department said, adding it was awaiting test results before being able to determine the strain. The patient was a 33-year-old Filipino male who had no travel history outside the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said. “We are awaiting sequencing results and will update once available,” its spokesperson Albert Domingo said when asked about the strain. The new case in the Philippines is the 10th laboratory-confirmed case the health department has detected. Its first case was in July 2022. “Symptoms started more than a week ago with fever, which was followed four days later by findings of a distinct rash on the face, back, nape, trunk, groin, as well as palms and soles,” the Philippine DOH said in a statement.

  "description": "The Supreme Court on Monday suspended the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) orders in the audio leaks case related to Bushra Bibi, wife of former premier Imran Khan, and Najam Saqib, the son of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar. During a hearing today, conducted by a two-member bench comprising Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, the top court restrained the IHC from taking any further action in the audio leaks case and declared that the orders it issued on May 29 and June 25 were beyond its ambit. On May 29, IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar had barred telecom companies from recording phone calls and data for surveillance purposes. The court had issued the direction: “Till the next date of hearing the intelligence agencies, including, inter alia, the ISI and IB, and police authorities will not surveil any citizens, except in accordance with requirements of the Fair Trial Act and warrants duly issued by a judge of the high court, and neither PTA nor the telecom companies shall authorise the use of their services or equipment for purposes of any surveillance or interception of phone calls or data.” The order had virtually handicapped the intelligence and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in probing crimes and terrorist monitoring as the court stopped cellular companies from sharing citizens’ data with agencies. On June 25, the IHC had reserved its verdict on the Islamabad police’s request to allow surveillance of suspects. In a subsequent verdict, the IHC had allowed cellular companies to share with police data related to suspects for investigation in the post-crime scenario, restraining telecom operators from facilitating LEAs with surveillance.      The verdict also noted that telecom companies operating in Pakistan were running a mass surveillance system that “enables interception of data and records of telecom customers” without any regulatory mechanism or legal procedures, on the PTA’s orders. Justice Sattar had earlier dismissed multiple petitions from different authorities requesting that he recuse himself from the case. “The IHC’s orders of May 29 and June 25 are beyond its authority,” the SC ruled today, adding that the court was “not authorised to take suo moto notices”. The SC issued notices to Bushra Bibi and Najam Saqib and also sought records of the audio leaks case at the request of the federal government. Justice Khan asked Additional Attorney General (AAG) Munawar Iqbal Duggal whether the IHC had determined who was recording the audio, to which the latter affirmed in the negative and said the investigation was still ongoing. “Unfortunately in this country, no one wants to get to the truth,” Justice Afghan lamented. He noted that an inquiry commission was formed to investigate the veracity of audio leaks, but the SC, upon the orders of the previous chief justice, had to stay the decision. “Until today, a date has not been appointed again in the SC for the audio leaks case,” Justice Afghan noted. “When Parliament tried to find out the truth, it was also blocked,” Justice Afghan said. “If both Parliament and the court are not allowed to work, how will the truth come to light?” Justice Khan wondered whether it had been considered that those who are being talked to are the ones leaking the audio tapes since every mobile phone has recording capabilities nowadays.

  "content": "Three soldiers were martyred in a gun battle with terrorists who were trying to infiltrate Pakistan via Afghanistan border near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) district Bajaur, the Inter-Service Public Relation (ISPR) said on Monday. A statement issued by the military's media wing said that on the night between August 18 and 19, the security forces noticed the movement of a group of terrorists trying to breach the Pak-Afghan border. \"Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. Resultantly, five khwarij of Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell, while four khwarij got injured,\" the ISPR said. It said that the Pakistani soldiers fought gallantly and embraced martyrdom. The soldiers, who embraced martyrdom were identified as Sepoy Waqar Khan, 25, Lance Naik Umer Hayat, 35, and Naik Inayat Khan, 36. The ISPR stated that Pakistan has been consistently asking the interim government in Afghanistan to ensure effective border management on their side of the border. \"Interim Afghan government is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by khwarij for perpetuating acts of terrorism against Pakistan,\" it said, adding that the security forces of Pakistan remain committed to secure its borders and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve. On Friday, three terrorists were killed by the security forces during an intelligence-based operation in KP's area of Razmak, the ISPR said. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents were reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "Expressing disappointment with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Sindh government spokesperson and Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh has doubled down on his claim that Sukkur received record-breaking rain on Sunday.  The Sukkur mayor said this in a video statement issued on Monday after Sardar Sarfaraz, the chief meteorologist at the PMD, rejected his claim regarding the record-breaking rainfall on Sunday in the city. The mayor had claimed that Sukkur received 290mm rain in a single day which broke the \"77-year record\" of the city. The PMD's chief meteorologist, however, termed the claim \"wrong\" and told Geo News that \"116mm of rain was recorded in Sukkur in 48 hours. Rohri near Sukkur recorded 134mm rainfall.\" \"I ask the meteorological department whether they have such a system in Sukkur that can accurately measure the rainfall in the city?\" Sheikh said today in response to the chief meteorologist.  He said that the PMD's data is unfortunately based on observation, no authentic system is installed in the city. \"If the PMD has any rain gauge system installed in the city, please share it with us,\" he added.  Sharing the PMD's weather forecast for Sukkur in the month of July, the Sindh government spox said that the department's forecast did not come true even for a single day.  He also shared the PMD's rain forecast for August, according to which the city was predicted to receive 53.5 mm. However, the rain situation in the current month is visible to everybody, he noted.  Sheikh said that here are five taluqas in district Sukkur and the provincial government had installed a rain gauge in each of the taluka where rainfall is measured every three hours.  This data is released to other departments including the CM Portal, he added. Meanwhile, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani also addressed the controversy earlier today, saying that the government has its own system in place to measure downpour in each taluka. However, he added, the PMD has towers in specific areas to measure rain. Ghani backed the district administration’s claim, saying that 281mm rain was recorded in Sukkur city. \"Sukkur received five spells of torrential rains,\" he said."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday suspended the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) order barring the intelligence and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) from phone tapping and data surveillance, which the latter gave in a case related to audio leaks of former first lady Bushra Bibi and Najmul Saqib, son of former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar. The top court also ordered the high court to stop proceedings in the audio leaks case till further orders. A two-member bench of the top court comprising Justice Amin-Ud-Din Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the Centre's appeal against the IHC order in the audio leaks case today. At the outset of the hearing, Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman apprised the apex court that the relevant authorities had been stopped from phone tapping in an IHC order issued on May 29. He further said that the intelligence agencies were unable to perform counterintelligence due to the IHC's ruling which also restricted the agencies from arresting any terrorists. The government’s lawyer said that the high court had also stopped the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) from phone tapping and call data recording (CDR). He added that the high court exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution in contradiction to the top court's two verdicts.  It is worth mentioning that on May 29, IHC's Justice Babar Sattar had barred telecom companies from recording phone calls and data which disabled the intelligence and law enforcement agencies’ surveillance against criminals and terrorists. After the May 29 ruling, the IHC gave a subsequent verdict on the Islamabad police’s plea on June 25 in which the court allowed the telecom companies to share suspects’ data with the police for post-crime probe, however, it restricted the cellular firms from facilitating LEAs with surveillance. The two-member bench remarked that the apex court reviewed the IHC's May 29 order which was not extended in the fresh proceedings, therefore, the top court was not suspending the said ruling. Justice Amin further questioned whether the high court ascertained the institution involved in call recordings. To this, the additional attorney general replied that it could not be ascertained so far and an investigation was underway. Justice Naeem remarked that it was unfortunate to witness that no one wanted to know the truth about the country. He went on to say that an inquiry commission was constituted to ascertain the truth but a stay order was issued by the top court. The jurist further observed that the top court has not yet fixed the hearing of the audio leaks' case, again. The parliament tried to know the truth but it was also stopped from pursuing the matter, he added. Justice Naeem questioned how the truth would come forth if the parliament and the court were stopped from doing their work. Justice Amin remarked that it could be possible that the individuals in the call recording were involved in leaking the audio conversation as every mobile phone has a recording system. He questioned whether the probe was carried out in this aspect. Later, the SC bench issued notices to the parties in the case besides suspending the high court's June 25 order and ordered the IHC to stop further proceedings. The hearing was adjourned for an indefinite period. It is pertinent to mention here that the alleged audio leak case involves a call conversation between former first lady and the ex-CJP’s son. The federal government had challenged the IHC order in the Supreme Court last month, as per The News report. The federal government, through Additional Attorney General Anis Muhammad Shahzad, filed an appeal under Article 185(3) of the Constitution against the order dated June 25, 2024, passed by an IHC single bench. It prayed to the apex court to grant leave to appeal against the impugned order dated 25-06-2024 by the IHC and set aside the said order. In its petition, the Centre made Najam — an Advocate High Court — as respondent besides making the federation of Pakistan through the Secretary, Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs Division, Speaker, National Assembly, Special Committee, appointed by Speaker, Assistant Director/Secretary Committee, at National Assembly Secretariat and others as Proforma respondents. The federal government submitted that an alleged audio conversation of Respondent No 1 with his friends regarding managing party ticket for contesting the election of the provincial assembly seat against certain monetary consideration became viral on social media along with the electronic media. Upon becoming the alleged audio leaks viral and discussion thereon in the National Assembly, the NA speaker took notice of the same and constituted a special committee vide circulation dated 02-05-2023 to audit, inquire and investigate the petitioner’s alleged audio leaks, it submitted."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) restrained an accountability court from issuing the final verdict in the £190 million settlement case on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan's plea. ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) restricted an accountability court from issuing the final verdict on the £190 million settlement case Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on his request.  The plea filed by the deposed prime minister, seeking the records for a past National Accountability Bureau (NAB) decision to close the graft case, was heard by a two-member divisional bench, comprising IHC's Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar, on Monday.  The incarcerated PTI chairman is accused of causing billions of rupees loss to the national exchequer in a case also involving a property tycoon. During the hearing, Khan's counsel Salman Safdar maintained that the proceedings in the reference against the former prime minister are still underway, and the last of the 35 witnesses are under cross-examination.  He apprised the court that there were eight accused, six of which are absconders and the two are Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. As per the allegations in the case, the petitioner of this plea, facilitated the settlement between the government and the property tycoon when he was the prime minister, the counsel added. Referring to the 190 million pounds received from UK's NCA in 2019, Safdar contended that NAB maintained in the case that the funds had to be transferred in the government's account but instead they were received in the Supreme Court's bank account and that the Al Qadir Trust is operational instead of a ghost project. At this, the bench inquired if the trust was registered. Safdar first replied in affirmative but later said he would inform the court after confirmation on the next hearing, upon being told that the trust wasn't registered according to the records available with the court. The lawyer also informed the court that they had filed a plea in the trial court for the provision of NAB's executive board meeting's record but the trial court turned it down. Moreover, he said that as per the Supreme Court's orders, accountability courts are restricted from issuing final verdicts. Justice Hassan warned the PTI counsel to refrain from using delaying tactics as it will withdraw the order staying the issuance of final verdict and direct the trial court to announce its decision at the earliest. Later, the IHC directed the trial court to stay the issuance final verdict for now and ordered NAB to submit its response to Khan's plea by Wednesday (August 21). It also stated that the trial of the case will continue in the meantime. Khan — along with his wife Bushra Bibi and other PTI leaders — are facing a NAB inquiry related to a settlement between the PTI government and the property tycoon, which reportedly caused a loss of £190 million to the national exchequer. As per the charges, Khan and other accused allegedly adjusted Rs50 billion — £190 million at the time — sent by Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government as part of the agreement with the property tycoon. They are also accused of getting undue benefit in the form of over 458 kanals of land at Mouza Bakrala, Sohawa, to establish Al Qadir University. During the PTI government, the NCA seized assets worth 190 million pounds from the property tycoon in Britain. The agency said the assets would be passed to the government of Pakistan and the settlement with the Pakistani property tycoon was “a civil matter, and does not represent a finding of guilt”. Subsequently, then-prime minister Khan got approval for the settlement with the UK crime agency from his cabinet on December 3, 2019, without disclosing the details of the confidential agreement. It was decided that the money would be submitted to the Supreme Court on behalf of the tycoon. Subsequently, the Al-Qadir Trust was established in Islamabad a few weeks after the PTI-led government approved the agreement with the property tycoon. Zulfi Bukhari, Babar Awan, Bushra Bibi, and her close friend Farah Khan were appointed as members of the trust. Two to three months after the cabinet’s approval, the property tycoon transferred 458 canals of land to Bukhari, a close aide of the PTI chief, which he later transferred to the trust. Later, Bukhari and Awan opted out as the trustees. That trust is now registered in the name of Khan, Bushra Bibi and Farah. NAB officials were earlier probing the alleged misuse of powers in the process of recovery of “dirty money” received from the UK crime agency. Following the emergence of \"irrefutable evidence\" in the case, the inquiry was converted into an investigation. According to the NAB officials, Khan and his wife obtained land worth billions of rupees from the property tycoon, to build an educational institute, in return for striking a deal to give legal cover to the property tycoon’s black money received from the UK crime agency."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, on Monday were sent on a 15-day judicial remand in a new Toshakhana reference. The development came during the hearing, conducted by Accountability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana, at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi which pertains to a new reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in July. The court has now ordered for the couple — who appeared before the judge after completing their 10-day physical remand on August 18 — to be produced on September 2. During the hearing of the case today, the accused submitted a written answer in the court in response to the questionnaire by NAB. The former prime minister and the ex-first lady were represented by their lawyers Zaheer Abbas Chaudhary and Salman Safdar. NAB Deputy Director Mohsen Haroon and Special Prosecutor Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi also appeared at the court to present their arguments. The previous hearing of the new reference was held on August 8. The new Toshakhana reference against the couple came to the fore after NAB arrested them hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted Khan and Bushra in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail. A team of the anti-corruption watchdog headed by Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon arrested the couple in the Adiala Jail in the new reference related to alleged \"misuse of power for acquiring Toshakhana gifts,\" the sources added. The NAB team rearrested Bushra Bibi after she was released from Adiala Jail’s Gate No. 3 to fulfil her legal obligations, the sources said adding the former first lady will remain incarcerated at the Rawalpindi prison. A NAB official had confirmed to The News in January that the top graft body was working on another reference against the cricketer-cum-politician which is also related to the Toshakhana gifts retained by him after payment of a paltry amount. Meanwhile, an accountability court's judge had earlier refused to extend Khan's physical remand in the case under question when the NAB filed a Toshakhana reference in December 2023. Following their arrest in the new Toshakhana case, both Imran and Bushra had moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC), stating that they been “illegally” remanded into NAB’s custody and that their arrest had affected the fundamental rights of “liberty and pre-arrest”. The legal woes of the deposed prime minister and his spouse refused to die down following the couple's arrest in the new reference related to state gifts. The IHC, on August 16, directed NAB's investigating officer to go to Adiala jail, seeking the couple's response to its questionnaire and adjourned the hearing till August 21. NAB should make it clear they have to defend the arrest of PTI founder, IHC's Justice Miangul Hassan said."

  "content": "KARACHI: On the controversy of \"record rains\" in Sukkur, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani on Monday acknowledged the difference between the figures of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the deputy commissioner. However, the provincial minister attributed the difference to the Sindh government's \"own way\" of measuring downpours in each taluka. Whereas, he added, the PMD had towers only in specific areas to measure rain. Ghani's comments came when he was addressing a press conference in the Sindh Assembly premises. Contrary to the Met Office report, Ghani backed the district administration’s claim, saying that 281 millimetre rain was recorded in Sukkur city. “Sukkur received five spells of torrential rains,” he said. An official statement issued by the provincial authorities said on Sunday that Sukkur recorded record-breaking 290mm of rainfall in just a single day. Sardar Sarfaraz, chief meteorologist at the PMD, on Monday rejected the claim regarding the record-breaking rainfall in Sukkur, terming it \"wrong\". \"116mm of rain was recorded in Sukkur in 48 hours. [While] Rohri, near Sukkur, recorded 134mm rainfall,\" he said, speaking with Geo News. Praising the Sukkur administration, the minister said most of the city’s part was cleared of rainwater, while work on drainage of water in some areas was still underway. Addressing the opposition’s criticism on accumulation of rainwater in Dadu, he said rain was still lashing the district and the arteries could not be cleared of water during rain. “Except for Allah (SWT), there’s no power on earth that can keep the land dry while rain is pouring,” he said. The minister also blamed loadshedding for the local administration’s failure to drain rainwater, saying the government had directed to end power outages. “Water can be drained with pumps, once there will be electricity,” he added.  Demanding permanent relief for citizens, the Sindh local bodies minister mocked the announcement about providing relief to people across Punjab for just two months, saying it was a political showoff. The minister's comment came in response to the Punjab government’s announcement of providing relief to the masses by slashing Rs14 per unit on electricity bills for two months — August and September. Ghani said it was the federal government’s responsibility to provide people cost-efficient electricity. \"Rs45 billion are being expended for relief of two months only, while scores of relief works could be done with that Rs45 billion. \"The question is what will happen after two months. The consumers will be paying the same [high] prices,\" the PPP leader remarked."

  "content": " Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Sher Afzal Khan Marwat has said that he has always condemned the acts of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who was recently detained by military over allegations of abuse of power and violating Army Act. \"Being a lawyer, I cannot approve of Gen Faiz's acts as spy chief such as victimising political opponents, harassing them, lodging cases against them..,\" he said while talking on Geo News' programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath' on Monday. Marwat said this in response to a question if he still holds the same opinion which he expressed in the same programme on February 15, stressing that he has the same opinion about the former spy chief. The PTI leader noted that Faiz's malpractices were blamed on the former ruling party. However, the PTI did not benefit from him, he asserted, adding that he [Faiz] had caused more harm to the PTI than any good to the party. Gen (retd) Faiz was taken into custody over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, the military's media wing had announced adding that a process of Field General Court Martial was also initiated against the retired general. A day later, three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest, according to the army’s media wing. Speaking about the terrorism, Marwat criticised the decision to bring back the TTP militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saying the decision caused instability in the province. The entire province is bearing the brunt of this policy as his native area is also grappling with militancy, he said. \"They [the TTP militants] should have been properly rehabilitated. Instead, they were left unattended. Now, they have taken up firearms,\" he said, adding that the KP people are facing the repercussions as 70% of the province is facing lawlessness. Responding to a query regarding the August 22 rally, the PTI leader said that the rally would take place as planned despite all government tactics to stop the party from staging the gathering. Responding to a query regarding the PTI's on the same programme, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that he believed that the party would not be allowed to hold this rally, given their record.  The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) activists staged a sit-in peacefully, he said, adding however, none of the PTI rallies have been peaceful. The religio-political party's protest remained within the limits of Rawalpindi as they were not allowed to enter the federal capital."

  "content": "   Three soldiers embraced martyrdom in a gun battle with terrorists who were trying to infiltrate Pakistan via Afghanistan border near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) district Bajaur, the Inter-Service Public Relation (ISPR) said on Monday.  A statement issued by the military's media wing said that the security forces noticed the movement of a group of terrorists trying to breach the Pak-Afghan border on the night between August 18 and 19.  \"Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. Resultantly, five khwarij of Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell, while four khwarij got injured,\" the ISPR said.  It said that the Pakistani soldiers fought gallantly and embraced martyrdom.  The soldiers, who embraced martyrdom were identified as Sepoy Waqar Khan, 25, Lance Naik Umer Hayat, 35, and Naik Inayat Khan, 36. The ISPR stated that Pakistan has been consistently asking the interim government in Afghanistan to ensure effective border management on their side of the border.  \"Interim Afghan government is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by khwarij for perpetuating acts of terrorism against Pakistan,\" it said, adding that the security forces of Pakistan remain committed to secure its borders and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve. On Friday, three terrorists were killed by the security forces during an intelligence-based operation in KP's area of Razmak, the ISPR said. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents were reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "    As the controversy over the \"record breaking rain\" in Sukkur deepens, Sindh government spokesperson and Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh has expressed disappointment with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), saying their data is based on what he called observations.  The Sukkur mayor said this in a video statement issued on Monday after Sardar Sarfaraz, the chief meteorologist at the PMD, rejected his claim regarding the record-breaking rainfall on Sunday in the city.  The mayor had claimed that Sukkur received 290mm rain in a single day which broke the \"77-year record\" of the city. The PMD's chief meteorologist, however, termed the claim \"wrong\" and told Geo News that \"116mm of rain was recorded in Sukkur in 48 hours. Rohri near Sukkur recorded 134mm rainfall.\"   \"I ask the meteorological department whether they have such a system in Sukkur that can accurately measure the rainfall in the city?\" Sheikh said today in response to the chief meteorologist.  He said that the PMD's data is unfortunately based on observation, no authentic system is installed in the city. \"If the PMD has any rain gauge system installed in the city, please share it with us,\" he added.  Sharing the PMD's weather forecast for Sukkur in the month of July, the Sindh government spox said that the department's forecast did not come true even for a single day.  He also shared the PMD's rain forecast for August, according to which the city was predicted to receive 53.5 mm. However, the rain situation in the current month is visible to everybody, he noted.  Sheikh said that here are five taluqas in district Sukkur and the provincial government had installed a rain gauge in each of the taluka where rainfall is measured every three hours.  This data is released to other departments including the CM Portal, he added. Meanwhile, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani also addressed the controversy earlier today, saying that the government has its own system in place to measure downpour in each taluka. However, he added, the PMD has towers in specific areas to measure rain. Ghani backed the district administration’s claim, saying that 281mm rain was recorded in Sukkur city. \"Sukkur received five spells of torrential rains,\" he said."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday accepted the federal government's appeal in a case related to audio leaks of Bushra Bibi, spouse of PTI founder Imran Khan and Najamul Saqib, son of former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar and ordered the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to stop proceedings till further orders. A two-member bench of the top court comprising Justice Amin-Ud-Din Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the Centre’s appeal against the IHC order in the audio leaks case today. At the outset of the hearing, Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman apprised the apex court that the relevant authorities had been stopped from phone tapping in an IHC order issued on May 29. He further said that the intelligence agencies were unable to perform counterintelligence due to the IHC's ruling which also restricted the agencies from arresting any terrorists. The government’s lawyer said that the high court had also stopped the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) from phone tapping and call data recording (CDR). He added that the high court exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution in contradiction to the top court's two verdicts.  It is worth mentioning that on May 29, IHC's Justice Babar Sattar had barred telecom companies from recording phone calls and data which disabled the intelligence and law enforcement agencies’ surveillance against criminals and terrorists. After the May 29 ruling, the IHC gave a subsequent verdict on the Islamabad police’s plea on June 25 in which the court allowed the telecom companies to share suspects’ data with the police for post-crime probe, however, it restricted the cellular firms from facilitating LEAs with surveillance. The two-member bench remarked that the apex court reviewed the IHC's May 29 order which was not extended in the fresh proceedings, therefore, the top court was not suspending the said ruling. Justice Amin further questioned whether the high court ascertained the institution involved in call recordings. To this, the additional attorney general replied that it could not be ascertained so far and an investigation was underway. Justice Naeem remarked that it was unfortunate to witness that no one wanted to know the truth about the country. He went on to say that an inquiry commission was constituted to ascertain the truth but a stay order was issued by the top court. The jurist further observed that the top court has not yet fixed the hearing of the audio leaks' case, again. The parliament tried to know the truth but it was also stopped from pursuing the matter, he added. Justice Naeem questioned how the truth would come forth if the parliament and the court were stopped from doing their work. Justice Amin remarked that it could be possible that the individuals in the call recording were involved in leaking the audio conversation as every mobile phone has a recording system. He questioned whether the probe was carried out in this aspect. Later, the SC bench issued notices to the parties in the case besides suspending the high court's June 25 order and ordered the IHC to stop further proceedings. The hearing was adjourned for an indefinite period. It is pertinent to mention here that the alleged audio leak case involves a call conversation between former first lady and the ex-CJP’s son. The federal government had challenged the IHC order in the Supreme Court last month, as per The News report. The federal government, through Additional Attorney General Anis Muhammad Shahzad, filed an appeal under Article 185(3) of the Constitution against the order dated June 25, 2024, passed by an IHC single bench. It prayed to the apex court to grant leave to appeal against the impugned order dated 25-06-2024 by the IHC and set aside the said order. In its petition, the Centre made Najam — an Advocate High Court — as respondent besides making the federation of Pakistan through the Secretary, Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs Division, Speaker, National Assembly, Special Committee, appointed by Speaker, Assistant Director/Secretary Committee, at National Assembly Secretariat and others as Proforma respondents. The federal government submitted that an alleged audio conversation of Respondent No 1 with his friends regarding managing party ticket for contesting the election of the provincial assembly seat against certain monetary consideration became viral on social media along with the electronic media. Upon becoming the alleged audio leaks viral and discussion thereon in the National Assembly, the NA speaker took notice of the same and constituted a special committee vide circulation dated 02-05-2023 to audit, inquire and investigate the petitioner’s alleged audio leaks, it submitted."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Approving a request by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) stopped the trial court from announcing the final verdict on the £190 million settlement  case. A two-member divisional bench, comprising IHC's Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar, on Monday, heard a plea filed by the deposed prime minister, seeking the records for a past National Accountability Bureau (NAB) decision to close the graft case.  The incarcerated PTI chairman is accused of causing billions of rupees loss to the national exchequer in a case also involving a property tycoon. During the hearing, Khan's counsel Salman Safdar maintained that the proceedings in the reference against the former prime minister are still underway, and the last of the 35 witnesses are under cross-examination.  He apprised the court that there were eight accused, six of which are absconders and the two are Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.  As per the allegations in the case, the petitioner of this plea, facilitated the settlement between the government and the property tycoon when he was the prime minister, the counsel added. Referring to the 190 million pounds received from UK's NCA in 2019,  Safdar contended that NAB maintained in the case that the funds had to be transferred in the government's account but instead they were received in the Supreme Court's bank account and that the Al Qadir Trust is operational instead of a ghost project. At this, the bench inquired if the trust was registered. Safdar first replied in affirmative but later said he would inform the court after confirmation on the next hearing, upon being told that the trust wasn't registered according to the records available with the court.  The lawyer also informed the court that they had filed a plea in the trial court for the provision of NAB's executive board meeting's record but the trial court turned it down. Moreover, he said that as per the Supreme Court's orders, accountability courts are restricted from issuing final verdicts.  Justice Hassan warned the PTI counsel to refrain from using delaying tactics as it will withdraw the order staying the final verdict and direct the trial court to announce its decision at the earliest. Later, the IHC directed the trial court to stay the final verdict for now and ordered NAB to submit its response to Khan's plea by Wednesday (August 21). It also stated that the trial of the case will continue in the meantime.  Khan — along with his wife Bushra Bibi and other PTI leaders — are facing a NAB inquiry related to a settlement between the PTI government and the property tycoon, which reportedly caused a loss of £190 million to the national exchequer. As per the charges, Khan and other accused allegedly adjusted Rs50 billion — £190 million at the time — sent by Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government as part of the agreement with the property tycoon. They are also accused of getting undue benefit in the form of over 458 kanals of land at Mouza Bakrala, Sohawa, to establish Al Qadir University. During the PTI government, the NCA seized assets worth 190 million pounds from the property tycoon in Britain. The agency said the assets would be passed to the government of Pakistan and the settlement with the Pakistani property tycoon was “a civil matter, and does not represent a finding of guilt”. Subsequently, then-prime minister Khan got approval for the settlement with the UK crime agency from his cabinet on December 3, 2019, without disclosing the details of the confidential agreement. It was decided that the money would be submitted to the Supreme Court on behalf of the tycoon. Subsequently, the Al-Qadir Trust was established in Islamabad a few weeks after the PTI-led government approved the agreement with the property tycoon. Zulfi Bukhari, Babar Awan, Bushra Bibi, and her close friend Farah Khan were appointed as members of the trust. Two to three months after the cabinet’s approval, the property tycoon transferred 458 canals of land to Bukhari, a close aide of the PTI chief, which he later transferred to the trust. Later, Bukhari and Awan opted out as the trustees. That trust is now registered in the name of Khan, Bushra Bibi and Farah. NAB officials were earlier probing the alleged misuse of powers in the process of recovery of “dirty money” received from the UK crime agency. Following the emergence of \"irrefutable evidence\" in the case, the inquiry was converted into an investigation. According to the NAB officials, Khan and his wife obtained land worth billions of rupees from the property tycoon, to build an educational institute, in return for striking a deal to give legal cover to the property tycoon’s black money received from the UK crime agency."

  "content": "  One case of the mpox virus has been detected in Pakistan of the clade 2 variety, the country's ministry of health said on Monday, adding that no cases of the clade 1b strain of the disease have been diagnosed. Clade 1b has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily though routine close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. \"As of now, there have been no reported cases of clade I in Pakistan,\" said Sajid Hussain Shah, spokesperson for the ministry of national health services. Following the detection of a mpox case in the country last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered effective screening at all airports, seaports, and borders, and asked border health services to maintain comprehensive surveillance. He also directed the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) to remain alert, conduct daily evaluations and ensure the availability of necessary equipment and kits for mpox assessment. The World Health Organisation declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. The WHO last week sounded its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in DR Congo since the current outbreak began in January 2023. Global health officials on last week confirmed an infection with the new strain of mpox in Sweden and linked it to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO did not urge any travel restrictions to curb the spread of mpox. The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, and children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications."

  "content": "   An accountability court on Monday sent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to jail on a 15-day judicial remand in a new Toshakhana reference. The hearing, held at the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, was conducted by Accountability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana. The judge has also ordered to produce both Imran and his wife before the court on September 2. The couple made their appearance today after the completion of their 10-day physical remand. The physical remand was approved by the court on August 8. During the hearing of the case, the accused submitted a written answer in the court in response to the questionnaire by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). The former prime minister and the ex-first lady were represented by their lawyers Zaheer Abbas Chaudhary and Salman Safdar. NAB Deputy Director Mohsen Haroon and Special Prosecutor Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi also appeared at the court to present their arguments. The previous hearing of the new reference was held on August 8. The new Toshakhana reference against the couple came to the fore after NAB arrested them hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted Khan and Bushra in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail. A team of the anti-corruption watchdog headed by Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon arrested the couple in the Adiala Jail in the new reference related to alleged \"misuse of power for acquiring Toshakhana gifts,\" the sources added. The NAB team rearrested Bushra Bibi after she was released from Adiala Jail’s Gate No. 3 to fulfil her legal obligations, the sources said adding the former first lady will remain incarcerated at the Rawalpindi prison. A NAB official had confirmed to The News in January that the top graft body was working on another reference against the cricketer-cum-politician which is also related to the Toshakhana gifts retained by him after payment of a paltry amount. Meanwhile, an accountability court's judge had earlier refused to extend Khan's physical remand in the case under question when the NAB filed a Toshakhana reference in December 2023. Following their arrest in the new Toshakhana case, both Imran and Bushra had moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC), stating that they been “illegally” remanded into NAB’s custody and that their arrest had affected the fundamental rights of “liberty and pre-arrest”. The legal woes of the deposed prime minister and his spouse refused to die down following the couple's arrest in the new reference related to state gifts. The IHC, on August 16, directed NAB's investigating officer to go to Adiala jail, seeking the couple's response to its questionnaire and adjourned the hearing till August 21. NAB should make it clear they have to defend the arrest of PTI founder, IHC's Justice Miangul Hassan said."

  "content": "KARACHI: Demanding permanent relief for citizens, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani on Monday mocked the announcement about providing relief to people across Punjab for just two months, saying it was a political showoff. The provincial minister's comment came in response to the Punjab government’s announcement of providing relief to the masses by slashing Rs14 per unit on electricity bills for two months — August and September. In a presser on August 16, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo Nawaz Sharif said the Punjab government had prepared a relief package by cutting the power tariff by Rs14 per unit for people consuming up to 500 units of electricity. \"The relief will be given in the bills of August and September,\" he had added. The move drew criticism from other provinces with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) decrying the 'use of provincial card' in electricity-related issues. It should be noted that the PML-N holds power in Punjab as well as in the Centre. Talking to journalists inside the Sindh Assembly premises, Ghani said it was the federal government’s responsibility to provide people cost-efficient electricity.  \"Rs45 billion are being expended for relief of two months only, while scores of relief works could be done with that Rs45 billion.  \"The question is what will happen after two months. The consumers will be paying the same [high] prices,\" the PPP leader remarked. Meanwhile, fearing a 'sense of despair' among the people of Sindh, Governor Kamran Tessori on Sunday had asked Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to announce a Punjab government-like relief in electricity bills. Governor Tessori had cited Punjab government's example and asked CM Murad to allocate funds from the provincial budget for relief to the people. \"Sindh CM [Murad Ali Shah], like Punjab, should provide a relief of Rs14 per unit in electricity bills,\" he had said, saying that its denial may lead to a sense of despair among the people. Addressing the controversy of \"record rains\" in Sukkur, Ghani admitted that the figures of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and deputy commissioner were different. He said it was because the Sindh government had its own way of measuring downpour in each taluka. Whereas, he said, the PMD had towers only in specific areas to measure rain. Contrary to the Met Office report, he backed the district administration’s claim, saying that 281 millimetre rain was recorded in Sukkur city. “Sukkur received five spells of torrential rains,” he said. An official statement issued by the provincial authorities said on Sunday that Sukkur recorded record-breaking 290mm of rainfall in just a single day. Sardar Sarfaraz, chief meteorologist at the PMD, on Monday rejected the claim regarding the record-breaking rainfall in Sukkur, terming it \"wrong\". \"116mm of rain was recorded in Sukkur in 48 hours. Rohri near Sukkur recorded 134mm rainfall,\" he said, speaking with Geo News. Praising the administration, the minister said most of the city’s part was cleared of rainwater, while work on drainage of water in some areas was still underway. "

  "description": "At least 28 Pakistani pilgrims died and another 23 were injured in a bus accident in Iran’s Yazd city, Pakistan’s envoy to Tehran said on Wednesday. “In pursuit of their religious journey, 28 Pakistani zaireen laid down their lives last night in Yazd city in bus accident. Another 23 are injured,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu said in a post on X. “I have no words to express grief but I can assure [you] that I will do my very best for repatriation of those who passed away […] and look after the injured ones,” Tipu added.     According to Tipu, embassy officials had already left in the morning for Yazd, which he said was almost 700 kilometres away from Pakistan’s embassy in Tehran. “An officer in Zahedan is overseeing emergency arrangements,” the ambassador said, adding he was in contact with the Iranian government and the office of Yazd’s mayor for “crucial arrangements”. “We thank Iran for extending excellent cooperation. We kindly request your support and patience in this hour of grief,” Tipu said. Meanwhile, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also confirmed the deaths of 28 Pakistanis in the accident, saying he was “extremely dejected to hear about the sad news”.     “I extend my heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Pakistan especially those families who lost loved ones. I wish for the safe and speedy recovery of the injured,” Moghadam said in a post on X. He said he was in “constant contact with the relevant authorities in Iran” and had “insisted for the speedy supply of the necessary services to the injured, including healthcare” as well as the return of the bodies to Pakistan. Pakistan’s Embassy in Iran also shared contact details of relevant officials who could be approached for further information about the accident:  Ahmad Shami: +92 3134556593 (WhatsApp) Aftab Butt: +92 3004166896 Siddique: +98 9046145412          Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan reported that at least 35 Pakistani pilgrims died and another 15 were injured after a bus overturned at a checkpost in Yazd. Quoting initial reports, Radio Pakistan said that the accident occurred due to the failure of brakes. The injured were taken to hospitals in Yazd, the report said, adding that most of the passengers belonged to Larkana, Ghotki and other cities of Sindh. Condolences Expressing his grief over the accident, President Asif Ali Zardari directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to repatriate the dead and provide timely aid to the injured. “The President expressed his regret over the loss of precious lives,” said a statement issued by his party, the PPP, on social media platform X. He further prayed for the deceased.         Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on X he was “deeply saddened by the loss of lives”. Praying for the bereaved families and for the speedy recovery of the injured, PM Shehbaz said he has directed Pakistan’s Mission in Tehran to extend all possible assistance to the affected families.     Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was gravely concerned for the welfare of those injured in the accident, and expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.         “I have given instructions to our Ambassador in Tehran to ascertain exact situation and provide swift medical relief and recovery services as well as arrange repatriation of dead bodies to Pakistan,” he said in a statement on X. “Our embassy is in constant touch with authorities in Yazd city. We thank the Iranian Government for their assistance and help.” Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister of Sindh, from where most of the pilgrims reportedly hailed, expressed regret over the loss of life in the accident, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson. The Sindh CM directed provincial minister Nasir Shah to facilitate the affected families in Iran, and to also contact the Iran Consul General in Karachi. CM Murad further instructed Shah to get in touch with the foreign ministry to repatriate the bodies as soon as possible. “Travel facilities should be arranged for the pilgrims’ return,” the CM was quoted as saying. He also directed that the best medical facilities be provided to the injured. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also expressed her condolences to the families of the victims and injured. “May they find strength in this difficult time of bereavement,” she said in a statement on X.

  "description": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday launched the provincial government’s Apna Chhat Apna Ghar (our roof, our house) housing scheme, less than a week after her government announced plans for an electricity subsidy in Punjab that has roiled coalition allies. During a ceremony, the chief minister said that owners of 1-5 marlas of land in urban areas and 1-10 marlas in rural areas would receive interest-free loans of up to Rs1.5m from the Punjab Government to build houses. “For the first three months, landowners will not pay one paisa,” the chief minister said. “There’s no place like home,” CM Maryam said. “Those who have their own home, their own roof, they don’t understand what it is like to be homeless.” On Friday, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif announced a Rs14-per-unit reduction on consumer bills for consumers who use between 200 and 500 units per month for August and September. The move, limited to Punjab, led to discontent from the PPP-led Sindh government, an ally of the PML-N government in the Centre. The chief minister outlined the structure of the loan, which would be paid back over a period of seven years. “There is no need to pay for the first three months,” the CM said, adding, “Those who take the loans will have to pay a maximum monthly instalment of Rs14,000. “I have kept the instalments at Rs14,000 because people need to establish a monthly budget, pay children’s fees and utility bills and buy food and medicine,” she said. CM Maryam also referred to the reduced electricity bills for consumers using between 200 and 500 units per month for the months of August and September, reiterating her administration’s commitment to extending relief to Punjab’s people. She added that there are no hidden charges or costs in this scheme. “This is why we didn’t involve banks,” Maryam explained. “We wanted to avoid hidden costs.” Outlining how interested parties can apply for the scheme, the chief minister said, “You can fill out an online application on the PITB online portal. For the less IT-savvy, we have given a number: 080009100. “Call and you will receive information on the scheme from your local DC office,” she said, adding that she intends to implement this system in all major cities of Punjab. The chief minister described the houses that are being constructed, stating that each house in the scheme will feature two bedrooms, a TV lounge, a bathroom and a kitchen “of a decent size”. “Even the poor have self-respect, we need to get this right because you only build a house once,” she stated. The chief minister added that her government will expand this scheme across Punjab within five years so that those who need houses “are able to get them”. "

  "description": "• Punjab-only relief package draws flak from Sindh, KP • Murad says ‘N’ spending money ‘to rectify past mistakes’ • PM asserts move solely funded by Punjab’s own budget • Leghari says ‘good news’ on IPPs in a month or two ISLAMABAD: The issue of soaring electricity tariffs and the Punjab-only power subsidy have ignited a war of words between the ruling coalition parties, with the PPP criticising the PML-N-led federal and Punjab governments. The opposition has also seized the opportunity to criticise the PML-N, accusing the party of providing relief only to Punjab while neglecting other provinces. The political friction escalated on Friday when PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, alongside his daughter and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, announced a Rs14 per unit relief for those electricity consumers in Punjab who use between 200 and 500 units per month. Mr Sharif claimed that the relief was funded by a Rs45 billion cut in Punjab’s development budget. This announcement was met with disdain from the PPP-led Sindh government and the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Both provinces, apparently lacking the resources to offer similar relief, started criticising the federal and Punjab governments. PM to the rescue Following criticism from Sindh and KP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came to rescue the Punjab government on Tuesday, claiming that the Centre had not provided a single penny to the provincial government and that the relief package was solely funded by Punjab’s own budget. During a federal cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the prime minister urged other provinces to follow Punjab’s example by reallocating their development funds to provide similar relief to electricity consumers. “Instead of politicking, the provincial governments should follow Punjab’s course of action to provide relief to their electricity consumers by utilising funds from the trillions of rupees transferred to them under the National Finance Commission,” the prime minister stated. “This is the right of the people. The federal government has zero contribution to this relief package. Other provinces should also do the same. If the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government wants to give such relief to the people, we will be happy. But politicking should be avoided and facts should not be distorted,” he said. He dismissed accusations of federal discrimination, emphasising that nearly 60 per cent of NFC funds go to the provinces. The federal government, he said, had to face immense challenges in the form of payments of loans and interests on foreign-funded projects that benefited the entire country. PM Shehbaz highlighted that the federal government has allocated Rs50 billion to provide a three-month relief to domestic consumers using up to 200 units of electricity, which constituted around 86pc of domestic power users. He also mentioned a partnership with the Balochistan government to solarise 28,000 tube wells, a project costing Rs70 billion, with the federal government bearing Rs55 billion. The premier stressed that the federal government, in consultation with the provincial governments, was working on long-term measures to stabilise the economy and boost the country’s trade and exports. He said the federal government would take all such measures after taking the IMF on board, unlike the PTI’s “irrational” step of violating an agreement with the lender and pushing the country to the brink of default. Murad blames PML-N’s ‘past mistakes’ Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah criticised the  PML-N, blaming the party for introducing costly power plants decades ago, which, he argued, have led to the current high electricity costs. He said Sindh would now focus on developing its own coal and solar power plants, for which the province had been barred. Mr Shah further accused the federal government of neglecting Sindh, claiming that many projects requiring federal financial assistance remain stalled. Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon also weighed in, questioning the long-term effectiveness of Punjab’s two-month relief to power consumers and advocating for sustainable, long-term policies to benefit the entire country. In an apparent retort, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz called on the Sindh government to alleviate the suffering of its people, questioning why providing relief to the public was being criticised. “Is it nonsense to provide relief to the masses?” she wondered. Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari also joined the fray, asserting that Maryam Nawaz would have provided relief to the people of Sindh “if she was CM of that province”. Barrister Saif, the spokesperson for the PTI-led KP government, said providing relief to only one province will pave the way for a sense of deprivation among other provinces. Adding to the tension, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman announced a countrywide shutter-down strike on Aug 28 against inflated electricity bills. “The Jamaat will launch a new movement in the country on the issue,” he said. ‘Good news’ on IPPs Minister for Energy Awais Leghari on Tuesday admitted that electricity costs in Pakistan were the highest in the entire region but stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will announce “good news” about the issue of independent power producers (IPPs) in a month or two. Speaking at the National Youth Convention in Islamabad, Mr Leghari said the government was planning to establish new power plants to address the issue of power load-shedding in the country. He stressed that despite expensive power generation, electricity was being provided to the consumers at subsidised rates. He also admitted that due to the high cost of electricity, industries were shutting down, but the government was now providing electricity to the industries at lower rates, bearing the additional costs. “Within a month or two Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will share good news to the public and industries,” he said. “Everyone will be benefited from it.” Published in Dawn, August 21st, 2024 "

  "description": "GILGIT: Two Russian climbers were rescued from Gasherbrum IV on Tuesday after remaining stranded at an altitude of 6,400 metres for over three days. A five-member rescue team successfully managed to bring down the climbers to the advance base camp at a height of 6,000m on Tuesday. The Army Aviation helicopters are expected to airlift the climbers to Skardu today (Wednesday). According to the tour operator of the Russian climbers, the two mountaineers suffered injuries in their legs and arms and probably fractures. How­ever, they are out of danger now. The climbers Mikhail Mironov and Sergei Miro­nov were part of a five-member team attempting to ascend the mountain when they were hit by a snow avalanche at 6,400m altitude on Saturday. The two climbers got stranded after being injured, while two others, Alexy Bautin and Evgeni Lablokov, remained unhurt and were later rescued by the army and airlifted to Skardu on Sunday. One of their partners, Sergei Nilov, who went missing, has lost his life, the rescued climbers told Dawn on Tuesday. The five climbers had set out on a mission to retrieve the body of their countryman, Dmitry Golovchenko, who went missing on the mountain in 2023. Rescue mission On Sunday, the Army Aviation helicopters dropped the five-men rescue team — four local climbers Yousuf Ali, Muhammad Ali, Ghulam Abbas, Muhammad Younus and Mr Lablokov — at a height of 6,000m as helicopters can’t land and hover above that altitude. The rescue team started their climb to approach the stranded climbers at 6,4000m in the early hours of Monday. Despite bad weather, snowfall and wind, the rescuers successfully approached the climbers and provided them with food and other necessities. They were then brought down to 6,000m, where a tent and other facilities had been made available for climbers. The Army Aviation helicopters were set to fly from Skardu to airlift the climbers from the advance base camp on Tuesday but couldn’t do so due to the bad weather.

  "description": "D.I. KHAN: The negotiations between the PTI and the JUI-F to form a political alliance seem to have broken down, as JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Tuesday he would not become part of any alliance in light of his previous experiences. In an interaction with journalists and intelligentsia at his residence, Maulana Fazl said the JUI-F would take a solo flight against the government, but its cooperation with opposition parties on issues of mutual concern would continue. The Maulana, who headed the Pakistan Democratic Movement against the PTI government, said he would spearhead the movement against the incumbent government alone while continuing to cooperate with opposition parties on common issues.  Speaking about talks with the PTI, the JUI-F chief said his party had “deep ideological differences” with the PTI and still held that belief. However, his position on some issues was the same as the PTI’s.  Maulana says talks with other opposition parties, including PTI, will continue  Replying to a query about Imran Khan being a ‘foreign agent’, Maulana Fazl said he still had the same view on that matter, adding that he was not making a political alliance with any party, including the PTI. “I called him a foreign agent because of proof I had and his affiliation with Zac Goldsmith, but if I am talking with PTI leaders, it is about rigging in elections and not about changing my views,” he said while trying to justify the talks.  Maulana Fazl said that instead of a comprehensive political alliance with the PTI, issue-based talks with the opposition party were still ongoing. It may be noted that the JUI-F leader had recently clarified his ‘Jewish agent’ moniker for Imran Khan, saying it was not a “cuss but a title”. He said that secular parties were trying to establish liberal democracy in the country while the religious parties were trying to establish an Islamic system in Pakistan, but in his opinion, the protection of the Constitution, fair elections, and national security was a common problem and all political parties should be united on these issues. According to the Maulana, friendship and enmity are not permanent in politics, but in democratic societies, this diverse process becomes the platform for intellectual and political evolution. Speaking about his meeting with Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leader Manzoor Pashteen, the JUI-F leader said he had advised the rights activist not to just listen to him but also consult other political leaders, such as ANP’s Asfandyar Wali and Jamaat-i-Islami leader Sirajul Haq. Maulana Fazl said national security was the top priority and he met Manzoor Pashteen to find a balance and bring moderation to all political forces and the oppressed regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. “We will promote…the narrative of the struggle for the rights by staying within the country’s geography and abiding by the Constitution,” he added. The Maulana said he did not have personal enmity with anyone, including the PML-N and PPP, but disagreed with these parties on policies. “Instead of trying to convince me by promises, convince us with policies and practical steps,” he added. He also confirmed there was no suggestion regarding an alliance of religious parties. Published in Dawn, August 21st, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court, in a written order on audio leaks case, has regretted that a three-man inquiry commission formed to probe the veracity of audio leaks was never fixed for hearing after its last hearing on May 27, 2023. A two-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, which was seized  with the government’s appeal against the June 25 order of the Islamabad  High Court on the petitions filed by Bushra Bibi and Najamus Saqib, the  son of former Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, issued a five-page order after Monday’s hearing. The order recalled that the Justice Isa-led inquiry commission appointed by the government had started its proceedings on May 22, but the SC stayed its proceedings on May 26. The commission then postponed its further proceedings until the petitions against its formation are decided. Appointed under Section 3 of the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017, the inquiry commission on audio leaks also comprised the then Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.  Govt-appointed body stopped working till decision on petitions against its formation  The commission was to inquire into the veracity of the audio leaks allegedly concerning the judiciary, conversations of former Punjab CM Chaudhry Parvez Elahi with lawyers regarding a former SC judge and fixation of some cases before a particular bench, with Justice Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, between ex-CJP Saqib Nisar and a senior lawyer Khawaja Tariq Rahim on the outcome of a case (Imran Khan’s May 9 arrest from the premises of Islamabad High Court) before a particular bench of the Supreme Court, between the former premier and his party colleague about their links in the SC, between mother-in-law of the ex-CJP and a lawyer’s wife on cases before the SC and hoping for unconstitutional rule, between son of ex-CJP and his friend Abuzar mentioning his father in a political role etc. The five-page order recalled how Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman argued that the jurisdiction exercised by the high court was beyond the scope of Article 199 of the Constitution and to substantiate relied upon previous SC judgments like 2023 Messrs Sadiq Poultry (Pvt) Ltd and 2018 Jahanzaib Malik to establish that the powers used by the high court were suo motu which cannot be exercised by the high court in the light of judgements. The AAG contented that the five questions framed on May 31, 2023 by the high court were not on the basis of the pleadings of any of the parties but the court on its own framed the questions which were against the mandate of Article 199 of the Constitution. He argued that the high court had no jurisdiction while hearing a matter under Article 199 to go into a comprehensive inquiry which required fact finding and further it was a matter of investigation. The AAG reminded the basic challenge before the high court was regarding the proceedings initiated by the committee constituted by then NA speaker, but the proceedings lapsed when the then national assembly was dissolved on Aug 9, 2023. Thereafter, there was no need to further proceed with the petition filed by Mian Najamus Saqib. The order said even the high court did not bother to appreciate the stance of Bushra Bibi that she had pleaded with regard to audio leaks in her petition by contending that the audio leaks had been fabricated, tempered with by trimming, cannibalizing and piecing together distinct parts of the conversations to convey incorrect and inaccurate massaging. “The (high) court was bound to first see and check the veracity of this fact and thereafter proceed with the matter,” the five-page SC order said. Consequently, the apex court grant leave to consider the points highlighted and issued noticed to the respondents with a direction that the high court order would remain suspended and further proceedings would remain stayed.When the AAG urged the SC to suspend the May 29, 2024 interim order of the high court, the SC noted that the order was not extended by the high court in its next hearing on June 25, therefore there was no ground for its suspension.

  "description": "AMID an impression that former chief justice Saqib Nisar will be held accountable over his alleged links with the events of May 9, the former CJP on Tuesday said that he would return to Pakistan next month and was ready to face the “propaganda” being unleashed against him. Reporting on her conversation with the former chief justice, Aaj News anchorperson Munizae Jahangir quoted the ex-CJP as saying that he would return to Pakistan on September 6 or 7. The former top judge also played down his relationship with incarcerated ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed, saying the latter was “very respectable” towards him and they enjoyed cordial ties. In response to a question about any meetings with Gen Faiz following his retirement from the judiciary, the ex-CJP said he had visited the former general in 2022 when he was in Swat for vacations and Gen Faiz, who was the Peshawar corps commander at the time, invited him to Peshawar for lunch along with his family. The ex-CJP lamented that he was being subjected to a “media trial” and if there were any allegations against him, he should be charge-sheeted so he could contest them. A day earlier, The News had quoted the former chief justice as saying he had nothing to do with Gen Hameed, PTI or the May 9 violence. Published in Dawn, August 21st, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: A 23-month-old girl in Balochistan’s Kharan district was diagnosed with poliovirus a day after her death, taking the tally of this year’s cases to 15, a health official has confirmed. Balochistan remains an epicentre of the disease, with 12 cases reported from eight districts — Dera Bugti, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Quetta, Jhal Magsi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah and now Kharan. The victim, a resident of Union Council South City-A in Kharan tehsil, died on August 19 at a hospital in Quetta, an official of the National Institute of Health (NIH) said. He added that as per the parents, the child developed a high-grade fever, along with paralysis of both lower limbs and neck muscles, on July 31. The family treated the child at home for five days and then took her to a local informal healthcare provider on Aug 4. Three days later, on Aug 7, the child was taken to a private hospital where she was notified as a suspected case of poliovirus. The case was investigated on the same day, and a sample was sent to the NIH. The patient had no history of intramuscular injection — usually a shot in the arm — in the last 24 hours prior to the onset of paralysis. No travel history of the child has been reported pri­or to the onset of the virus. The child passed away on August 19, 2024, he said. Published in Dawn, August 21st, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has imposed a fine on the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIA) for filing frivolous applications seeking review of an earlier order. Comprising Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar and Justice Agha Faisal, the two-judge bench dismissed the review applications with costs of Rs25,000 each for being frivolous and devoid of merit, and directed the petitioner/applicant to deposit the same in the account of the SHC clinic. The PIA had filed petitions in 2022, assailing respective interlocutory orders rendered by the National Industrial Relat­i­ons Commission (NIRC) and the SHC had dismissed the same in November 2022. Thereafter, the bench noted that the petitioner preferred review applications ostensibly beyond the pale of limitation in January 2023. The dismissal of the petitions was inter alia predicated upon the observation that since the governing law, Industrial Relations Act (IRA) 2012, contained no provision of appeal in respect of interlocutory orders, thus the same could not be construed to automatically become assailable in writ jurisdiction, it added. The lawyer for the applicant argued that Section 58(2) of IRA did contain a provision to assail interlocutory orders and upon being requested to identify the relevant constituent in the provision, he submitted that a copy of the statute was not available therewith.  The bench then read out the relevant provision/statute to the lawyer, but he remained unable to identify any constituent therein to corroborate his argument. It was further articulated that the absence of any provision for a statutory appeal provided entitlement to prefer a writ petition while such an argument was prima facie in conflict with his earlier submission, however, once again the counsel remained unable to substantiate his averment with any law, it added. The bench also observed that the jurisdiction of the SHC in review proceedings was limited and the entire thrust of the arguments advanced by the counsel was directed towards merits of an already dismissed case and there was absolutely no effort to identify any mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or any other sufficient reason justifying a review of the order. “It is thus the considered view of this Court that these applications are frivolous, devoid of merit, hence, were dismissed, with costs of Rs25,000 each to be deposited in the account of the Sindh High Court Clinic,” it concluded.

  "description": "The Lahore police registered a case on Tuesday after the staff of the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) and the Young Doctors Association (YDA) alleged that a five-year-old girl was raped on the facility’s premises. The protest was led by Punjab YDA President Dr Shoaib Niazi and Dr Azam Saeed, president of the YDA’s chapter for the hospital. The demonstration was also joined by the staff and students of the hospital as well as the Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU). A note of demands by the protesters said: “An incident of rape/attempt of rape on the premises of SGRH Lahore has occurred, which was pushed under the carpet by the administration. The victim was said to be a minor of five years old. “The students of FJMU/SGRH demand transparency and an investigation of the case. The students further demand the administration to answer their criminal silence. If such incidents are covered up and silenced, it raises a question mark for the hospital administration!” Among others, the protesters demanded that a first information report (FIR) be lodged and there should be transparency about any further steps taken regarding the case. Meanwhile, Dr Hafiz Moinuddin, the hospital’s medical superintendent, told Dawn.com that the girl was sleeping with her mother in a corridor when a sanitary worker “touched” her at 2am in the night. He said the girl screamed and woke her mother up, prompting several people in the hospital to gather on the spot. The sanitary worker was then nabbed and taken to the security room where the security in-charge called the police and handed over the suspect to them. Dr Moinuddin said the sanitary worker was not a hospital employee and the company responsible for hiring him had also fired him from his job following the incident. He said the hospital administration was taking special measures for the security of the attendants of patients and would not tolerate any mismanagement. The FIR was registered at the Civil Line police station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Saleem Raza under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 509ii (insulting modesty or causing sexual harassment) and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or for a shorter term) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Sections 376 and 511 were added later to the FIR. Notably, the text of the FIR did not mention rape. The FIR said the police received a call that a suspect had harassed a woman’s daughter on the hospital’s third floor and upon arriving, the police were informed that the suspect was a sweeper at the hospital who was surrounded by a crowd after the girl had created noise. Videos of protesters on social media showed them criticising the FIR, alleging that it downplayed the incident and criticising officials for covering up the matter in an attempt to silence the victim’s family.

  "description": "The Karachi police on Tuesday said it had booked a woman, who was involved in a deadly accident on Karsaz Road a day ago, over murder charges. On Monday evening, a speeding SUV killed two people, including a woman, and injured three others. Traffic Police Deputy Inspector General Ahmad Nawaz Cheema had told Dawn that a woman was driving a Toyota car in an “extremely negligent manner”. According to Cheema, the car hit a motorcycle apparently while negotiating a turn from Tipu Sultan Road towards the service road of Muslim League House. The vehicle then hit two more motorcycles and overturned after colliding with a car parked on the road.      Five people were injured in the accident, with two of them succumbing to their injuries after being taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for treatment. In a statement issued today, the District East police’s spokesperson confirmed that the police had registered a first information report (FIR) against the suspect. The statement further said that the driver was arrested last night and handed over to the police’s investigation wing. “The woman’s medical [examination] had been conducted, but the report has not been submitted by the hospital, as per the latest information,” the police said. It added that the investigation wing was conducting a probe and that further information could be sought from the office of the District East’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) of investigation. Police granted one-day custody Meanwhile, a Karachi East court granted the police one-day custody of the suspect and ordered it to produce her before the court tomorrow. According to the court’s order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, investigation officer (IO) Rehan Ahmed failed to produce the suspect before the special duty judicial magistrate. Ahmed informed the court that the suspect had been admitted to JPMC’s psychiatry department for treatment and was “not in a position to bring to the court”. He also produced a medical certificate —  issued by Dr Ghooni Lal, Associate Professor and head of the JPMC’s Department of Psychiatry — before the court that stated the same, the order noted. The court noted that the available case record satisfied the court that the suspect’s physical custody was “very much necessary” for remand under section 167 (a procedure when investigation cannot be completed in 24 hours) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). “Prima facie appears that [the] accused [is] not in a position to be brought before the court at once without personal suffering, and risk to health,” the order read, adding that “custody is hereby sanctioned to investigation officer for 01 day”. “During the sanctioned period, the said investigation officer is liable to make arrangements for keeping the accused person in safe custody,” it observed. The judge directed IO Ahmed to produce the suspect in court tomorrow (Wednesday) “if she sufficiently recovers and is able to be produced”. “However, in case she doesn’t sufficiently recovers [sic], [the] investigation officer may apply afresh to the concerned court for further orders,” the order stated. The FIR The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed at 11pm last night at the Bahadurabad police station on the complaint of Imtiaz Arif, whose brother and niece died in the accident. The FIR invoked sections 320 (punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving), 337-G (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent driving), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the complaint, Arif was informed at around 6:45pm on Monday that his brother Imran Arif, who was riding a motorcycle along with his daughter Amna Arif, was met with an accident. Upon reaching the JPMC, the complainant found out that the suspect, who was driving a Toyota Land Cruiser, had hit his brother’s motorcycle from behind. “Abdussalam, son of Mohammad Ishaq, who was riding on the motorcycle was also injured,” the FIR stated, adding that Imran and his daughter got several injuries and passed away later. No one above the law: police Separately, in a statement, the investigation SSP’s spokesperson rebutted reports “circulating on social media that were trying to give an impression that the police were perhaps slow in taking action as per routine”. The SSP’s spokesperson highlighted that the police had arrested the suspect and filed an FIR against her. The statement further said: “Suspecting the woman driver of being intoxicated, the police as per procedure, sent the woman to a hospital for a medical [examination].” It added that the JPMC had the authority to give the medical report and had been written to over the matter. The spokesperson noted that an arrested person had to be produced before a court within 24 hours of arrest, for which the investigation wing was making efforts. “The District East police want to clarify that no one is above the law. From the incident to the current time, the law has been strictly followed without any hesitation,” the statement asserted. It further said that the police’s investigation wing would produce a charge sheet before a court on merit as the case proceeds. “Yesterday, two valuable lives were lost and the police will not commit any negligence in its investigation,” the SSP’s spokesperson said.

  "description": "A young woman lost her life on Tuesday when her scooter slipped on Karachi’s uneven Rashid Minhas Road near Jauhar Mor, resulting in a collision with a dump truck due to poor road conditions. Deputy Inspector General-Traffic (DIG) Ahmad Nawaz Cheema told Dawn.com that 23-year-old Sara Iqbal was travelling from the Nipa Bridge towards Drigh Road when her scooter slipped on the uneven street near Sunny Pride Apartments on Rashid Minhas Road in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. “A dump truck (TKM-214) coming from behind ran over her, and she died on the spot,” Cheema told Dawn.com. He said the driver fled the scene, leaving the vehicle behind, which was subsequently handed over to Sharea Faisal police for investigation. Cheema added that Rashid Minhas Road and several roads had developed potholes across the metropolis due to rain. “The dilapidated road infrastructure after rains is not only hampering smooth flow traffic but also causing road accidents,” observed the traffic police head. He added that the traffic police were filling holes/ditches created on the roads everywhere. “We are trying to make roads motor-able after rains on our own,” DIG Cheema said. The dangers of deteriorating road conditions were highlighted in a medical conference in November 2023, which revealed that around 500 people, mostly motorcyclists, suffer injuries in road traffic accidents in Karachi daily and are brought to emergency units for treatment.

  "description": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday discharged Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, in 12 cases related to the May 9 violence that followed her husband’s arrest last year. Countrywide protests erupted on May 9 last year after the paramilitary Rangers whisked away Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a corruption case. While the protests were underway, social media was flooded with footage of rioting and vandalism at various spots, including the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence and General Headquarters, the army’s head of office in Rawalpindi. Last week, the ATC rejected petitions seeking post-arrest bail for Bushra, asking the police to complete the probe within seven days regarding the cases. Meanwhile, IHC Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb had referred to the IHC chief justice a petition seeking details of the cases against her. While hearing the case against the former first lady today, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Malik Ejaz Asif discharged her in 12 cases related to the May 9 riots. While speaking to the media outside Adiala jail, Bushra’s lawyer Salman Safdar said that the Rawalpindi police had requested the courts for a physical remand, however, the court rejected the request. Safdar said that the decision made by the court today was likely to affect the cases of the PTI founder. "

  "description": "THERE have been few instances in Pakistan’s history where an army chief has bowed out without generating controversy. This might not be surprising in a country where the military has for the most part been deeply involved in political power games. Retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa may have been among the most controversial army chiefs, but whatever is happening now is no less scandalous. Gen Bajwa has been held responsible by both sides of the political divide for the fall of their respective governments. Both accuse him of deceit. While he retired almost two years ago after serving two terms as army chief, the controversy surrounding his contentious tenure refuses to die down. The recent arrest of his protégé and former ISI chief, retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed, who is now facing field court martial, has put Gen Bajwa back in the spotlight. New revelations have emerged about his alleged political manoeuvring that saw the fall of two prime ministers and regime change. While former prime minister Nawaz Sharif accused him and his now disgraced ISI chief of plotting his removal from office in 2017 and his subsequent conviction in a litany of criminal cases, his nemesis Imran Khan, too, blames the general for his government’s downfall. Interestingly, it was Gen Bajwa who has been credited for installing the former cricket captain in power through an engineered election in 2018. He was also seen as the architect of the hybrid dispensation that propped up the fledgling political set-up before the Khan-Bajwa partnership fell apart, clearing the way for the return of the PML-N-led government. A dejected Khan shouted betrayal as the establishment pulled the rug from under his feet.  New revelations have emerged about the retired army chief’s alleged political manoeuvres.  In a series of interviews on private TV channels, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has made some startling revelations about the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring that led to changing political alliances. It was not merely the declaration of neutrality by the military leadership that led to the collapse of the three-and-a-half-year-long hybrid arrangement; in fact, there was active engagement between the then opposition and the establishment, as revealed by Khawaja Asif, that changed the game. But most interesting is the story of how Gen Bajwa was chosen for the coveted post by the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, despite being much lower on the seniority list. It was on the assurance of retired Maj-Gen Ijaz Amjad, his father-in-law, that Gen Bajwa was appointed. It was apparent that merit and seniority did not matter in the appointment of the army chief. Sharif was already embroiled in the Panama case and his ties with the then military leadership had soured. He needed a trusted person in a critical position. Gen Bajwa was indeed a political choice. But as a retired general said, once in this powerful position, an army chief is not expected to be loyal to anyone but his own institution. And that is exactly what happened. Some months later, Sharif was ousted via the Supreme Court. There was little doubt that the action against the three-time prime minister had the full backing of the security establishment. I remember a press briefing by Gen Bajwa months after his taking charge. The apex court was expected to deliver its ruling on the Sharif case and it seemed certain that he would be convicted. A journalist asked the general what he thought would happen if the prime minister was removed. “Nothing will happen,” he responded curtly. “Nothing happened even when we hanged Bhutto.” One could see the arrogance of power. It didn’t take much time for the new incumbent to show that he was in charge. Gen Bajwa was fond of holding forth for hours on end on national and international issues, though he had no clear understating of any of the complex challenges the country faced. Then came the 2018 elections. The security institution had already decided that Nawaz Sharif would not be allowed to return to power. Gen Bajwa later told me that it was the view of the institution that Imran Khan should be supported. A new hybrid system came into being after the 2018 elections with the formation of the PTI government that had the total backing of the security establishment. But there were some inherent contradictions in the system that started emerging, with the new prime minister trying to assert his position and taking some decisions which came into conflict with the establishment’s views. A long meeting with Gen Bajwa in October 2021 gave me some insight into the widening cleavage between the establishment and the PTI government. The change in the ISI command had certainly widened the trust gap though there was no sign of a complete rupture then. He told me that the prime minister had become completely dependent on Faiz Hameed. But it was the appointment of Usman Buzdar as Punjab chief minister and Khan’s blind confidence in him that remained the main sticking point. The general was also unhappy with Khan over what he described as his lacklustre approach to foreign policy issues. He seemed upset with Khan’s reluctance to visit the UK and some other countries important to Pakistan’s interests. By then, it seemed that the general had already opened a channel with the PML-N leadership, as also confirmed by Khawaja Asif. He told me about his frequent meetings with Shehbaz Sharif for whom he had developed a strong liking. However, at the same time, the general would appear highly contemptuous while talking about his meeting with him and other opposition leaders. He told me that when he asked Shehbaz Sharif about the money-laundering case against him and members of his family, the latter replied that his children had made a ‘mistake’. He also narrated a story about his meeting with Maulana Fazlur Rehman. According to the general, the only request made by the JUI-F chief was that he remove the Khan government. There was no doubt about the general’s grand ambitions but these were never fulfilled. The general may have exited the scene but the involvement of the establishment in political power games has continued. There has only been a change of command.

  "description": "Three terrorists responsible for the martyrdom of Panjgur’s deputy commissioner were killed in an intelligence-based operation by security forces in Mastung during the early hours of August 19, the military’s media wing said. The statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “These terrorists were involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area and were also responsible for the shahadat of Deputy Commissioner of Panjgur, Mr Zakir Ali, on 12 August 2024.” Apart from the three dead, three more terrorists were injured after a fierce exchange of fire took place during the operation, according to the ISPR. “Today’s operation has avenged the heinous act and has brought the perpetrators to justice,” the statement said. “Security forces of Pakistan in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability, and progress of Balochistan,” it added. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for killing the terrorists, adding that the elements involved in terrorism should learn from the fate of the killers of DC Panjgur. “The premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to wipe out the menace of terrorism and said that the war with terrorists will continue until their complete elimination, adding that the entire country stood alongside the armed forces in their fight,” Radio Pakistan reported. Monday’s operation comes after the Balochistan Chief Minister stated in a press conference last Thursday that intelligence information and evidence indicate that Panjgur DC was martyred by the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also visited the province on Sunday where he remarked that the prosperity and development of Balochistan were linked to sustainable peace while visiting the Frontier Corps (South) Balochistan. For decades, the province of Balochistan has been plagued by an insurgency led by separatist groups, some fighting for independence or a greater share of the region’s mineral resources, with security forces often the target of bombings.

  "content": "TEHRAN: At least 35 people were killed and 15 others sustained injuries after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims met with an accident in Yazd, Iran. However, taking to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Pakistan's Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu confirmed the death of 28 pilgrims and said that the remaining 23 were wounded in the accident which occurred around 700 kilometres from the embassy. The ambassador's statement comes after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire near Taftan-Dehshir checkpoint, reported Iranian media. \"Embassy officials have already left for Yazd this morning. An officer in Zahedan is overseeing emergency arrangements,\" the ambassador further said. Speaking with Geo News, the envoy said overspeeding and brake failure caused the ill-fated bus to crash into a school wall. Maulana Qamar Abbas Naqvi — a member of a peace committee based in Larkana — said at least 30 people died on the spot, while five succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. He maintained that the 15 injured are in critical condition. On the other hand, Iran's Mehr News Agency said that the number of killed people in the accident was 28 with emergency imposed in hospitals across the city to treat the injured. The bus, which had 53 passengers on board, met with the accident last night. The police and rescue officials rushed to the scene and shifted the bodies and the injured to the hospital. As per details received from sources earlier today, the bus was carrying more than 50 passengers, including 14 women. They added that 10 people hailed from Khairpur, whereas six were from Kashmore. Syed Athar Shamsi, the leaders of the convoy which left from Larkana to participate in Arbaeen, said that the group of pilgrims were commuting in two buses. The bus moving ahead met with the accident, while the other one was left behind due to documentation related issues. Crisis management director general of Yazd province, while talking to Iranian state TV, confirmed that 11 women and 17 men lost their lives in the accident, reported Reuters. \"Seven of the injured people are in critical condition and six injured people have now left the hospital,\" he said adding that Pakistan's consular services in Iran have been invited to Yazd province to follow up on the accident. Iranian traffic police have said that preliminary investigations reveal that the accident was caused by a technical defect in the bus braking system. Speaking to Geo.tv Maulana Shah Murad Sharifi, a Qom seminary student hailing from Larkana, said that the pilgrims' convoy comprised two buses carrying around 52 passengers each. Elaborating on the current situation, he said that apart from five to six people who suffered minor injuries, most of the passengers of the ill-fated bus were in critical condition and were being treated in a local government hospital. When asked about what caused the fatal accident, Sharifi said he had heard people saying that the vehicle's brakes had failed before the accident. Reacting to the incident, President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed grief and regret over the loss of precious life. The president has directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance to the wounded and help bring the bodies back to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PT) leader and National Assembly Opposition Leade Omar Ayub have also separately expressed condolences and prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded pilgrims."

  "content": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and her Sindh counterpart Murad Ali Shah traded barbs over the recently announced power subsidy worth Rs45 billion in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-ruled province amid criticism from the friends and foes alike.  The Punjab government announced Rs14 cut per unit in the electricity bills for August and September under a power subsidy plan for the consumers in the province, using 201 to 500 units.  The decision drew criticism from the party's political archrival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the major ruling allies Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), as the latter termed the power subsidy a short-term relief and the decision taken merely for optics. The most recent was a war of words between the Punjab and Sindh CMs Maryam and Murad Ali Shah, as the PPP stalwart said on Monday that the move was a \"folly\" and he doesn't even know how to respond to such \"impractical announcements\".  Reacting to his remarks today (Tuesday), the Punjab CM, without naming Murad, said that she found Sindh CM's remark funny. \"I ask, putting the corruption money in own pockets, spending money on protocols, helicopters, aircrafts, convoys of vehicles, salaries and houses isn't a 'folly' but giving relief to the masses is,\" Maryam said while addressing an event in Lahore. She said that the the relief was not \"short term\" as the provincial government was planning to introduce a \"massive\" solar energy programme soon.  \"This will rid the masses of the bills once and forever,\" she added.  Meanwhile, in a separate statement given today, Shah lamented that the Centre was not spending money for the welfare of Sindh's masses.  \"When the fiscal year started, we informed the federal government that we [Sindh government] needs funds for a project but it told us it doesn't have the funds,\" he claimed.  \"Where did the Centre get the money all of a sudden to throw good money after bad,\" he asked.  He said that the PML-N government is now turning to solar power after setting up \"high cost power plants on imported coal and LNG and restraining the Sindh government from setting up wind and solar power plants\". Responding to this, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a cabinet meeting today claimed that the Punjab government had announced the relief from its own resources and that the federal government had no contribution in it. \"The other provincial governments can also provide such relief but they shouldn't politicise the matter,\" he added.  On Friday, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif along with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced to slash the development fund to give Rs14 per unit relief in power bills to consumers using 201 to 500 units for the two months. The PML-N president, patting the shoulder of her daughter CM Maryam, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. PM Shehbaz had also welcomed the \"historic\" relief package for electricity consumers by the Punjab chief minister. He said efforts are being made to find a lasting and sustainable solution to power crisis by taking measures against electricity theft and reforms in the power sector. The premier said recently, his administration diverted Rs50 billion from the development budget of the federal government and gave relief in electricity prices for consumers using up to 200 units."

  "content": "The Lahore police have arrested a man for publishing a \"fake news\" story that allegedly triggered widespread anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom earlier this month. DIG Operations Faisal Kamran confirmed on Tuesday that the man involved in spreading the disinformation had been arrested in Lahore last night.  During the last few weeks, Britain witnessed widespread riots after misinformation spread about the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the knife attack that left three minor girls dead on July 29 this year. The recent riots saw numerous mosques, asylum centres and immigrant homes being attacked in several regions of Britain. Sharing an update on X, formerly Twitter on August 14, the UK police authorities said that they had arrested over 1,000 people in connection with the weeks-long riots in England. The UK police further said that at least 575 people have been charged, as courts continue to deal with those involved in the disorder, which occurred across dozens of towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland. The Lahore police official said that the suspect identified as Farhan Asif was arrested last night in the provincial capital's DHA area and was handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime wing for interrogation. Farhan Asif works for a news platform based in Pakistan, DIG Kamran said, adding that the individual has been charged with spreading \"fake news” regarding the identity of the killer of three children who were stabbed to death. The police official added that fake news caused violent riots and protests in Britain, adding that the accused was probed and was found involved in disseminating fake news. The FIA sources told Geo News that the investigating agency’s Additional Director Cybercrime Chaudhry Sarfaraz is leading the investigation. The FIA sources further said that Farhan had confessed to interrogators that he once published a story on his news website without knowing that the post would go viral.  Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were killed in the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town of Southport on July 29. The assault also left eight children and two adults wounded. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested. However, due to his age, his identity was not disclosed. But, misinformation about the suspect's Muslim identity began circulating online. Social media reports named him Ali-Al-Shakati, claiming he migrated to the UK by boat in 2023.  These social media claims that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant triggered anti-immigrant riots across the UK."

  "content": "A new Toshakhana reference against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi has been filed in a case pertaining to a jewelley set gifted by the Saudi crown prince. NAB investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan filed the new reference — which as per the sources consists of two volumes — in an accountability court on Tuesday. The development came after the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) interrogated the deposed prime minister and his spouse at the Adiala jail in connection with the case. The registrar of the accountability courts will review the reference and send it to the administrative judge after removing the objections.  The administrative judge will then decide whether to conduct hearing himself or transfer it to another accountability court. It should be noted that administrative Judge Nasir Javed Rana is already hearing the £190 million reference against the PTI founder. The couple was arrested in new Toshakhana case on July 13 hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted them in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail before the filing of the new cases. A day earlier, accountability court had sent the PTI founder and Bushra to jail on a 15-day judicial remand in the other new Toshakhana reference after completion of the probe by NAB. During the hearing of the other reference on Monday, the couple submitted the responses to the questionnaire by NAB. The hearing on August 19, held at the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, was conducted by Accountability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana. Khan, who has been behind bars since August last year after he was sentenced in the Toshakhana criminal case, and subsequently sentenced in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections. Despite securing relief in several cases, the former premier's legal troubles refused to die down as he was booked in several other cases including those related to the May 9 mayhem when alleged supporters of his party attacked and ransacked state properties including military installations following his arrest in a corruption case last year.  New reference pertains to a case related to jewellery set gifted by Saudi crown prince The new NAB reference pertains to a case related to a jewellery set gifted to former first lady Bushra Bibi by the Saudi crown prince when Khan was the prime minister of the country from 2018 to 2022.  The jewellery set — comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings — was gifted to the former first lady on her visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2021, as per the NAB's reference. It said the PTI founder and his wife have illegally kept the jewellery set. It added that the deputy military secretary briefed the Toshakhana section officer to estimate and declare the price of the jewellery set. The jewellery set, it mentioned, was not deposited in Toshakhana. The jewellery company sold the necklace for €300,000 and earrings for €80,000 on May 25, 2018. The information regarding the price of the bracelet and ring could not be obtained from the company. On May 28, 2021, the price of jewellery set estimated at Rs70.56 million; the price of the necklace Rs50.64 million and the price of the earrings included in the jewellery valued at Rs10.50 million back then. According to the rules, the 50% price of the jewellery set is approximately Rs30.57 million.  The national exchequer suffered a loss of approximately Rs30.28 after the jewellery was undervalued.  As per the reference, the PTI founder and his wife violated the NAB Ordinance. It added that an inquiry was initiated against the former first couple on the instructions of NAB chairman on August 1, 2022. “PTI founder and Bushra Bibi have misused their powers. PTI founder retained 58 out of 108 gifts during his prime ministership,” read the reference."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi has been discharged by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi in 12 cases related to the May 9, 2023, violent protests. The hearing was conducted by ATC Judge Malik Ejaz Asif at a makeshift court in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail. The hearing was also attended by investigation officers of the May 9 cases. At the outset of the hearing, defence counsels gave arguments regarding Bushra's physical remand, whereas, the wife of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was represented by her counsel Salman Safdar and Advocate Malik Faisal.   However, the ATC judge rejected the Rawalpindi Police's plea seeking phycial remand of the former first lady in the May 9 cases. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court decided to discharge Bushra in the cases. Speaking to media outside the Central Jail Rawalpindi, Bushra's lawyer Safdar claimed that the court acquitted her in all cases in which she was nominated in light of different statements. He added that the court also rejected the prosecution's evidence during today's hearing and rejected the credibility of any statement from a co-accused. The lawyer said that the PTI founder was given a clean chit in the cipher case, however, a detailed verdict has not been issued yet. Commenting on the ATC's verdict, he said that four prosecutors from the state appeared in today's hearing. Safdar said that the government reserved right to challenge the ATC verdict in any court. Bushra has been behind bars for months in different cases since her arrest in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — in February 2024, however, she and her husband were acquitted in the said case by a local court which overturned their sentences last month. Despite getting bail and acquitted in several cases, her legal woes refused to die down as Bushra was also nominated in many other cases, including May 9, 2023, violence cases. The May 9 riots were triggered by the PTI founder's arrest last year during which alleged supporters of his party damaged and attacked state properties including military installations. During the protests, the miscreants targeted the civil and military installations including — Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi. The military termed the May 9 violent protests as \"Black Day\" and decided to try the protesters under the Army Act."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Security forces have eliminated three Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists responsible for Panjgur deputy commissioner Zakir Baloch's martyrdom earlier this month, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Today's operation has avenged the heinous act and has brought the perpetrators to justice,\" the military's media wing said while referring to the intelligence-based operation (IBO) conducted in Balochistan's Mastung district between August 18 and 19. Providing details on the IBO, the ISPR said that three terrorists were injured owing to an intense exchange during the security forces' action. Noting that the militants were involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area, the ISPR reaffirmed the forces' resolve to thwart attempts at sabotaging the peace, stability and progress of Balochistan. \"Security forces of Pakistan in step with the Nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan,\" the statement added. The senior bureaucrat was shot dead on the National Highway near the Khada-Kucha area of Mastung district on August 12. Baloch along with District Chairman Malik Jan and his friend Ahmed Jan was on his way to Quetta from Panjgur in a vehicle when the armed assailants opened fire at them near the Kand Umrani area and managed to escape from the scene, Levies sources had said. As a result, the DC and his friends sustained bullet injuries. After being informed, rescue officials rushed to the scene and shifted them to a nearby hospital. The DC succumbed to his injuries during the treatment. Both injured were referred to Quetta Civil Hospital's trauma centre for further treatment. A day earlier, three soldiers embraced martyrdom in a gun battle with terrorists who were trying to infiltrate Pakistan via the Afghanistan border near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) Bajaur. Meanwhile, five khwarij of Fitna al Khwarij were neutralised in the shootout. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents were reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations."

  "content": "KARACHI: The City Court remanded the woman, suspected of killing two people in a car crash on Karachi's Karsaz Road, into police custody for one day on Tuesday. The special magistrate judge has ordered to produce the suspect in the court tomorrow (Wednesday) with a proper medical report. Amir Altaf, the police investigating officer, had requested a seven-day physical remand of the defendant. A first information report (FIR) was filed on Monday against the female driver involved in the accident that killed at least two people and wounded five others on Monday Police and Rangers had taken the woman driver, identified in the first information report (FIR) as Natasha, into custody and brought her to the police station following the mishap and impounded her jeep. The security personnel had later taken her to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a medical check-up as she also received an injury to her head. The IO submitted a report about the suspect’s non-appearance before the court, saying that JPMC hospital psychiatric specialist, Chunni Laal, had admitted the suspect to the hospital after examining her condition. According to the doctor the suspect was not in a condition to be allowed for an appearance before the court, said the IO while apprising the judge.  “Since the mental condition of the accused is critical, she could not, therefore, be brought to the court as per doctor’s instruction,” the investigation officer maintained. Prior to the hearing, the suspect’s lawyer, Amir Mansoob said his client was a psychiatric patient and had been under treatment for her condition for five years.  “Such patients are kept in isolation ward and they do not remember anything. She took out the vehicle without [anyone’s] permission,” he said. The counsel added that the patient was not in a condition to be produced before the court. On the lawyer’s request for his client’s bail, the court said it could not grant bail without the suspect’s appearance before it. Moreover, the court said that the judge did not have the authority to grant bail, as he was on special magisterial duty. When court asked the IO if the woman’s driving license was confiscated, the police official responded in the negative. The lawyer told the court that his client possessed a driving license of the United Kingdom and not Pakistan. Adjourning the hearing till tomorrow, the court inquired how the UK license could be acceptable in Pakistan. On the other hand, Geo News has obtained a CCTV footage of the unfortunate incident, wherein the father and daughter could be seen commuting on a bike. A speeding white luxury vehicle is also seen following and hitting the bike in the video. The woman does not stop the vehicle after crashing into the motorcycle and runs away. Police said investigation was expedited with the help of the surveillance camera footage. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on Monday. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The detained woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. Her husband also reached the police station after receiving information of the incident. Police said the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that Natasha hit his brother’s bike from rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving licence, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. Whereas, they said, charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR. Meanwhile, police have asked the family for the medical history of the suspect involved in the accident. Blood and urine samples had been taken for medico-legal examination of the suspect, said police surgeon. According to the woman's husband, she took medication for mental stress. Police said the accident was being investigated from various aspects and they were also trying to obtain CCTV footage of the incident. Rescue sources said the father and daughter’s bodies were kept in Edhi mortuary and their funeral prayer would be offered after Asr prayers."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Pakistan successfully carried out a training launch of surface-to-surface Shaheen II ballistic missile to validate various technical parameters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Tuesday.  The launch, as per the military's media wing, was also aimed at performance evaluation of different sub-systems incorporated for improved accuracy and enhanced survivability. The training launch was witnessed by senior officers from the Strategic Plans Division, Army Strategic Forces Command, scientists and engineers of strategic organisations, the ISPR added.

  "content": "KARACHI: In the wake of the threat posed by the recent global outbreak of the monkeypox virus, the Federal Ministry of Health has issued strict guidelines provisioning screening, isolation and other preventive measures at the country's  international airports. The ministry's notification dated August 18 referred to the outbreak being termed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and said: \"To mitigate the risk of international spread, it is essential for all international airports in Pakistan to implement strict preventive measures.\" The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are issued by the ministry provisions screenings for passengers and crew members upon arrival and also conditions the issuance of visa on arrival to health clearance of the passengers. The development comes as the country has reported at least one mpox case after a new variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and was linked to a growing outbreak in Africa — the first sign of its spread outside the continent. As per the WHO, mpox is a viral disease related to the now-eradicated smallpox virus and can spread through any close contact and through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles. Initial symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, muscle pain, swelling of the glands, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness which are often followed by a painful or itchy rash with raised lesions that scab over and resolve over a period of weeks. A day earlier, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) on Sunday directed all airlines flying into Pakistan from abroad to adopt preventive measures such as providing face masks to passengers, ensuring sanitising of the hands of staff and passengers as well as disinfection of the luggage. As per the health ministry's guidelines, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be responsible for facilitating the implementation of health measures without disrupting airport activities and will ensure compliance with the SOPs by carrying out regular inspections and audits. Meanwhile, the Border Health Services (BHS) — working as the lead agency responsible for the overall coordination and management of mpox-related operations at international airports — manages the isolation and safe transportation of suspected mpox cases to designated medical facilities. The BHS will also report confirmed cases to local and national health authorities and maintain surveillance data. The BHS has implemented thermal scanning at all entry points to detect passengers with fever, a common symptom of mpox, and their personnel will also conduct visual inspections and symptom checks to identify any passengers displaying signs of the disease. Passengers or crew members identified as potential mpox cases will be immediately isolated in a designated area within the airport. The authority will also enforce quarantine measures for passengers who have been in close contact with a confirmed mpox case, in accordance with national and international health guidelines. In the event of a confirmed mpox case, the authority will initiate contact tracing procedures for all individuals who were in proximity to the infected person during the flight or at the airport. Passengers identified through contact tracing will be monitored for symptoms and provided with instructions on how to report any health concerns. Meanwhile, the authorities have cleared a suspect patient of mpox being treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) of the virus. Officials said that the suspected patient, a 47-year-old man from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), had reached Islamabad from Jeddah a few days ago and was treated as a suspected case of mpox due to chest pain. However, he was declared \"clear\" of the disease following a test by the National Institute of Health (NIH)."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In response to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) announcement to hold a powershow in Islamabad, Federal Minister for Information & Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said on Monday that he did not believe the party would be given permission.  Speaking to the Geo News show \"Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath\" on Monday, the federal minister said, \"Considering their track record, I don't think they will be allowed to rally in the federal capital.\" Meanwhile, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat has expressed determination of his party in this regard, saying they would hold rally on Thursday, rain or shine. Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Sunday said PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had \"decided\" to hold a powershow in Islamabad on August 22, after a protracted struggle to hold a rally in the city. Saif had reassured that the party would try to avoid any violation of the law on their part. Tarar said their recent past’s action could be taken into account to check veracity of the claim of its being a peaceful event. He also asked which PTI protest had ever been peaceful. “One does not become peaceful [merely] by saying [so], one has to prove it,” he said. Ostensibly, in response to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric of holding rally in the federal capital, \"come what may\", he said it was not the first time as former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak too had come with cranes and modern equipment. The minister said despite the fact that Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)’s recent sit-in protest against inflated electricity bills was peaceful, they were not allowed to enter Islamabad. He suggested the KP government to focus on health, education and anti-terrorism activities in the province. In the same programme, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they would not stop from holding the rally on August 22, even if the government used force against them. “The KP's caravan will be monumental and no one will be able to block it even if they try,” he said. The PTI lawmaker said they would not be carrying any weapons or petrol bombs. Instead, he said, they would be armless and peaceful. “We will remain peaceful,” he said. However, “if there is violence or firing, the whole Pakistan will rise up,” he warned.  "

  "content": "TEHRAN: At least 35 people were killed and 15 others sustained serious injuries after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims met with an accident in Yazd, Iran. However, taking to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Pakistan's Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu confirmed the death of 28 pilgrims and said that the remaining 23 were wounded in the accident which occurred around 700 kilometres from the embassy. The ambassador's statement comes after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire near Taftan-Dehshir checkpoint, reported Iranian media. \"Embassy officials have already left for Yazd this morning. An officer in Zahedan is overseeing emergency arrangements,\" the ambassador further said. Speaking with Geo News, the envoy said overspeeding and brake failure caused the ill-fated bus to crash into a school wall. According to  Maulana Qamar Abbas Naqvi — a member of a peace committee based in Larkana — said at least 30 people died on the spot, while five succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. On the other hand, Iran's Mehr News Agency said that the number of killed people in the accident was 28 with emergency imposed in hospitals across the city to treat the injured. The bus, which had 53 passengers on board, met with the accident last night. The police and rescue officials rushed to the scene and shifted the bodies and the injured to the hospital. As per details received from sources earlier today, the bus was carrying more than 50 passengers, including 14 women.  They added that 10 people hailed from Khairpur, whereas six were from Kashmore. Syed Athar Shamsi, the leaders of the convoy which left from Larkana to participate in Arbaeen, said that the group of pilgrims were commuting in two buses. The bus moving ahead met with the accident, while the other one was left behind due to documentation related issues. Crisis management director general of Yazd province, while talking to Iranian state TV, confirmed that 11 women and 17 men lost their lives in the accident, reported Reuters. \"Seven of the injured people are in critical condition and six injured people have now left the hospital,\" he said adding that Pakistan's consular services in Iran have been invited to Yazd province to follow up on the accident. Iranian traffic police have said that preliminary investigations reveal that the accident was caused by a technical defect in the bus braking system. Speaking to Geo.tv Maulana Shah Murad Sharifi, a Qom seminary student hailing from Larkana, said that the pilgrims' convoy comprised two buses carrying around 52 passengers each.  Elaborating on the current situation, he said that apart from five to six people who suffered minor injuries, most of the passengers of the ill-fated bus were in critical condition and were being treated in a local government hospital. When asked about what caused the fatal accident, Sharifi said he had heard people saying that the vehicle's brakes had failed before the accident. Reacting to the incident, President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed grief and regret over the loss of precious life. The president has directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance to the wounded and help bring the bodies back to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PT) leader and National Assembly Opposition Leade Omar Ayub have also separately expressed condolences and prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded pilgrims."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday called on youth to work hard to make the country an economic power, saying that there is \"no room for terrorism\" in the name of \"disgruntlement\". The deputy prime minister said this in response to the reports he received during his visit to Balochistan on Independence Day last week that some disgruntled Baloch youth were involved in terror activities. “I believe that no one can be disgruntled with his own motherland. We should resolve the issues amicably,\" he said, addressing the Youth Convention held in the federal capital today.  \"There is no room for terrorism in the name of disgruntlement. This is not acceptable.”  He further said that the government was extending facilities to the youth and the Special Investment Facilitation Council — the country's top investment body — was also focusing on their empowerment as they could become a source of investment in education, skill development and technology. Dar said Pakistan’s youth had the potential to become change makers but it required unity, a continuous learning process and setting aside hatred, extremism, and personal biases. He said during his four terms as finance minister, he always prioritised funding projects aimed at youth empowerment. The deputy prime minister stressed that the nation’s united efforts and youth’s excellence in education and innovation were inevitable to develop Pakistan as an economic power. “I believe that Pakistan was created in the name of Allah. This can never fail. It has to prosper. It has to develop and lead the Muslim Ummah one day. You have the potential… If we put in our efforts, we can become an economic power. Once we become an economic power, we will lead the Muslim Ummah,” he said.  The PML-N leader advised the youth to avail education opportunities in classrooms as well as outside, opt for new technologies, and explore new avenues. He also asked the youth to beware of the enemies within which were poised to destroy the country. “The world knows that being a missile power, you can lead the 57-state Muslim world. Pakistan as a nuclear power is not acceptable to some global powers. They can’t defeat Pakistan through conventional methods but they can patronise and promote their stooges to destroy Pakistan,” he commented. He told the gathering of vice-chancellors, students and educationists that during the 2013-2018 PML-N government, Pakistan was projected to become a member of G-20 nations as the country was taking off that time with 2% food inflation, 3.7% consumer price index, 6% growth and the most stable currency in South Asia. He said the PDM government was aimed at saving Pakistan as its enemies desired to see it default. Recalling Pakistan’s journey of becoming a nuclear power in 1998, he said that the government did not compromise the national defence."

  "content": " As Punjab government continues to face criticism over the power subsidy worth Rs45 billion, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz responded to the latest jibe from her Sindh counterpart Murad Ali Shah, saying that the relief was not a \"folly\".  The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government announced Rs14 cut per unit in the electricity bills for August and September under a power subsidy plan for the consumers using 201 to 500 units.  The decision drew criticism from the party's political archrival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the major ruling allies Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), as the latter termed the power subsidy a short-term relief and the decision  taken merely for optics. The most recent was a war of words between the Punjab and Sindh CMs Maryam and Murad Ali Shah, as the PPP stalwart said on Monday that the move was a \"folly\" and he doesn't even know how to respond to such \"impractical announcements\".  Reacting to his remarks today (Tuesday), the Punjab CM, without naming Murad, said that she found Sindh CM's remark funny. \"I ask, putting the corruption money in own pockets, spending money on protocols, helicopters, aircrafts, convoys of vehicles, salaries and houses isn't a 'folly' but giving relief to the masses is,\" Maryam said while addressing an event in Lahore.  She said that the the relief was not \"short term\" as the provincial government was planning to introduce a \"massive\" solar energy programme soon.  \"This will rid the masses of the bills once and forever,\" she added.  Meanwhile, in a separate statement given today, Shah lamented that the Centre was not spending money for the welfare of Sindh's masses.  \"When the fiscal year started, we informed the federal government that we [Sindh government] needs funds for a project but it told us it doesn't have the funds,\" he claimed.  \"Where did the Centre get the money all of a sudden to throw good money after bad,\" he asked.  He said that the PML-N government is now turning to solar power after setting up \"high cost power plants on imported coal and LNG and restraining the Sindh government from setting up wind and solar power plants\".  Responding to this, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a cabinet meeting today claimed that the Punjab government had announced the relief from its own resources and that the federal government had no contribution in it. \"The other provincial governments can also provide such relief but they shouldn't politicise the matter,\" he added.  On Friday, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif along with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced to slash the development fund to give Rs14 per unit relief in power bills to consumers using 201 to 500 units for the two months. The PML-N president, patting the shoulder of her daughter CM Maryam, thanked her that she slashed flour prices when she assumed power in the province. PM Shehbaz had also welcomed the \"historic\" relief package for electricity consumers by the Punjab chief minister. He said efforts are being made to find a lasting and sustainable solution to power crisis by taking measures against electricity theft and reforms in the power sector. The premier said recently, his administration diverted Rs50 billion from the development budget of the federal government and gave relief in electricity prices for consumers using up to 200 units."

  "content": " Weeks after a fake news sparked anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom, a Pakistani man allegedly involved in spreading the false information was taken into custody in Lahore, DIG Operations Faisal Kamran confirmed on Tuesday. During the last few weeks, Britain witnessed widespread riots after misinformation spread about the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the knife attack that left three minor girls dead on July 29 this year. The recent riots saw numerous mosques, asylum centres and immigrant homes being attacked in several regions of Britain.   Sharing an update on X, formerly Twitter on August 14, the UK police authorities said that they had arrested over 1,000 people in connection with the weeks-long riots in England. The UK police further said that at least 575 people have been charged, as courts continue to deal with those involved in the disorder, which occurred across dozens of towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland. The Lahore police official said that the suspect identified as Farhan Asif was arrested last night in the provincial capital's DHA area and was handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime wing for interrogation. Farhan Asif works for a news platform based in Pakistan, DIG Kamran said, adding that the individual has been charged with spreading \"fake news” regarding the identity of the killer of three children who were stabbed to death. The police official added that fake news caused violent riots and protests in Britain, adding that the accused was probed and was found involved in disseminating fake news. The FIA sources told Geo News that the investigating agency’s Additional Director Cybercrime Chaudhry Sarfaraz is leading the investigation. The FIA sources further said that Farhan had confessed to interrogators that he once published a story on his news website without knowing that the post would go viral.  Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were killed in the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town of Southport on July 29. The assault also left eight children and two adults wounded. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested. However, due to his age, his identity was not disclosed. But, misinformation about the suspect's Muslim identity began circulating online. Social media reports named him Ali-Al-Shakati, claiming he migrated to the UK by boat in 2023.  These social media claims that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant triggered anti-immigrant riots across the UK."

  "content": "  RAWALPINDI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Tuesday discharged former prime minister Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi in 12 cases related to May 9, 2023, riots. The hearing was conducted by ATC Judge Malik Ejaz Asif at a makeshift court in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail. The hearing was also attended by investigation officers of the May 9 cases. At the outset of the hearing, defence counsels gave arguments regarding Bushra's physical remand, whereas, the wife of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was represented by her counsel Salman Safdar and Advocate Malik Faisal. However, the ATC judge rejected the Rawalpindi Police's plea seeking phycial remand of the former first lady in the May 9 cases. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court decided to discharge Bushra in the cases. Speaking to media outside the Central Jail Rawalpindi, Bushra's lawyer Safdar claimed that the court acquitted her in all cases in which she was nominated in light of different statements. He added that the court also rejected the prosecution's evidence during today's hearing and rejected the credibility of any statement from a co-accused. The lawyer said that the PTI founder was given a clean chit in the cipher case, however, a detailed verdict has not been issued yet. Commenting on the ATC's verdict, he said that four prosecutors from the state appeared in today's hearing. Safdar said that the government reserved right to challenge the ATC verdict in any court. Bushra has been behind bars for months in different cases since her arrest in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — in February 2024, however, she and her husband were acquitted in the said case by a local court which overturned their sentences last month. Despite getting bail and acquitted in several cases, her legal woes refused to die down as Bushra was also nominated in many other cases, including May 9, 2023, violence cases. The May 9 riots were triggered by the PTI founder's arrest last year during which alleged supporters of his party damaged and attacked state properties including military installations. During the protests, the miscreants targeted the civil and military installations including — Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi. The military termed the May 9 violent protests as \"Black Day\" and decided to try the protesters under the Army Act."

  "content": "The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday filed a fresh Toshakhana reference against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a case pertaining to a jewellery set gifted by the Saudi crown prince. The development comes after the anti-graft body interrogated the former prime minister and his wife at the Adiala jail, as per the reference. The reference — which consists of two volumes — was filed by NAB investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan in an accountability court. The fresh reference will now be reviewed by the registrar of the accountability courts. After removing the objections, the reference will be sent to the administrative judge of the accountability court. The administrative judge will then decide whether to conduct hearing himself or transfer it to another accountability court. It should be noted that administrative Judge Nasir Javed Rana is already hearing the £190 million reference against the PTI founder. The couple was arrested in new Toshakhana case on July 13 hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted them in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail before the filing of the new cases. A day earlier, accountability court had sent the PTI founder and Bushra to jail on a 15-day judicial remand in the other new Toshakhana reference after completion of the probe by NAB. During the hearing of the other reference on Monday, the couple submitted the responses to the questionnaire by NAB. The hearing on August 19, held at the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, was conducted by Accountability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana. Khan, who has been behind bars since August last year after he was sentenced in the Toshakhana criminal case, and subsequently sentenced in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections. Despite securing relief in several cases, the former premier's legal troubles refused to die down as he was booked in several other cases including those related to the May 9 mayhem when alleged supporters of his party attacked and ransacked state properties including military installations following his arrest in a corruption case last year.  The new NAB reference pertains to a case related to a jewellery set gifted to former first lady Bushra Bibi by the Saudi crown prince when Khan was the prime minister of the country from 2018 to 2022.  The jewellery set — comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings — was gifted to the former first lady on her visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2021, as per the NAB's reference. It said the PTI founder and his wife have illegally kept the jewellery set. It added that the deputy military secretary briefed the Toshakhana section officer to estimate and declare the price of the jewellery set. The jewellery set, it mentioned, was not deposited in Toshakhana. The jewellery company sold the necklace for €300,000 and earrings for €80,000 on May 25, 2018. The information regarding the price of the bracelet and ring could not be obtained from the company. On May 28, 2021, the price of jewellery set estimated at Rs70.56 million; the price of the necklace Rs50.64 million and the price of the earrings included in the jewellery valued at Rs10.50 million back then. According to the rules, the 50% price of the jewellery set is approximately Rs30.57 million.   The national exchequer suffered a loss of approximately Rs30.28 after the jewellery was undervalued.  As per the reference, the PTI founder and his wife violated the NAB Ordinance. It added that an inquiry was initiated against the former first couple on the instructions of NAB chairman on August 1, 2022. “PTI founder and Bushra Bibi have misused their powers. PTI founder retained 58 out of 108 gifts during his prime ministership,” read the reference."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: After arresting former jail deputy superintendent, the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have taken six more employees of the Adiala jail into custody for allegedly aiding Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, sources told Geo News on Tuesday. The sources said three members of the jail employees' network involved in alleged facilitation of the former prime minister were women. The LEAs will investigate these workers. The aforementioned employees included a sweeper, two lady wardens and three officials posted on monitoring surveillance cameras in the jail premises, they said.  The sources said the female staff passed on messages between Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi in the prison, adding cell phones of all those employees were confiscated as well.  Meanwhile, they said, manpower for monitoring of the Adiala jail had also been increased. The sources, on August 14, said that the former deputy superintendent of Adiala jail Muhammad Akram had been taken into custody on charges of aiding the incarcerated PTI founder. Akram was removed from his post on June 20, while Deputy Superintendent Judicial Tahir Siddique Shah replaced him as security supervisor of Imran.  The Punjab home department (prison section), through a notification, had removed Muhammad Akram, directing him to leave the charge and report to the Prisons Department, Lahore. The law enforcement agencies had started interrogating the arrested senior officer of Central Jail Rawalpindi — also known as Adiala jail. The sources had said Akram would allegedly convey the jailed PTI founder's messages outside the prison facility secretly. They said the LEAs had formally informed the inspector general of prisons, Punjab, regarding the senior police officer’s arrest and probe.  The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than a year after he was booked in plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case. His wife, Bushra Bibi, has also been behind bars for months. However, a court suspended his sentence in the Toshakhana case, while other courts overturned his convictions in the cipher and iddat cases, respectively. While there were hopes for Khan and Bushra's release in July, they were dashed when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested them on fresh charges related to the sale of state gifts. The chances of Imran's release from jail further dimmed after the Lahore Police declared his arrest in several cases related to the May 9, 2023, riots, that erupted after his detainment from from Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises last year in which protesters targeted government and military installations."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: As part of ongoing efforts to curb the menace of terrorism, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and eliminated three Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists responsible for martyrdom of Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Zakir Baloch. \"Today's operation has avenged the heinous act and has brought the perpetrators to justice,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Tuesday.  According to the military's media wing, the operation was carried out between August 18 and 19. The statement comes as the late bureaucrat was shot dead on the National Highway near the Khada-Kucha area of Mastung district on August 12. Baloch along with District Chairman Malik Jan and his friend Ahmed Jan was on his way to Quetta from Panjgur in a vehicle when the armed assailants opened fire at them near the Kand Umrani area and managed to escape from the scene, Levies sources had said. As a result, the DC and his friends sustained bullet injuries. After being informed, rescue officials rushed to the scene and shifted them to a nearby hospital. The DC succumbed to his injuries during the initial treatment process. Both injured were referred to Quetta Civil Hospital's trauma centre for further treatment. Providing details on the IBO, the ISPR said that three terrorists were injured owing to an intense exchange during the security forces' action. Noting that the militants were involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area, the ISPR reaffirmed the forces' resolve to thwart attempts at sabotaging the peace, stability and progress of Balochistan. A day earlier, three soldiers embraced martyrdom in a gun battle with terrorists who were trying to infiltrate Pakistan via the Afghanistan border near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) Bajaur. Meanwhile, five khwarij of Fitna al Khwarij were neutralised in the shootout. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents were reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations."

  "content": "KARACHI: The City Court on Tuesday sent a woman, suspected of killing two people in a road accident on Karsaz Road in the metropolis, on a one-day physical remand. The special magistrate judge also directed the production of the suspect in the court tomorrow (Wednesday) with a proper medical report. The investigation officer of the police, Amir Altaf, had sought a seven-day remand of the suspect. A case was lodged against the female driver involved in the accident that killed at least two people and wounded five others on Monday. Police and Rangers had taken the woman driver, identified in the first information report (FIR) as Natasha, into custody and brought her to the police station following the mishap and impounded her jeep. The security personnel had later taken her to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a medical check-up as she also received an injury to her head.  The IO submitted a report about the suspect’s non-appearance before the court, saying that JPMC hospital psychiatric specialist, Chunni Laal, had admitted the suspect to the hospital after examining her condition.  According to the doctor the suspect was not in a condition to be allowed for an appearance before the court, said the IO while apprising the judge. “Since the mental condition of the accused is critical, she could not, therefore, be brought to the court as per doctor’s instruction,” the investigation officer maintained.  Prior to the hearing, the suspect’s lawyer, Amir Mansoob said his client was a psychiatric patient and had been under treatment for her condition for five years.  “Such patients are kept in isolation ward and they do not remember anything. She took out the vehicle without [anyone’s] permission,” he said. The counsel added that the patient was not in a condition to be produced before the court. On the lawyer’s request for his client’s bail, the court said it could not grant bail without the suspect’s appearance before it. Moreover, the court said that the judge did not have the authority to grant bail, as he was on special magisterial duty. When court asked the IO if the woman’s driving license was confiscated, the police official responded in the negative.  The lawyer told the court that his client possessed a driving license of the United Kingdom and not Pakistan.  Adjourning the hearing till tomorrow, the court inquired how the UK license could be acceptable in Pakistan. On the other hand, Geo News has obtained a CCTV footage of the unfortunate incident, wherein the father and daughter could be seen commuting on a bike. A speeding white luxury vehicle is also seen following and hitting the bike in the video. The woman does not stop the vehicle after crashing into the motorcycle and runs away. Police said investigation was expedited with the help of the surveillance camera footage. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on Monday. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively.  Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The detained woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident.  Her husband also reached the police station after receiving information of the incident. Police said the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that Natasha hit his brother’s bike from rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\".  Police said since the suspect had a driving licence, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. Whereas, they said, charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR. Meanwhile, police have asked the family for the medical history of the suspect involved in the accident. Blood and urine samples had been taken for medico-legal examination of the suspect, said police surgeon. According to the woman's husband, she took medication for mental stress. Police said the accident was being investigated from various aspects and they were also trying to obtain CCTV footage of the incident. Rescue sources said the father and daughter’s bodies were kept in Edhi mortuary and their funeral prayer would be offered after Asr prayers."

The launch was aimed at training troops, validating various technical parameters and performance evaluation of different sub-systems incorporated for improved accuracy and enhanced survivability, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. The military's media wing also noted that the launch was witnessed by senior officers from the Strategic Plans Division, Army Strategic Forces Command, scientists and engineers of strategic organisations.

Furthermore, President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the three services chiefs also congratulated the scientists and engineers on this accomplishment. Today's training launch comes as the country's security forces often carry out routine test launches of various missiles in its arsenal.  Last month, the Pakistan Navy, demonstrated combat readiness via successful live weapon firing of FN-6 surface-to-air missiles (SAM) in Karachi. During the impressive firepower demonstration, the PN's GBAD system fired SAMs and successfully engaged the intended airborne targets."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: On Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)'s announcement to hold a rally in the federal capital, Federal Minister for Information & Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said on Monday he did not think the opposition party would get permission to do so.  “Viewing their past record, I don’t believe they will be allowed to rally in Islamabad,” the information minister said while speaking to the Geo News programme \"Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath\". Following a prolonged struggle to hold a powershow in Islamabad, PTI founder Imran Khan \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22, said Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Sunday.  Saif had reassured that the party would try to avoid any violation of the law on their part. Tarar said the recent past’s action could be taken into account to check veracity of the claim of its being a peaceful event. He also asked which PTI protest had ever been peaceful.  “One does not become peaceful [merely] by saying [so], one has to prove it,” he said. Ostensibly, in response to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric of holding rally in the federal capital, come what may, he said it was not the first time as former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak too had come with cranes and modern equipment.  The minister said despite the fact that Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)’s recent sit-in protest against inflated electricity bills was peaceful, they were not allowed to enter Islamabad.  He suggested the KP government to focus on health, education and anti-terrorism activities in the province.  In the same programme, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they would not stop from holding the rally on August 22, even if the government used force against them.  “The KP's caravan will be monumental and no one will be able to block it even if they try,” he said. The PTI lawmaker said they would not be carrying any weapons or petrol bombs. Instead, he said, they would be armless and peaceful. “We will remain peaceful,” he said. However, “if there is violence or firing, the whole Pakistan will rise up,” he warned.  "

AFP/FileBHS to carryout thermal, visual inspections at airports.Potential cases to be isolated to prevent further spread.People in contact with confirmed cases to be quarantined.<p...",
  "content": "KARACHI: The Federal Ministry of Health has issued strict guidelines provisioning screening, isolation and other preventive measures at all international airports across the country in light of the threat posed by the recent global outbreak of the monkeypox virus. \"To mitigate the risk of international spread, it is essential for all international airports in Pakistan to implement strict preventive measures,\" read the notification issued by the ministry on August 18 while referring to the outbreak being termed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Furthermore, apart from provisioning screenings for passengers and crew members upon arrival, the government has also linked the issuance of visa on arrival to health clearance of the passengers. The development comes as the country has reported at least one mpox case after a new variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and was linked to a growing outbreak in Africa — the first sign of its spread outside the continent. As per the WHO, mpox is a viral disease related to the now-eradicated smallpox virus and can spread through any close contact and through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles. Initial symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, muscle pain, swelling of the glands, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness which are often followed by a painful or itchy rash with raised lesions that scab over and resolve over a period of weeks. A day earlier, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) on Sunday directed all airlines flying into Pakistan from abroad to adopt preventive measures such as providing face masks to passengers, ensuring sanitising of the hands of staff and passengers as well as disinfection of the luggage. As per the health ministry's guidelines, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be responsible for facilitating the implementation of health measures without disrupting airport activities and will ensure compliance with the SOPs by carrying out regular inspections and audits. Meanwhile, the Border Health Services (BHS) — working as the lead agency responsible for the overall coordination and management of mpox-related operations at international airports — manages the isolation and safe transportation of suspected Mpox cases to designated medical facilities.  The BHS will also report confirmed cases to local and national health authorities and maintain surveillance data. The BHS has implemented thermal scanning at all entry points to detect passengers with fever, a common symptom of mpox, and their personnel will also conduct visual inspections and symptom checks to identify any passengers displaying signs of the disease. Passengers or crew members identified as potential mpox cases will be immediately isolated in a designated area within the airport. The authority will also enforce quarantine measures for passengers who have been in close contact with a confirmed mpox case, in accordance with national and international health guidelines. In the event of a confirmed mpox case, the authority will initiate contact tracing procedures for all individuals who were in proximity to the infected person during the flight or at the airport. Passengers identified through contact tracing will be monitored for symptoms and provided with instructions on how to report any health concerns. Meanwhile, the authorities have cleared a suspect patient of mpox being treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) of the virus. Officials said that the suspected patient, a 47-year-old man from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), had reached Islamabad from Jeddah a few days ago and was treated as a suspected case of mpox due to chest pain. However, he was declared \"clear\" of the disease following a test by the National Institute of Health (NIH)."

  "content": "KARACHI: Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman on Monday reiterated that his party would not become part of any political alliance. Addressing a meeting of the JI office-bearers at Idara Noor-e-Haq in Karachi, Naeem said, “Our alliance will be with the youth and the people.” “There is no [real] democracy in political parties,” the JI leader, adding that the parties come to power with the help of the establishment. The JI leader further alleged that there is “confusion” within the ranks of the political parties and his party could not support the parties hit by confusion. The country would observe a shutter-down strike on August 28, the JI leader said. Later, addressing a press conference, the JI leader said that a “political emperor” had announced relief of Rs14 per electricity unit for two months in only Punjab, which is “nothing but peanuts”.  He demanded a substantial relief in power bills for the entire nation. Naeem demanded that the ruling elite grant substantial relief in electricity bills to the nation. He said the JI is going to observe a strike on August 28, while a mass mobilisation campaign is also on the cards, apart from the four major public conventions held in various cities over the past 11 days. He said the JI had signed a 45-day accord, while only 34 days are remaining. Naeem said the JI would take the youth on board during the days to come, and caravans from each and every corner of the country would march on Islamabad if the government does not fulfil the agreement in letter and spirit. Regarding the non-devolution of powers to local governments, he said the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) government in Sindh has captured all the considerable powers of the LG set-up in open defiance of the country’s constitution. He elaborated that the constitution clearly mentions that administrative, monetary and political powers are to be devolved to the LGs. On the other hand, he said, the elected chairmen are being kept deprived of powers to remove solid waste from roads, the water board and the transport department are kept out of their ambit of powers, and the master plan and development authorities are also kept out of their control. The JI leader said the PPP neither delivers in Karachi itself not does it let anyone else do so. He said the PPP seeks the shelter of democratic slogans, otherwise it is a party of fascism in its core. He also said the PPP spends billions of rupees on advertisements, while on the ground the post-rain situation in the interior areas of the province is an eye-opener for the nation. Similarly, he added, the patchwork on roads in Karachi cost billions of rupees of taxpayers’ money last year, but before the fresh spell of rains, not even a single road was in shape. Naeem said the water corporation has to pay liabilities worth billions of dollars to international monetary institutions. He asked where exactly does the water corporation send the hefty amounts. He said the JI has been playing its due role, and in accordance with its promises, the party has been serving the people of Karachi beyond even its mandate and its capacity. On the electricity supply and load-shedding issues of Karachi, he lamented that K-Electric has ruined the city, which was once the City of Lights. He claimed that KE has emerged as the worst face of privatisation. Over the past 19 years the company’s power generation has reduced by a staggering 20 per cent, he said, adding that KE is on the top in the country when it comes to line losses. Naeem said KE’s power generation plants are dilapidating, adding that the company is imposing itself on Karachiites with the help of corruption and a lunatic nexus of KE, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority and the government."

  "content": " Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Sher Afzal Khan Marwat has said that he has always condemned the acts of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who was recently detained by military over allegations of abuse of power and violating Army Act. \"Being a lawyer, I cannot approve of Gen Faiz's acts as spy chief such as victimising political opponents, harassing them, lodging cases against them..,\" he said while talking on Geo News' programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath' on Monday. Marwat said this in response to a question if he still holds the same opinion which he expressed in the same programme on February 15, stressing that he has the same opinion about the former spy chief. The PTI leader noted that Faiz's malpractices were blamed on the former ruling party. However, the PTI did not benefit from him, he asserted, adding that he [Faiz] had caused more harm to the PTI than any good to the party. Gen (retd) Faiz was taken into custody over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society, the military's media wing had announced adding that a process of Field General Court Martial was also initiated against the retired general. A day later, three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Faiz's arrest, according to the army’s media wing. Speaking about the terrorism, Marwat criticised the decision to bring back the TTP militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saying the decision caused instability in the province. The entire province is bearing the brunt of this policy as his native area is also grappling with militancy, he said. \"They [the TTP militants] should have been properly rehabilitated. Instead, they were left unattended. Now, they have taken up firearms,\" he said, adding that the KP people are facing the repercussions as 70% of the province is facing lawlessness. Responding to a query regarding the August 22 rally, the PTI leader said that the rally would take place as planned despite all government tactics to stop the party from staging the gathering. Responding to a query regarding the PTI's on the same programme, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that he believed that the party would not be allowed to hold this rally, given their record.  The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) activists staged a sit-in peacefully, he said, adding however, none of the PTI rallies have been peaceful. The religio-political party's protest remained within the limits of Rawalpindi as they were not allowed to enter the federal capital."

  "description": "At least 28 Pakistani pilgrims died and another 23 were injured in a bus accident last night in Iran’s Yazd city, Pakistan’s envoy to Tehran said on Wednesday. “In pursuit of their religious journey, 28 Pakistani zaireen laid down their lives last night in Yazd city in bus accident. Another 23 are injured,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu said in a post on X. “I have no words to express grief but I can assure [you] that I will do my very best for repatriation of those who passed away […] and look after the injured ones,” Tipu added.     According to Tipu, embassy officials had already left in the morning for Yazd, which he said was almost 700 kilometres away from Pakistan’s embassy in Tehran. “An officer in Zahedan is overseeing emergency arrangements,” the ambassador said, adding he was in contact with the Iranian government and the office of Yazd’s mayor for “crucial arrangements”. “We thank Iran for extending excellent cooperation. We kindly request your support and patience in this hour of grief,” Tipu said. Meanwhile, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also confirmed the deaths of 28 Pakistanis in the accident, saying he was “extremely dejected to hear about the sad news”.     “I extend my heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Pakistan especially those families who lost loved ones. I wish for the safe and speedy recovery of the injured,” Moghadam said in a post on X. He said he was in “constant contact with the relevant authorities in Iran” and had “insisted for the speedy supply of the necessary services to the injured, including healthcare” as well as the return of the bodies to Pakistan. Pakistan’s Embassy in Iran also shared contact details of relevant officials who could be approached for further information about the accident:  Ahmad Shami: +92 3134556593 (WhatsApp) Aftab Butt: +92 3004166896 Siddique: +98 9046145412          According to Iran’s Mehr Agency, the bus overturned at the Dehshir-Taftan checkpoint in Yazd on Tuesday night and then caught fire. “Of the 23 injured, six have already been discharged from hospital, while the condition of seven others is critical,” AFP quoted Yazd province crisis management chief Ali Malekzadeh as telling Iranian media. “The dead consisted of 11 women and 17 men,” he added. The Pakistani pilgrims were headed through Iran to Iraq to attend the Arbaeen commemoration, one of the biggest occasions for Shia Muslims, which marks the 40th day of mourning for Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan reported that at least 35 Pakistani pilgrims died and another 15 were injured in the accident. Quoting initial reports, Radio Pakistan said that the accident occurred due to the failure of brakes. The injured were taken to hospitals in Yazd, the report said, adding that most of the passengers belonged to Larkana, Ghotki and other cities of Sindh. Condolences Expressing his grief over the accident, President Asif Ali Zardari directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to repatriate the dead and provide timely aid to the injured. “The President expressed his regret over the loss of precious lives,” said a statement issued by his party, the PPP, on social media platform X. He further prayed for the deceased.         Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on X he was “deeply saddened by the loss of lives”. Praying for the bereaved families and for the speedy recovery of the injured, PM Shehbaz said he has directed Pakistan’s Mission in Tehran to extend all possible assistance to the affected families.     Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was gravely concerned for the welfare of those injured in the accident, and expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.         “I have given instructions to our Ambassador in Tehran to ascertain exact situation and provide swift medical relief and recovery services as well as arrange repatriation of dead bodies to Pakistan,” he said in a statement on X. “Our embassy is in constant touch with authorities in Yazd city. We thank the Iranian Government for their assistance and help.” “We express our sincere sympathy to the neighbouring and brotherly government of Pakistan and the bereaved families. Relevant authorities in Iran are actively pursuing relief and treatment services,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani posted on X.         Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister of Sindh, from where most of the pilgrims reportedly hailed, expressed regret over the loss of life in the accident, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson. The Sindh CM directed provincial minister Nasir Shah to facilitate the affected families in Iran, and to also contact the Iran Consul General in Karachi. CM Murad further instructed Shah to get in touch with the foreign ministry to repatriate the bodies as soon as possible. “Travel facilities should be arranged for the pilgrims’ return,” the CM was quoted as saying. He also directed that the best medical facilities be provided to the injured. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also expressed her condolences to the families of the victims and injured. “May they find strength in this difficult time of bereavement,” she said in a statement on X.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The capital police have registered a case against over 6,000 protesters who, under the banner of Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz-i-Nabuwat, entered the Red Zone on Sunday. The case has been registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and different sections of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the Secretariat police station in response to a complaint lodged by a police official. The FIR was registered under section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism), 11-W (printing, publishing or disseminating any material to incite hatred or giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed organisation or an organisation placed under observation or anyone concerned in terrorism) and 11-X (responsibility for creating civil commotion) of ATA, along with sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) besides section 2/3 of Amplifier Act. Seven persons were nominated in the FIR with their names while 5,000 to 6,000 were unidentified.  Case registered under ATA and different sections of PPC at Secretariat police station  According to the FIR, police deployment was made at the D-Chowk entry point. “At around 3:35pm, miscreants coming from three sides under the leadership of Qazi Abdul Rasheed started assembling at Express Chowk. They were about 5,000 to 6,000 and armed with weapons and batons. They set up a stage at Express Chowk besides blocking Ataturk Avenue, Jinnah Avenue and Embassy Road,” the FIR said, adding officials of police and administration warned them that Section 144 had been imposed in the capital. Besides, there was also a ban on staging protests inside the Red Zone under the orders of superior courts. Moreover, the protesters had not taken a no-objection certificate (NOC) and the gathering was illegal, the FIR said. However, they set up a stage and delivered provocative speeches by using a loudspeaker. “Later, they announced to march to Supreme Court with the demand that either the chief justice tender resignation or the government remove him,” the FIR said, adding the speakers also chanted slogans against the government and judiciary. The police tried to intercept them when the protesters started marching towards the SC building. However, they moved forward after attacking the police and damaging the D-Chowk entry gate, cameras, streetlights and police vehicles. They also snatched a number of anti-riot kits from police officials along with a 12-bore gun and beat and injured some of the officials. They also made a police constable hostage and as a result two officials were injured. The police fired teargas shells on the protesters, but they moved forward and also blocked Constitution Avenue. The protesters were stopped at the National Assembly gate from where they dispersed later, the FIR said. Published in Dawn, August 21st, 2024 "

  "description": "   Photo by author  The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority on Wednesday attributed the nationwide slow internet to a “faulty submarine cable” and clarified that no firewalls were being installed, after drawing criticism from both lawmakers and the public. Internet speeds have witnes­sed a considerable decline over the past few weeks, and users are facing difficulties in sending or down­loading media and voice notes through WhatsApp when connected to mobile data, and experiencing slow browsing speeds, even on broadband. The business community and internet service providers (ISPs) had alleged that the government’s efforts to monitor internet traffic — including a so-called ‘firewall’ — had caused the slowdown of digital services, resulting in economic losses. While the country’s information techno­logy minister, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, had confirmed that the government was upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cyber security threats, she has categorically denied rep­orts of the government “throttling” the internet. During a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on IT today, PTA Chairman Retired Major General Hafeezur Rehman faced tough questioning from NA members over widespread complaints about internet slowdowns across the country. “The internet slowdown in the country is due to a faulty submarine cable, which is expected to be repaired by August 28,” Rehman said. He also clarified that it was the government’s web management system — and not a firewall — which was being upgraded. “In my opinion, the internet should not slow down due to an upgrade,” he said. “The telecom [sector] has suffered a loss of [Rs] 300 million.” During the meeting, several senators grilled the PTA chief, expressing frustration over ongoing internet issues. They questioned why TikTok was sometimes shut down, the internet was often slow, and firewalls were intermittently imposed, demanding clarification on the situation. “You have been asked a direct question,” PPP Senator Sharmila Farooqi said to the PTA chief. “Has a firewall been installed or not?” Rehman responded by saying the PTA had no role in the internet slowdown and attributed it to technical issues. “Every country, including Afghanistan, has its own system,” he quipped. MQM’s Senator Mustafa Kamal highlighted that companies have been instructed not to conduct business in Pakistan owing to internet issues. “From your briefing, it seems like there is no issue in Pakistan,” he said to the PTA chief. “So is it really the case that all is well in the country despite all the hue and cry?” PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan questioned the prolonged ban on social media platform X, asking for reasons behind its extended suspension and demanding to know when the ban would be lifted. In response, the PTA chairman admitted that he had no more information on the matter than the committee members did. The committee voiced their opposition to the ban, arguing that such restrictions hinder the country’s progress. They also requested a briefing on  Islamabad and Karachi IT parks. The PTA chairman noted that he hoped the ongoing internet issues would be resolved by August 27, adding that VPNs were not being blocked in the country, nor can they be. “I never stated that VPNs were being restricted,” he said. “The country would experience slow internet for another six days.” Meanwhile, the chairman of the committee, Amin ul Haq, urged the government to ensure that 5G services were available in Pakistan by March. He expressed frustration that despite significant efforts towards the 5G auction, Pakistan still lacked the technology, while other countries were advancing towards 6G. “If 5G cannot be introduced by December, it must be done by March to meet public expectations,” he said.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After receiving immense flak from netizens and information technology sector bodies over intermittent internet disruptions, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) has finally commented on the issue linking it with a \"fault in the undersea submarine cable\". \"Submarine Consortium has informed [us] that the internet [services] are affected due to a fault in the submarine cable which will be resolved by August 27,\" PTA Chairman Major General (retd) Hafeez-Ur-Rehman said while briefing the National Assembly Standing Committee on IT. He added that seven fibre optic cables are connected with Pakistan of which one is damaged.   The PTA chief's remarks come in the wake of the prevailing internet slowdown and limited connectivity that experts and stakeholders have attributed to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media, which is equipped with filters to block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) and IT experts have slammed the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led government over the issue, citing the economic impact on freelancers, IT professionals and the digital economy in general. With P@SHA estimating a loss of $300 million loss in light of existing complaints by the businesses and the reputational damage, WISPAP Chairman Shahzad Arshad has said that businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity which is an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy were now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival”. However, the government has denied its involvement in the issue with State Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja blaming the use of virtual private networks (VPN) by internet users as the reason \"their phones\" slowed down. \"I can swear that the government of Pakistan did not block the internet or slow it down,” she said while speaking to the media last week. During the standing committee's meeting today, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Amin Ul Haq inquired the PTA chairman about the reasons behind internet disruptions. \"The public should be informed why internet service is affected. It should be informed whether a firewall is installed or not?\" the lawmaker asked, adding that the PTA should communicate the matter with the media so that the public is informed. Responding to the query, Gen Rehman referred to IT Minister Khawaja's remarks saying that the reasons behind the prevailing issue were duly addressed in the minister's presser and remarked that the use of VPNs led to the internet being down. Elaborating on the firewall issue, the PTA chief said that the previous web management system (WMS) was renamed and replaced with the firewall technology after its approval in 2019. \"The [internet] firewall system was approved in March 2019,\" he said adding that the upgradation of the system had started the same year. When grilled by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub regarding firewall installation, the PTA chairman said: \"This system was introduced during your regime.\" More to follow..."

  "description": "Two children were killed and five injured when unknown men opened fire at a school van in Attock District’s Dheri Kot area on Thursday, Punjab Rescue 1122 confirmed in a statement. The school van’s driver was the sixth person injured in the incident. The injured as well as the bodies have been shifted to a hospital. While the unidentified gunmen have fled the scene, according to Rescue 1122, the Attock police reached the site of the incident. All children were between 10 and 12 years old, the rescue team added. Regional Police Officer (RPO) Babar Sarfraz Alpa said the incident occurred due to “personal enmity”. “The gunfire was aimed at the driver but also caused harm to the children,” the RPO said. He added that a case had been registered against the suspects and raids were being carried out to arrest them. RPO Sarfraz expressed the hope that the culprits would be arrested soon. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Condemnations pour in President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the incident and said that strict action must be taken against those responsible, according to a statement from the President’s House. “Targeting innocent children is a cruel and shameful act,” the statement read. He prayed for the deceased, as well as for the speedy recovery of the injured children. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said such an attack on children was “quite a cruel and gruesome act”, Radio Pakistan reported. Expressing solidarity with the bereaved families, the premier prayed for the departed souls and early recovery of the injured. He also directed the authorities concerned to take stern action against the culprits and to provide the best treatment facilities to the injured children. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi conveyed his sympathies to the bereaved families, a statement shared by state broadcaster PTV News said.         Praying for the injured children to get well soon, he said that those “targeting innocent children did not deserve to be called human beings”. “The shooting incident on children inside the school van is a monstrosity. Those exhibiting barbarism are not entitled to any concession,” Naqvi asserted. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz sought a report on the incident from Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar, according to a statement issued by her public relations officer. She expressed deep grief over the death of the two students and directed that the best treatment facilities be provided to the injured. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also condemned the attack, calling for the “strictest possible action” against the perpetrators, PTV News reported.         PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said his “heart was crying tears of blood” after hearing about the deaths of the children. “Those with the blood of students on their hands are beasts,” the PPP MNA said in a statement shared by his party on X.         Bilawal said he stood with the bereaved families and prayed for them to have patience. He also expressed the hope that proper treatment of the injured children and the driver would be ensured. While incidents of gun violence targeting children are uncommon in the country, the recent shooting was not an isolated case. Last year, a student was killed and six others as well as a teacher were inj­ured when a cop posted outside a school suddenly opened fire at a van in the Sangota area of Swat. In October 2022, unidentified armed men riding a motorcycle opened fire on a school van in Swat’s Char Bagh area, killing the driver and injuring a child. According to the police, 15 students were inside the vehicle at the time of the attack. On December 16, 2014, 147 students and staff members of the Army Public School (APS) Peshawar were martyred in a gun attack by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants. In 2012, education activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai’s school bus was attacked by the TTP. While Yousafzai was the prime target, other children riding with her in the van had also sustained injuries. "

  "description": "Anchorperson Orya Maqbool Jan was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Lahore on Thursday for posting about the Mubarak Sani case on social media, his lawyer confirmed. Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq said Jan was arrested by the FIA’s cybercrime wing and detained in its Gulberg office, adding that he will be produced before the judicial magistrate today. “The FIA has no authority in this case, we will present strong arguments”, advocate Ashfaq said.  “We are not being told details of the first information report (FIR).” SC hears Mubarak Sani case today The Supreme Court today (Thursday) is hearing the Punjab government’s plea against the court’s July 24 verdict in the Mubarak Sani case. The plea requested the SC to revisit its Feb 6 order, which declared that the right to profess religion and religious freedom, as ensured by the Constitution, is subject to law, morality, and public order. Filed through the prosecutor general of Punjab on Saturday, the application was instantaneously fixed for hearing before a three-judge bench consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. According to the application, some leading clerics and members of parliament have requested the federal government to approach the apex court and highlight some portions of the judgement that merit correction. The three-page application mentions that paragraph 49 needs omission and correction since the July 24 judgement had held that the verdict of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) in the 1985 case of Mujib-ur-Rehman versus the government of Pakistan, and the Supreme Court’s 1993 verdict in Zaheer-ud-Din versus the State case were binding precedents and that the apex court had not deviated from these binding precedents in its Feb 6 judgement. The application explains that some observations and findings contained in some other paragraphs of the judgement appeared to be an accidental error being contrary to the precedents as mentioned by the top court. On Monday, protesters attempted to breach SC security after the Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz-i-Nabuwat arranged a protest demanding the SC withdraw its verdict in the Mubarak Sani case. Police resorted to baton charging and teargas shelling to prevent protesters from reaching Supreme Court. Earlier in the day, protesters had reached Express Chowk in the afternoon and set up a stage on a vehicle with a sound system installed on it to make speeches, police said. A day later, capital police registered a case against over 6,000 protesters for entering the Red Zone. The case was registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the Secretariat police station in response to a complaint lodged by a police official. Seven persons were nominated in the FIR with their names while 5,000 to 6,000 were unidentified. "

  "description": "Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday said that the government remained “very committed” to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)‘s structural reforms amid uncertainty regarding the IMF’s $7 billion bailout schedule. Speculation arose when the country’s name did not show up in the IMF executive board’s schedule for August 28. Previously, the finance minister had anticipated IMF board approval by the last week of August, contingent on confirmation of about $12bn in debt rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. However, aside from a $1bn rollover by the UAE, the remaining $11bn in debt extensions have yet to materialise. The IMF’s executive board is now expected to approve Pakistan’s $7 billion bailout programme in September, while the finance minister has said that the government was in “constant contact with the IMF”. “The fund will help bring further permanence to this macroeconomic stability and under that, we remain very committed,” he said at the inaugural ceremony of the Buna-Raast Connectivity Project today. On the remittances side, the finance minister said that the informal market still captured a “sizable share of the remittances” and that they “must do more”, remembering the administrative measures that were taken previously curb illegal channels in September. “Addressing this challenge is a pre-priority for reducing economic leakages,” he said, adding that “digitalisation is not an end in itself its a means to an end — it brings transparency, it brings client friendliness and it certainly helps reduce leakages in the system.” Leakages, he said, were not just in the context of remittances but also in the tax and power system. “We call it leakages but all of this is ultimately about corruption and people processed technology,” he said.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: More than a month after the Supreme Court handed a major legal victory to the PTI by declaring it eligible for reserved seats in National and provincial assemblies, the party remains without a head and an election symbol in the Election Commission of Pakistan’s books. On Wednesday, the ECP released a revised list of political parties, leaving the position of party head for PTI vacant. The updated list was made public over five weeks after the Supreme Court’s July 12 ruling on reserved seats. Despite the split decision of 8-5, all 13 judges had acknowledged PTI’s status as a parliamentary party. The majority judgement explained that 39 out of the 80 MNAs listed by the ECP as PTI candidates were indeed from that party. However, the remaining 41 independents were required to submit duly signed and notarised statements to the Election Commission within 15 days from the date of the top court’s verdict, confirming that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as candidates of a specific political party. Although the ECP eventually notified the 39 lawmakers, it delayed the process by two weeks before approaching the Supreme Court for clarification on who should be contacted for verification as the PTI had lost its organisational structure. The controversy began when the ECP, after dragging the PTI’s party polls case for a long time, voided its intra-party elections held in 2022 — just before the general elections — and gave the party 20 days to conduct fresh elections, which were also not recognised by the ECP. The commission then denied PTI its iconic poll symbol — bat — forcing candidates to run in the general election as independents. Subsequently, reserved seats were controversially distributed among three other political parties. The Supreme Court has yet to respond to the ECP’s request for clarification — a move many see as an attempt to prevent PTI from emerging as the largest party in the National Assembly. The case against the intra-party elections conducted by PTI after the general elections — its third such exercise in less than two years — also remains pending before the ECP. The revised ECP list now includes 166 registered political parties. The Election Commission has recognised the intra-party elections of several political parties, including the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), without any scrutiny. The commission has confirmed Nawaz Sharif as the PML-N president, while Hafiz Naeemur Rehman is listed as the chief of Jamaat-i-Islami. Interestingly, President Asif Ali Zardari, despite being elected as head of state for a second time, continues to head Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), while Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has been confirmed as chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Former KP chief minister Mehmood Khan has been updated as the chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), a party formed by another former KP chief minister, Pervaiz Khattak, before the general elections. Asfandyar Wali Khan remains the president of the Awami National Party (ANP), and Maulana Fazlur Rahman continues to lead his faction of JUI. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui also retains his position as convener of MQM-Pakistan. The election body has included the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) in the list of registered political parties without mentioning the name of its head. Prominent party leaders in the list include Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain (Pakistan Muslim League), Mehmood Khan Achakzai (Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party), Dr Abdul Hayee Baloch (National Democratic Party), Dr Abdul Malik Baloch (National Party), Shahzain Bugti (Jamhoori Wattan Party), and Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao (Qaumi Watan Party).

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Amid growing skirmishes between two key ruling coalition parties over the issues of Punjab-only power tariff subsidy and the federal government’s policy of downsizing ministries, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the PPP leaders on Thursday (today) for a meeting to sort out differences, Dawn has learnt through sources. “Yes, [PPP] chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has received a formal invitation from the prime minister for a meeting at the PM House [on Thursday] which will be followed by a dinner,” said a source in the PPP on Wednesday. The source said that though it was not clear yet, the PPP delegation was expected to include party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Reh­man, former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and veteran leader Syed Naveed Qamar as the party planned to discuss some future legislative agenda as well. The prime minister is likely to be assisted in the meeting by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah and some other key members of his cabinet.  Premier to host dinner for PPP chief today  Mr Bhutto-Zardari has already arrived in Islamabad. He chaired a meeting of the party’s central Punjab chapter at Zardari House on Wedn­esday which, according to a handout, discussed the political situation and PPP’s organisational matters. The prime minister has called the meeting after the issues of soaring electricity tariffs and rightsizing of ministries as part of austerity measures triggered a war of words between the ruling allies, with the PPP criticising the PML-N-led federal and Punjab governments. The friction escalated on Friday when PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, alongside his daughter Maryam Nawaz, anno­unced a Rs14 per unit relief for those consumers in Punjab who use between 200 and 500 units per month. This announcement was met with disdain from the PPP-led Sindh government and the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Both provinces, apparently lacking resources to offer similar relief, blasted both the federal and Punjab governments. PM Sharif on Tuesday came to the Punjab government’s rescue, saying the Centre had not provided a single penny to the province. During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the PM asked other provinces to follow in Punjab’s footsteps by reallocating their development funds to provide similar relief to electricity consumers. “Instead of politicking, provincial governments should follow Punjab’s course of action to provide relief to their people by utilising funds from trillions of rupees transferred to them under the National Finance Commission awa­rd,” he had reportedly stated. Earlier, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah accused the PML-N of introducing costly power plants decades ago, which, he argued, had led to the high electricity costs. He said Sindh would focus on developing its own coal and solar power plants that the province had been barred from until now. Mr Shah accused the federal government of neglecting Sindh, claiming that many projects requiring federal funds remained stalled. The PPP has expressed serious reservations over the centre’s policy on rightsizing of ministries. Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed, a member of the committee set up to address the issue, had rejected the composition of the committee. He stated that only one PPP member and one private member had been nominated to the body, as most other members were from PML-N. Published in Dawn, August 22nd, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: While Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Wednesday emerged unscathed from an election tribunal hearing a challenge to his victory in the Feb 8 elections, Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove lost his ministry in a separate case after the tribunal ordered re-polling in seven disputed polling stations. The Election Tribunal-1, consisting of Justice Abdullah Baloch of the Balochistan High Court (BHC), suspended Mr Langove’s victory from PB-36 Kalat constituency of the Balochistan Assembly. The tribunal declared Mr Langove’s appointment as minister for home and tribal affairs null and void. It directed that a new returning officer, deputy returning officers and election staff be appointed to conduct re-polling at seven disputed polling stations in the constituency.  Plea challenging CM Bugti’s eligibility to contest election dismissed  The decision was announced on a petition filed by Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s candidate Mir Saeed Ahmad Langove. Akram Shah represented the JUI-F’s candidate while Saleem Lashari appeared on behalf of Ziaullah Langove. The decision announced on Wednesday was reserved after both sides had completed their arguments during the last hearing. Suspending Mir Ziaullah’s victory, the tribunal directed the Ele­ction Commission to de-notify him, and nullified his appointment as a member of the provincial cabinet. In its verdict, the tribunal further ordered that after re-elections at disputed polling stations No. 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, and 92, Form-45 should be prepared for each polling station. It said that after consolidating all Form-45s from the entire constituency, Forms-47 and 49 should be prepared, and the final result be announced in the presence of the candidates or their agents. Plea dismissed In the other case, the Election Tribunal-2 dismissed a petition against CM Bugti filed by Mir Gohram Bugti, who had contested election against him from PB-10 Dera Bugti. Mir Gohram had challenged the CM’s eligibility pleading that the latter was federal caretaker interior minister and quit the post just before the election. The tribunal, headed by Justice Rozi Khan of the BHC, heard the petition. He had reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from both sides on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the tribunal announ­ced the judgement, dismissing the petition and allowing Sarfraz Bugti to continue as chief minister. Advocate General of Balochistan Asif Ali Reki represented the government in the case, while Kamran Murtaza, Jameel Agha and Noor Jahan appeared on behalf of the chief minister. Mir Gohram was represented by Advocate Hassan Maan. Published in Dawn, August 22nd, 2024 "

  "description": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan Army’s Major Sania Safdar, who is serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), became its first peacekeeper to rec­e­ive the 2023 ‘Certificate of Recognition’ for advocating gender equality. The award, issued by the New York-based UN Department for Peace Operations, was presented to her by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Cyprus, Colin Stewart, according to the mission’s statement on Wednesday.         “Receiving this certificate as the first peacekeeper from UNFICYP is deeply meaningful to me and significant for our mission in Cyprus,” Maj Safdar said. “It serves as a testament to our commitment to gender equality.” Created in 2016, the UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award recognises the dedication and efforts of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Council Resolution 1325. Maj Safdar’s primary tasks involve overseeing communication systems and promoting gender equality within military component. Since her deployment last year, she proactively took charge of several initiatives to contribute to achieve this recognition by focusing on integrating women into the mission’s work.

  "description": "• Local administration again cancels NOC issued to PTI for public meeting at Tarnol • Several arrested as party vows to go ahead with its planned Jalsa • Activists of religious groups directed to reach SC ISLAMABAD: The nearly five-month struggle of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) met a similar fate on Wednesday when the capital administration revoked its no-objection certificate (NOC) barely 24 hours before the scheduled public gathering in Tarnol on Thursday (today). PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal, however, said they would go ahead with the public meeting despite cancellation of the NOC. “The administration has canceled the NOC but not the jalsa,” he added. The PTI has been attempting to hold a public meeting in Islamabad since March, but the capital administration has repeatedly used delaying tactics to issue permission. This is for the second time the capital administration has cancelled the NOC issued to PTI for holding public gathering in Tarnol. Earlier, in July, the administration cancelled the NOC issued to PTI to hold the gathering in Tarnol. Following cancellation of the NOC issued by the office of the deputy commissioner on July 31, the Chief Commissioner Office issued an order stating that a meeting of the Federal Capital Intelligence Coordination Committee was held under the chairmanship of the chief commissioner on Wednesday to consider and resolve the growing concerns regarding law and order situation prevailing in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by the inspector general of Islamabad police (IGP), deputy commissioner and senior officers from the Chief Commissioner’s Office, capital police as well as representatives from the ISI, MI and IB, the order added. The committee also deliberated on the matter of a political public meeting organised by the PTI scheduled to be held at Tarnol on Aug 22, for which an NOC had been issued by the deputy commissioner. When assessment of institutional capacity of the capital police was sought, the IGP stressed that with the available resources, it would be difficult for the police to maintain security as multiple events were simultaneously taking place in Islamabad, it said. The order said the police chief mentioned that a call for protest had also been given by Tehreek-i-Khatam-i-Nabuwat for Thursday in front of the Supreme Court when the review petition in Mubarak Ahmed Sani case would be taken up. Different political parties and groups would be participating in the protest. The IGP also highlighted the recent breach of security in Red Zone whereby an FIR had also been registered against the protesters, the order said, adding that furthermore, the Bangladesh cricket team was in Islamabad which also required enhanced security of the players. The IGP further informed the meeting that it was expected that people coming to join the rally planned to stay over a prolonged period as they had brought with them items such as teargas masks, bedding or sleeping bags as well as food items, the order said, adding that it was expected that the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement and Sunni Tehreek would also join the PTI’s protest. The order mentioned that the IGP had suggested to the chief commissioner that other provinces, particularly Punjab, should be instructed to prevent participants from entering Islamabad and no gatherings should be allowed under the current situation. The Special Branch representative also endorsed these concerns, and reiterated that under the prevailing law and order situation, it was unsafe to issue an NOC for the PTI rally. Furthermore, the representatives of ISI, MI and IB expressed security concerns, citing the law and order situation, threat alerts, the presence of the Bangladesh cricket team and recent disturbances caused by Khatam-i-Nabuwat rallies in the Red Zone. Considering the opinions of the law enforcement agencies, and after reviewing the situation, the chief commissioner reached the conclusion that the current law and order situation in Islamabad did not permit holding of such a gathering in Islamabad on Aug 22 which necessitated the cancellation of the NOC granted by the deputy commissioner on July 31. “Therefore, having concluded the matter through the instant order announced in presence of all concerned, I, Mohammad Ali Randhawa, Chief Commissioner ICT deem it expedient in the public interest to suspend the NOC issued on July 31 by the Deputy Commissioner, with immediate effect and till further orders,” the order concluded. After cancellation of the NOC, police contingents also reached the venue of the public gathering at Tarnol Chowk and picked up over two dozen people present there, including those who were engaged in preparations, police sources said, adding that a suspicious bag was also found from a mosque adjacent to the venue. The bag was unclaimed and during inquiry it was revealed that it was lying inside the mosque since morning, they said, adding that the mosque was vacated and bomb disposal squad was called. A man was also taken into custody from the spot and shifted to an undisclosed location, they added. Meanwhile, the capital police arranged over 400 containers to seal the capital including Red Zone’s entry points except one from Margalla Road. Besides, containers were placed along the roadside at Faizabad, Chungi No 26, Rawat and Bhara Kahu, police sources said, adding that the containers would be put in place to seal the capital sometime after midnight or early Thursday morning.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday ordered the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to take possession of restaurants, namely Monal, La Montana and Gloria Jeans, situated inside the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). The Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Islamabad Capital Territory police have also been obligated to assist the wildlife board in this regard. Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a three-judge Supreme Court ordered that the entrances to the area will also be barricaded after which the infrastructure will be demolished with minimal disturbance to the wildlife and avoiding damage to the trees of the national park. The debris will be removed and disposed of properly and not within the precincts of MHNP, said a 25-page order issued on Wednesday on an appeal against the Jan 11, 2022, Islamabad High Court (IHC) judgement of sealing and taking over the possession of the restaurants, including the most frequented eatery – Monal – perched atop picturesque Margalla Hills. The judgement came after the last hearing held on June 11, in which the apex court had ordered the relocation of restaurants out of the national park area within a period of three months.  Order says area to be barricaded after which infrastructure will be demolished  Authored by CJP Faez Isa, the order also gave a roadmap by stating that after taking possession, the wildlife board would determine how best to utilise the mountain ridge on which these restaurants stood. The board may consult experts and environmentalists to examine whether the foundations of these structures should also be removed or the same be left in and used to make an artificial lake to collect rainwater which can be used to put out fires that erupt in the national park area. The order was clear when it said under no circumstances should the building be left abandoned or derelict nor leave any debris on the site. Every effort should be made to ensure the land becomes an integral part of the national park again. The national park’s land is under grave and imminent danger, the judgement said, adding that the rich, powerful and well-connected wanted to wrest it away for their personal use or gain. The priciest land in Islamabad, the judgement regretted, was the land facing the Margalla Hills; prices start reducing the further one moves away from this natural wonder. Resultantly, every profiteer has set his eyes on this unbuilt real estate which probably is the most expensive land in Pakistan. The park’s land has over the years been encroached upon, which could only have happened with the involvement of the officers of the CDA and other senior bureaucrats, the judgement regretted. The CJP regretted that the government servants who collude with land grabbers needed reminding that it was the people who pay their salaries and it was them who they serve and whose interest they must protect. Those who forget this fundamental truth are a drain on the public exchequer, the verdict explained, adding that the private interests and those marauding public lands must not be allowed to deprive the people of Pakistan and future generations of it. If we lose the national park the adverse effects of greenhouse gases, deforestation, soil erosion, pollution and climate change will be exacerbated to the detriment of the people and future generations, the judgement explained. The fundamental right to life, and to live it with dignity (respectively Article 9 and 14 of the Constitution) is to live in a world which has an abundance of all species. It has by now been scientifically well established that if Earth becomes bereft of birds, animals, insects, trees, plants, clean rivers, unpolluted air, and soil it will be the precursor of our destruction, and scientific research establishes that nothing in nature is without value and purpose, the judgement said. Last week, the Supreme Court issued a contempt notice to the Monal owner. The court took exception to a campaign launched against the court allegedly at the behest of the owner of Monal that the decision of relocating the eatery may render a number of employees jobless. “Prima facie, the smear campaign against the judiciary amounts to contempt of court,” the court observed while dictating an order regarding the issuance of the contempt notice.

  "description": "QUETTA: The Director General of the Levies Force Balochistan has dismissed four Levies personnel, including SHO of Levies Khadkocha Thana for committing negligence in performing duty, following an investigation into the killing of Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Zakir Baloch. According to an official notification issued by the Balochistan Levies DG, the dismissed personnel include SHO Khadkocha Thana Owais Khan and three patrolling Levies men — Ejaz Ahmed, Shoaib Ahmed, and Abdul Zahir. The notification said that these Levies officials were found to be inefficient and failed to maintain general law and order. On the evening of Aug 12, a group of armed men set up a checkpoint and began snap-checking at Bidrang in the Khadkocha area of Mastung. It was set up before Panjgur DC Zakir Baloch along with Municipal Committee Chairman Abdul Malik Baloch and others were about to pass through the area. Sensing the situation, his driver attempted to turn the vehicle around and escape, but the armed men opened an indiscriminate fire. As a result of the firing, both municipal committee chairman and Panjgur DC were injured. They were later shifted to a hospital in Mastung where Zakir Baloch died during treatment. Despite a checkpoint being just one kilometer away and a Levies station three kilometers away, the officials did not respond effectively or arrive at the scene, showing negligence. Taking serious notice of the incident, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti had earlier instructed the additional chief secretary (home) to conduct an immediate investigation to identify those responsible and recommend appropriate punishment. The additional chief secretary and DG Levies then directed DC Kalat to investigate the matter and submit a report. The preliminary inquiry report found the SHO of the nearby Levies station and three others guilty of negligence. Based on the inquiry report, the DG Levies dismissed the four personnel, including the SHO, though the list of those under investigation remains extensive. Published in Dawn, August 22nd, 2024 "

  "description": "• PTA chief blames disruptions on faulty submarine cable; expects issue to be fixed in a week • Dismisses claims about installation of firewall; says govt upgrading ‘web management system’ • PTA files reply in LHC ISLAMABAD: Giving yet another justification for the disruption of internet services in the country, the government on Wednesday blamed a nationwide internet slowdown on a faulty submarine cable, dismissing allegations that it had installed a firewall that was behind the slowdown. The explanation came amid mo­­u­nting criticism from lawmakers over declining internet speeds during a session of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication. During the meeting, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman Hafeezur Rehman faced tough questions from lawmakers about widespread internet issues. Mr Rehman, a retired major general, attributed the slowdown to a damaged submarine cable, which he said would be repaired by Aug 27. He reiterated that the government was merely upgrading its “web management system”, dismissing fears that the state was installing a firewall. Over the past few weeks, internet users across the country have reported significant drops in speed, struggling to send or download media and make phone calls on platforms like WhatsApp and experiencing slow browsing even on broadband connections. The business community and inte­rnet service providers (ISPs) have accused the government of intentionally slowing down digital services through the installation of a “firewall”, leading to economic losses. The controversy intensified when Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja initially confirmed that the government was upgrading its “web management system” to address cybersecurity thre­a­­ts. However, two days later, she den­ied any intentional throttling of the internet, fuelling speculation and concern. On Wednesday, several senators frustrated by the ongoing issues pressed the PTA chief for more clarity. They questioned the intermittent shutdowns of platforms like TikTok, the slow internet speeds, and the alleged use of firewalls. Sharmila Farooqi of the PPP directly asked the PTA chairman whether a firewall had been installed, to which he responded that the telecom authority had no role in the slowdown and deflected the issue by blaming technical problems. MQM-Pakistan Senator Mustafa Kamal criticised the PTA’s handling of the situation, pointing out that businesses were being discouraged from operating in Pakistan due to unreliable internet services. PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan raised concerns about the prolonged ban on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), demanding to know when the suspension would be lifted. Mr Rehman admitted that he had no additional information on the matter, further frustrating the committee members. The PTA chairman hoped that the internet issues would be resolved within a week and clarified that VPNs were not being blocked, contrary to some reports. “I never stated that VPNs were being restricted,” he said, adding that the country would experience slow internet for another six days. Committee Chairman Aminul Haque urged the government to ensure the availability of 5G services in the country by March. “If 5G cannot be introduced by December, it must be done by March to meet public expectations,” Mr Haque stressed. Later, speaking to Independent Urdu, the PTA chairman explained the reasons for upgrading the web management system. He said upg­ra­des to social media blocking in light of government or court orders were nothing new in Pakistan. “The web management system (WMS) has been in place for a long time,” he said. The PTA chairman also clarified that the system had been commissioned in the 1990s, with its most recent upgrade approved in March 2019. “Upgrading the system is a matter of routine,” he noted. PTA files response in LHC On Wednesday, the PTA also info­rmed the Lahore High Court that a fault in the submarine cable affected the internet speed in the country and that repairs on the underwater internet cable were ongoing. PTA’s lawyer Chaudhry Umar filed a written response in the court explaining that the internet service was affected due to a fault in the submarine cable. He indicated that the fault would likely be fixed by Aug 28. The lawyer also presented a 2009 policy decision of the federal government authorising the PTA to close the telecommunication services in the country due to national security concerns. The judge adjourned the hearing till Aug 27, granting more time to the federal government and other auth­o­rities to submit their detailed replies. The petitions against the internet slowdown were filed by lawyers Azhar Siddique and Nadeem Sarwar. The judge also instructed the petitioners to submit the specific dates of the internet disruption. Wajih Ahmad Sheikh in Lahore also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, August 22nd, 2024 "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) postponed its public meeting in Islamabad on Thursday and rescheduled it for September 8 following the city administration’s rescinding its no objection certificate and closing the roads leading to the federal capital. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan announced that the rally had been postponed and would now take place on September 8 in accordance with PTI founder Imran Khan's directive. \"After meeting with the PTI founder in Adiala jail, we decided to postpone the jalsa,\" he stated. PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub also confirmed date for the rally was changed on the instruction of Imran. “We have received information that the government is conspiring to spread anarchy, under the cover of the jalsa,” he maintained. Upon the opposition party’s announcement of a new date for the rally, the Islamabad administration issued a notification granting it permission in this regard. The notification containing 40 instructions is issued by the district magistrate of the federal capital. “The Islamabad administration revoked the NOC due to protests of the religious parties. The administration would provide security for the September 8 gathering,” it said. However, the notification warned that fundamental rights of the citizens should not be violated by the participants of the rally. People should gather at 4pm and the event should be concluded by 7pm. “It will be the jalsa organiser’s duty to disperse the party workers at the end of the rally. The workers will not be allowed to stay at the rally site on September 8,” it said. The notification reemphasised that the permission is granted for public gathering and not for a sit-in. “No object of lethal or non-lethal force including batons of any size would be wielded by any participant of the gathering nor any participant shall indulge in violence or clashes. In case of any such incidence of clashes/ violence the organisers shall be held responsible. “Organisers are bound to ensure that the participants do not spend the night or subsequent nights there and are dispersed peacefully,” it maintained. After the PTI earlier vowed to hold a protest in Islamabad despite the revocation of the NOC for the event, the police sealed multiple key arteries, particularly entry and exit points of the federal capital city. Police sealed major thoroughfares leading to Islamabad through Faizabad, the Double Road and Chongi No 26 bus stop as well, leaving the people stuck in traffic as long queues of vehicles are formed due to the road closure. Metro Bus service has also been suspended in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, while a heavy contingent of police has been deployed on the alternative routes for the public’s facilitation and security. Additionally, security was put on high alert, while red zone areas as well as entry and exit points of the federal capital had been sealed. D-Chowk, too, has been closed by placing containers. Only Margalla Avenue is open from one side for entry into the red zone but the avenue is closed from the GT Road. Several other arteries are also choked with traffic as the district administrations of the twin cities placed containers on them, including Motorway M-2 (Islamabad Lane) as Kalarkahar, Balaksar and Nela interchanges are blocked. Containers have been placed near Sawan on GT Road, near T-Chowk in Rawat, near Carriage Factory and motorway from Islamabad Link has also been closed. This may take a significant amount of time to resume normal flow of the vehicular traffic even after the PTI’s announcement to defer the public meeting as scores of heavy containers would have to be moved away, after clearing the roads of traffic. Meanwhile, the Islamabad district administration has already announced to keep all the public and private educational institutions closed on Thursday. On the other hand, the district administration has imposed Section 144 till August 24 in Rawalpindi, banning public gatherings, demonstrations, and sit-ins. The administration had annulled the NOC issued to the PTI for the rally. In a statement on Wednesday, PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said that the district administration had cancelled the notification, but “we haven’t cancelled the jalsa”. “A peaceful political struggle is our constitutional and legal right,” he said. The district administration revoked the NOC granted to PTI on the “report of district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa. The session also reviewed the NOC, granted by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad. During the meeting, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ali Nasir Rizvi pointed out the security concerns due to multiple events. Citing strict security concerns, the administration noted that the Bangladesh cricket team is in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a rally. “A few days ago, some protesters also reached the Supreme Court building,” it said, adding that in such circumstances, permission to hold public rallies cannot be given. Imran, who was removed as prime minister via a parliamentary vote in 2022, had \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22 following a prolonged struggle to hold a power show in Islamabad. Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif had said that the party would not try to violate the law on their part but vowed to hold the rally come what may."

  "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday issued its detailed verdict in the Margalla Hills restaurant case directing the authorities to demolish the eateries which are to be taken over by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board. The 25-page order written by  Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa says: \"On 11 September 2024, the Wildlife Board will take over the possession of the said restaurants with the full assistance of CDA and the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, and the entrances to said area shall be barricaded.\" The detailed verdict follows the court's June 11 ruling wherein it had directed the closure of Monal Restaurant along with other eateries located in the Margalla Hills National Park (MHPN). The order of the three-member bench, comprising the CJP, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, came in response to in response to a March 11 court order in which it had sought the complete record of the land ownership of the restaurant. The court had then also directed all other restaurants in the National Park including Monal to relocate within the three-month period.  In its remarks, the SC said that its aim is to ensure the protection of the National Park. It added that apart from National Park, the unnecessary notices issued to all other restaurants are terminated. Stressing that it was only focusing on the National Park, the court said: \"All the leases granted to restaurants located in National Park are declared null and void.\" In his detailed judgement today which upheld the Islamabad High Court's then-judge Athar Minallah's ruling, CJP Isa said that the restaurants were to be demolished with minimal disturbance to the wildlife and by avoiding damage to the trees of the National Park. The top court's order also states that the Wildlife Board will determine how best to utilise the mountain ridge where the eateries were located and it may consult experts and environmentalists to examine whether the foundations of the said structures should also be removed or the same be left in and used to make an artificial lake to collect rainwater which can be used to put out fires that erupt in the National Park.  \"Under no circumstances should the building be left abandoned/derelict nor leave any debris on the said site. Every effort should be made to ensure that the said land again becomes an integral part of the National Park,\" said the verdict. Furthermore, directing the defence secretary to ensure the enforcement of existing laws, the SC has also ordered the CDA chairman to provide guidance to the ministry in this regard. Additionally, the Ministry of Climate Change secretary and Environmental Protection director general have been ordered to conduct a survey of buildings in the area. The order also calls for an assessment of environmental damage and measures that are necessary to prevent further environmental degradation."

  "content": "ATTOCK: At least two children died and five were injured after gunmen attacked their school van in Attock's Dheri Kot village on Wednesday, Geo News reported citing rescue officials. According to Rescue 1122 officials, the children injured in the attack were aged between five to 12 years old. They have been shifted to the hospital, they said. The children killed in the attack included a nine-year-old and a 10-year-old, while the five injured included two eight-year-olds, one was seven, one one was 12 and one child is four years old. In the wake of the attack, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has sought a report from Rawalpindi Commissioner Abdul Aamer Khattak. The chief minister has also expressed deep sorrow over the death of the two children in the attack. CM Maryam also directed relevant authorities to provide the best treatment facilities to the children who have sustained injuries. Attock Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza, in conversation with Geo News, said that the gun attack on the school van was a result of the driver’s personal enmity. He added that a forest official and his friend were killed due to this enmity last month and the van driver was attacked to avenge the murder. The DC explained that the driver was injured in the attack, but the children were also attacked. According to the DC, two girls —seated in the passenger seat with the driver — were killed in the attack, while the driver himself is injured. He added that the police and administration are busy in search operation. President Asif Ali Zardari has condemned the \"cruel\" attack on children in Attock. In a statement, the president said targeting innocent children is a very cruel and shameful act, directing authorities to take strict action against those responsible. Condemning the unfortunate incident, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the attack on innocent children is extremely \"cruel and barbaric\". He has directed the authorities to take strict action against those responsible. Punjab Governor Saleem Haider Khan has also strongly condemned the targeting of the school van, expressing deep sorrow over the tragic deaths of the minors. Describing the attack as \"heartbreaking\", the governor ordered authorities to swiftly investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice."

  "content": "The Islamabad district administration has decided to keep all the public and private educational institutions closed on Thursday. The capital administration made the decision in view of a scheduled jalsa of the former ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and a protest call by a religious party. The PTI has announced holding jalsa in the federal capital today (Thursday) despite the revocation of the non-objection certificate (NOC) that was granted earlier to the Imran Khan-founded party. In a statement, the interior ministry said that the decision was taken to ensure the safety of the students in the federal capital. In a statement on Wednesday, PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said that the district administration had cancelled the notification, but “we haven’t cancelled the jalsa”. “A peaceful political struggle is our constitutional and legal right.” The district administration revoked the NOC granted to PTI on the “report of district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa. The session also reviewed the NOC, granted by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad. During the meeting, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ali Nasir Rizvi pointed out the security concerns due to multiple events. Citing strict security concerns, the administration noted that the Bangladesh cricket team is in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a jalsa. “A few days ago, some protesters also reached the Supreme Court building,” it said, adding that in such circumstances, permission to hold public rallies cannot be given. Imran Khan, who was removed as prime minister via a parliamentary vote in 2022, had \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22 following a prolonged struggle to hold a power show in Islamabad."

  "content": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday hinted at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan's \"open trial\" in military court after the latter demanded the same for ex-Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hamid earlier today. The defence minister's statement came hours after the former premier called for an open trial of General (retd) Faiz who was taken into custody by the military over alleged abuse of power and the Army Act violation earlier this month. \"We don't have any precedent that any general's military trial held in an open court in the country's history,\" said Asif while speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath'. \"If the PTI founder faces any trial in a military court, then I can assure you that it would be open to the public and media because he is a civilian.\" He further clarified that it is the military's tradition not to conduct open trials of its employees and officers. Accusing the former ruling party of working in collusion with the detained former spy chief, Asif said that the last year's May 9 violent protests triggered by Khan's arrest and saw attacks on state properties including military installations were pre-planned. He further alleged that the PTI founder provided the manpower for the May 9 riots while the former top spy \"masterminded the conspiracy\".  When questioned about the deposed prime minister's statements denying any connections with the former ISI chief, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader claimed that not only Khan, PTI's second-tier leadership had openly admitted to being in contact with Gen (retd) Faiz even after May 9, 2023, riots. During an informal interaction with journalists in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail earlier today, the former prime minister, who was removed from office via a parliamentary vote in 2022, said the open trial of ex-ISI chief would benefit the country and allow it to prosper. Responding to Khan’s statement, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar termed the ex-prime minister’s statement an intervention in the army’s affairs. Taking a swipe at the former PM, the information said the PTI founder was continuously trying to make the matter related to the army’s internal accountability process “controversial” through his statements. Following the former spymaster's arrest, the ex-premier had distanced himself from the retired general, who served as DG ISI during his tenure, claiming that he has no connection with him. \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had announced the arrest of the former ISI chief on August 12, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said. The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, it added. Three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Hamid’s arrest in connection with the same housing scheme case. Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank. The two retired brigadiers were identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster."

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday pointed out the demolition of Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s statues during recent protests, saying that the individual who led the movement against Pakistan was now facing consequences. \"What goes around comes around\", the premier said while addressing the National Youth Convention in Islamabad.  Infuriated people vandalised several statues, pictures and murals of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman following an end to Sheikh Hasina-led government who fled to India on board a military helicopter along with her sister. The Hasina government collapsed on the back of riots — one of the worst in the country's history of 50-odd years. Almost 300 people were killed and thousands of others injured in the recent violence that started in early July. The protesters launched their rallies last month, demanding the government abolish civil service job quotas. However, the large-scale demonstrations escalated into the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule, with protesters later calling on the 76-year-old to step down. Speaking about other domestic matters, PM Shehbaz said that Pakistan had sacrificed thousands of lives in its fight against terrorism besides suffering an economic loss of $150 billion. \"Not just Pakistan, the whole world has benefited from the elimination of terrorism by Pakistan,\" he added. The convention was attended by federal ministers, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir, Chairman of the Higher Education Commission, teachers, vice-chancellors and students from across the country. Calling the 1973 Constitution a binding force for the nation, he said Pakistani nation also showed unity when the country carried out the nuclear tests in 1998 to make its defence impregnable, setting aside the serious challenges. He said that besides the common citizens, the security forces played their fullest role in purging the country of terrorism, which the nation would always remember. Coming to the economic challenges, the prime minister said the government was compelled to privatise the Pakistan International Airline (PIA) which once used to be a model for other airlines in the region. \"Similarly, South Korea copied Pakistan’s five-year development plan and boosted its economy while Pakistan still lagged behind\". \"We have to decide whether the business will go as usual or we will move forward,\" he remarked. He assured that despite the challenges of electricity, revenue receipts and exports, the government would dole out maximum funds for youth empowerment and recalled the PML-government’s pro-youth steps in the past including the merit-based distribution of laptops, establishment of Punjab Education Endowment Fund to distribute scholarships worth Rs22 billion, and numerous schemes for skill development. He further said that youth empowerment and the united efforts by the politicians and the national institutions were inevitable to put the country on the course to progress. The premier said it was the government’s responsibility to equip the youth with modern education, technology and skills to enable them to change the country’s fate and bring about a “revolution” of progress and prosperity. PM Shehbaz said the country’s youth had immense potential as for the last three years, Pakistani students were among the top achievers of the foreign scholarships. Urging the youth to go into the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been asked to instruct the commercial banks to allocate 40% of their loans for the sector. He also referred to the federal government’s Rs50 billion relief package for electricity consumers using up to 200 units for a three-month period. He said the Punjab government has also announced a Rs45 billion package to give Rs14 per unit subsidy to the consumers using 200-500 units which should also be copied by other provinces, instead of politicking on the matter. \"If we resolve to change Pakistan, it will not be too far when the country will emerge as a great nation. Today’s Pakistan and its prevailing circumstances necessitate politicians and national institutions to serve the country unitedly while observing their constitutional limits. If we do so, history will remember us forever otherwise the future generations will never forgive us,\" he added."

  "content": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on Wednesday addressed the National Youth Convention in Islamabad and reiterated Pakistan's commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism. \"Pakistan's future is in safe hands,\" said the army chief while addressing the Islamabad event, adding that a strong bond between the nation, the government and the army guarantees the prosperity of the country. It is the state's responsibility to protect the nation from the adverse effects of social media, he added. Gen Munir also said that those people who built a narrative of Pakistan's default were found nowhere today.   \"One should ask the importance of an independent state from the people of Libya, Syria, Kashmir, and Gaza,\" he said. Urging the nation not to lose hope for a good future, the COAS said that they were forbidden to despair as Muslims. He went on the say that youth is the most important and expensive asset of Pakistan and they would not let anyone waste it at any cost. Gen Munir reiterated that it Is his firm belief that the country would defeat terrorism. He added that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) people have been standing alongside the Pakistan Army against the menace of terrorism for the last 22 years. He asked the tribes to help the state in resolving disputes through dialogues. The army chief's statement came after the federal government launched a new anti-terrorism operation, Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability), citing a rise in terrorist attacks across the country. Regarding the new counterterrorism drive, the military's media wing said last month that it aimed at harnessing the national counter-terrorism efforts in a synchronised manner to dismantle the nexus of terrorism and illegal spectrum in the country for enduring stability and economic prosperity. The Pakistan Army also categorically rejected criticism against the new anti-terror drive, vowing to combat \"digital terrorism\" conspirators abetted by foreign cohorts sowing discord through the peddling of fake news and propaganda. The institution also clarified that the new anti-terror drive would not be a large-scale military operation."

  "content": "UNITED NATIONS: The Pakistan Army’s Major Sania Safdar, who is serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), has become its first peacekeeper to receive the 2023 \"Certificate of Recognition\" for advocating gender equality, according to the mission. The award, issued by the New York-based UN Department for Peace Operations, was presented to her by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in Cyprus, Colin Stewart. \"Receiving this certificate as the first peacekeeper from UNFICYP is deeply meaningful to me and significant for our mission in Cyprus,\" Maj Safdar said. \"It serves as a testament to our commitment to gender equality.\" Created in 2016, the UN's \"Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award\" recognises the dedication and efforts of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS). In addition to the award, the Department for Peace Operations also recognises military personnel from other UN Missions who are contributing to advancing the WPS' agenda in different countries where peacekeeping operations are in place. In Cyprus, Major Safdar is currently serving as the Mission's Force Signal Officer and one of the UNFICYP's military gender focal points. Her primary tasks involve overseeing communication systems and promoting gender equality within the military component. Since her deployment last year, she proactively took charge of several initiatives to contribute to achieving this recognition by focusing on integrating the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda into military components of the mission's work, the mission said. As the mission's force signal officer serving in the field technology section, she was also involved in strengthening the effectiveness of joint patrols by incorporating communication tools to enhance military operations on the ground while promoting gender representation in the military. Participation of women in peacekeeping missions brings diverse perspectives and skills that enhance operational effectiveness and foster inclusive approaches to conflict resolution, according to the mission. Their meaningful participation promotes gender equality within operations, contributing to more comprehensive and sustainable peace efforts. \"UNFICYP is on a steady curve to increase its statistics on the number of women in peacekeeping as well as promoting their participation while engaging with Member States to encourage further representation of uniformed women as critical actors in fulfilling the Mission's mandate.\" Major Safdar's recognition award serves as a \"testament to UNFICYP's commitment to gender equality\", it added."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has pledged to hold jalsa in the federal capital tomorrow (Thursday) after the district administration revoked a non-objection certificate (NOC) over \"security concerns\".  “The district administration has revoked the notification, but we will still go ahead with the jalsa,” PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said in a video statement, adding that a peaceful political struggle is their ‘constitutional and legal right’.  According to an official statement issued by the local authorities, the district administration revoked the NOC — earlier granted to PTI by Deputy Commissioner — on the “report of district intelligence committee.”  The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa.  During the meeting, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ali Nasir Rizvi pointed out the security concerns due to multiple events. Citing strict security concerns, the administration noted that the Bangladesh cricket team is in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a jalsa. “A few days ago, some protesters also reached the Supreme Court building,” it said, adding that in such circumstances, permission to hold public rallies cannot be given. The development came a day before the public rally was scheduled, as announced by Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif. Imran Khan, who was removed as prime minister via a parliamentary vote in 2022, had \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22 following a prolonged struggle to hold a powershow in Islamabad. A day earlier, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said he did not think the opposition party would get permission to do so. “Viewing their past record, I don’t believe they will be allowed to rally in Islamabad,” the information minister said while speaking to the Geo News programme \"Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath\". Ostensibly, in response to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric of holding the rally in the federal capital, come what may, he said it was not the first time as former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak too had come with cranes and modern equipment. The minister had said despite the fact that Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) recent sit-in protest against inflated electricity bills was peaceful, they were not allowed to enter Islamabad. He suggested the KP government focus on health, education and anti-terrorism activities in the province. In the same programme, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat had said they would not stop holding the rally on August 22, even if the government used force against them. “The KP's caravan will be monumental and no one will be able to block it even if they try.”  The PTI lawmaker had further said they would not be carrying any weapons or petrol bombs. Instead, he had added, they would be armless and peaceful. “We will remain peaceful,” he had said. However, “if there is violence or firing, the entire Pakistan will rise up,” he had warned.  "

  "content": "KARACHI: A Karachi East court on Wednesday approved judicial remand of the woman accused of killing two people in a deadly accident on the metropolis's Karsaz Road.  The suspect, Natasha, has been remanded by the judicial magistrate a day after an order to bring her and her medical report before the court was issued.  A seven-day physical remand of the accused was sought by an investigation officer (IO) who stated that Secion-322 is a non-bailable offence.  The development comes after a case was lodged against the suspect who allegedly rammed her car into multiple vehicles on Monday which also resulted in five people being wounded. A day earlier, the court had given a one-day physical remand of the suspect who is a resident of Karachi's KDA Scheme-I area. Meanwhile, the two people who lost their lives have been identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif. Following the incident, police and Rangers had taken the woman driver into custody and brought her to the police station following the mishap and impounded her jeep. Subsequently she was also taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a medical check-up as she also received an injury to her head. A case had been filed by Imtiaz Arif, the deceased's brother, who has alleged that his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police had said since the suspect had a driving licence, therefore charges of culpable homicide would be applied to her case. Whereas, they had said, charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR. Providing details on the suspect's mental state, JPMC Psychiatry Department head Dr Chooni Lal said that she wasn't in good condition when she was brought there. Noting that the suspect's family wasn't able to provide any medical records regarding their claims that she was mentally ill, Dr Lal has stated that she does not requires \"psychological assistance.\" She also clarified that the woman did not try to harm herself in the hospital. Furthermore, the suspect had been discharged from the JPMC where she was taken after the fatal accident. It is to be noted that previously the investigation officer (IO) had submitted a report about the suspect’s non-appearance before the court, saying that JPMC hospital psychiatric specialist Dr Lal had admitted the suspect to the hospital after examining her condition. According to the doctor the suspect was not in a condition to be allowed for an appearance before the court, said the IO while apprising the magistrate. Meanwhile, the CCTV footage obtained by Geo News show the father- daughter duo could be seen commuting on a bike. A speeding white luxury vehicle is also seen following and hitting the bike in the video. The woman does not stop the vehicle after crashing into the motorcycle and runs away. Police said investigation was expedited with the help of the surveillance camera footage."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: After distancing himself from the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on Wednesday demanded an open trial of Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid who taken into military custody over allegations of abuse of power and violating Army Act. The former prime minister, who was removed from office via a parliamentary vote in 2022, said the open trial would benefit the country and allow it to prosper. \"I demand an open trial of Faiz Hamid with media should be given access to cover it,\" said the ex-premier during an informal interaction with journalists in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where has been incarcerated for over a year in different cases ranging from corruption to terrorism. Responding to Khan’s statement, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar termed the ex-prime minister's statement an intervention in the army’s affairs. Taking a swipe at the former PM, the information said the PTI founder was continuously trying to make the matter related to the army's internal accountability process \"controversial\" through his statements. Tarar asked Imran to submit his response in the £190m case instead of giving statements to defend Hamid. He added that the PTI founder's contradictory statements regarding the ex-ISI chief reflected that he is quite worried. Following the former spymaster's arrest, the ex-premier had distanced himself from the retired general, who served as DG ISI during his tenure, claiming that he has no connection with him. \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter. Welcoming the development, the former premier said it was good that army launched the process of internal accountability, he noted. However, he urged the military to ensure that the process of accountability should be across the board. Responding to a question relating to his past engagement with the former spymaster, Khan said that while he was the premier he did not want to remove General Faiz from his office amid regime change in Afghanistan. The embattled PTI founder further detailed he had exchanged heated words with the former army chief, General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa over the issue of removing the former ISI boss from his post, adding Bajwa removed Faiz for the sake of his extension. \"I repeatedly asked Bajwa not to remove Faiz but to no avail,\" he added. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had announced the arrest of the former ISI chief on August 12, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said. The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, it added. Three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Hamid’s arrest in connection with the same housing scheme case. Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank. The two retired brigadiers were identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster. The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) has finally commented on the prevailing internet disruption, blaming the issue on a \"fault in the submarine cable\". Briefing the National Assembly Standing Committee on IT on Wednesday, PTA Chairman Major General (retd) Hafeez-Ur-Rehman said: \"Submarine Consortium has informed [us] that the internet [services] are affected due to a fault in the submarine cable which will be resolved by August 27.\" The regulatory body's chief further noted that seven fibre optic cables are connected with Pakistan of which one is damaged. The PTA chief's remarks come in the wake of the prevailing internet slowdown and limited connectivity that experts and stakeholders have attributed to the purported testing of an internet firewall to rein in social media, which is equipped with filters to block unwanted content from reaching a wider audience. Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) and IT experts have slammed the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led government over the issue, citing the economic impact on freelancers, IT professionals and the digital economy in general. With P@SHA estimating a loss of $300 million loss in light of existing complaints by the businesses and the reputational damage, WISPAP Chairman Shahzad Arshad has said that businesses and individuals who depend on reliable internet connectivity which is an essential pillar of the country’s digital economy were now \"struggling to maintain operations, and the slowdown is threatening their very survival”. However, the government has denied its involvement in the issue with State Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja blaming the use of virtual private networks (VPN) by internet users as the reason \"their phones\" slowed down. \"I can swear that the government of Pakistan did not block the internet or slow it down,” she said while speaking to the media last week. During the standing committee's meeting today, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Amin Ul Haq inquired the PTA chairman about the reasons behind internet disruptions. \"The public should be informed why internet service is affected. It should be informed whether a firewall is installed or not?\" the lawmaker asked, adding that the PTA should communicate the matter with the media so that the public is informed. Responding to the query, Gen Rehman referred to IT Minister Khawaja's remarks saying that the reasons behind the prevailing issue were duly addressed in the minister's presser and remarked that the use of VPNs led to the internet being down. Elaborating on the firewall issue, the PTA chief said that the previous web management system (WMS) was renamed and replaced with the firewall technology after its approval in 2019. \"The [internet] firewall system was approved in March 2019,\" he said adding that the upgradation of the system had started the same year. When grilled by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub regarding firewall installation, the PTA chairman said: \"This system was introduced during your regime.\" Separately, speaking with journalists outside the NA, PTA chief maintained that the firewall — which he termed “web management system” — is aimed at controlling grey traffic. \"There's no mention of the word 'firewall'. It has been created by you [media]. Who said it's a firewall, it's [actually] web management system,\" he said. Furthermore, the PTA head remarked: \"How can you eliminate propaganda from the firewall? Memes are being shared on social media against judges and prime minister. If the issue could be managed in this way then we would've closed it.\" Commenting on privacy concerns regarding firewall, Gen Rehman told the NA committee that social media platforms were end-to-end encrypted and there was no technology to access encrypted information. Speaking on the government's decision to whitelist virtual private networks (VPNs), the PTA chief said VPNs were not being banned or shutdown but in fact the companies have only been asked to register themselves. \"VPNs are not blocked in the world [as] it affects businesses,\" he noted. When asked by committee members about the economic impact of the disruption, Gen Rehman claimed that the telecom sector didn't suffer much. Addressing the IT ministry, the NA panel has also sought the report on both the economic repercussions of the internet disruptions as well as the technicalities of the firewall in the next meeting."

  "content": "TEHRAN: At least 28 people were killed and 23 others sustained injuries after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims met with an accident in Yazd, Iran, said Pakistan's Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu on Wednesday.  The ambassador's statement comes after a bus carrying Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire near Taftan-Dehshir checkpoint, reported Iranian media.  \"Embassy officials have already left for Yazd this morning. An officer in Zahedan is overseeing emergency arrangements,\" the ambassador further said. Speaking with Geo News, the envoy said overspeeding and brake failure caused the ill-fated bus to crash into a school wall. Maulana Qamar Abbas Naqvi — a member of a peace committee based in Larkana — said at least 30 people died on the spot, while five succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. He maintained that the 15 injured are in critical condition. On the other hand, Iran's Mehr News Agency said that the number of killed people in the accident was 28 with emergency imposed in hospitals across the city to treat the injured. The bus, which had 53 passengers on board, met with the accident last night. The police and rescue officials rushed to the scene and shifted the bodies and the injured to the hospital. As per details received from sources earlier today, the bus was carrying more than 50 passengers, including 14 women. They added that 10 people hailed from Khairpur, whereas six were from Kashmore. Syed Athar Shamsi, the leaders of the convoy which left from Larkana to participate in Arbaeen, said that the group of pilgrims were commuting in two buses. The bus moving ahead met with the accident, while the other one was left behind due to documentation related issues. Crisis management director general of Yazd province, while talking to Iranian state TV, confirmed that 11 women and 17 men lost their lives in the accident, reported Reuters. \"Seven of the injured people are in critical condition and six injured people have now left the hospital,\" he said adding that Pakistan's consular services in Iran have been invited to Yazd province to follow up on the accident. Iranian traffic police have said that preliminary investigations reveal that the accident was caused by a technical defect in the bus braking system. Speaking to Geo.tv Maulana Shah Murad Sharifi, a Qom seminary student hailing from Larkana, said that the pilgrims' convoy comprised two buses carrying around 52 passengers each. Elaborating on the current situation, he said that apart from five to six people who suffered minor injuries, most of the passengers of the ill-fated bus were in critical condition and were being treated in a local government hospital. When asked about what caused the fatal accident, Sharifi said he had heard people saying that the vehicle's brakes had failed before the accident. Reacting to the incident, President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed grief and regret over the loss of precious life. The president has directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance to the wounded and help bring the bodies back to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PT) leader and National Assembly Opposition Leade Omar Ayub have also separately expressed condolences and prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded pilgrims."

  "content": "Issuing its detailed verdict in the Margalla Hills case, the Supreme Court directed the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board to take over the eateries on September 11 with the help of police and the Capital Development Authority (CDA). \"On 11 September 2024, the Wildlife Board will take over the possession of the said restaurants with the full assistance of CDA and the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, and the entrances to said area shall be barricaded,\" read the 25-page judgment penned by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa. The judgement comes after the apex court on June 11 had ordered the closure of Monal Restaurant along with other eateries located in the Margalla Hills National Park (MHPN). The order of the three-member bench, comprising the CJP, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, came in response to in response to a March 11 court order in which it had sought the complete record of the land ownership of the restaurant. The court had then also directed all other restaurants in the National Park including Monal to relocate within the three-month period. In its remarks, the SC said that its aim is to ensure the protection of the National Park. It added that apart from National Park, the unnecessary notices issued to all other restaurants are terminated. Stressing that it was only focusing on the National Park, the court said: \"All the leases granted to restaurants located in National Park are declared null and void.\"  In his detailed judgement today which upheld the Islamabad High Court's then-judge Athar Minallah's ruling, CJP Isa said that the restaurants were to be demolished with minimal disturbance to the wildlife and by avoiding damage to the trees of the National Park. The top court's order also states that the Wildlife Board will determine how best to utilise the mountain ridge where the eateries were located and it may consult experts and environmentalists to examine whether the foundations of the said structures should also be removed or the same be left in and used to make an artificial lake to collect rainwater which can be used to put out fires that erupt in the National Park.  \"Under no circumstances should the building be left abandoned/derelict nor leave any debris on the said site. Every effort should be made to ensure that the said land again becomes an integral part of the National Park,\" said the verdict. Furthermore, directing the defence secretary to ensure the enforcement of existing laws, the SC has also ordered the CDA chairman to provide guidance to the ministry in this regard. Additionally, the Ministry of Climate Change secretary and Environmental Protection director general have been ordered to conduct a survey of buildings in the area. The order also calls for an assessment of environmental damage and measures that are necessary to prevent further environmental degradation."

  "content": "ATTOCK: At least two children have been killed and five were injured after gunmen opened fire at a school van in Dheri Kot, Attock, rescue officials told Geo News on Thursday. The ages of the children injured in the gun attack are between five to 12 years old, they added. They have been shifted to the hospital, said the rescue officials. The children killed in the attack included a nine-year-old and a 10-year-old, while the five injured included two eight-year-olds, one was seven, one one was 12 and one child is four years old. The two children — both girls named Arwa Fatima and Rameen Shafiq — died on the spot. The rescue officials, who reached the site after the attack, shifted the injured children and dead bodies to the Asfandyar Bukhari District Hospital Attock. In the wake of the attack, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has sought a report from Rawalpindi Commissioner Abdul Aamer Khattak. The chief minister has also expressed deep sorrow over the death of the two children in the attack. CM Maryam also directed relevant authorities to provide the best treatment facilities to the children who have sustained injuries. Attock Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza, in conversation with Geo News, said that the gun attack on the school van was a result of the driver’s personal enmity. He added that a forest official and his friend were killed due to this enmity last month and the van driver — Afzaal — was attacked to avenge the murder. The DC explained that the driver was injured in the attack, but the children were also attacked. According to the DC, two girls —seated in the passenger seat with the driver — were killed in the attack, while the driver himself is injured. He added that the police and administration are busy in search operation for the gunmen who fled the scene after indiscriminately targeting the van. DC said that the report of the incident has been sent to the Rawalpindi commissioner. President Asif Ali Zardari has condemned the \"cruel\" attack on children in Attock. In a statement, the president said targeting innocent children is a very cruel and shameful act, directing authorities to take strict action against those responsible. Condemning the unfortunate incident, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the attack on innocent children is extremely \"cruel and barbaric\". He has directed the authorities to take strict action against those responsible. Punjab Governor Saleem Haider Khan has also strongly condemned the targeting of the school van, expressing deep sorrow over the tragic deaths of the minors. Describing the attack as \"heartbreaking\", the governor ordered authorities to swiftly investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday put off its public gathering in Islamabad and rescheduled it for September 8, after the local administration of the city revoked its no objection certificate and sealed roads leading to the federal capital. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the notification about postponement of the rally had been issued and it would now be held on September 8, as per instruction of PTI founder Imran Khan. “We postponed the jalsa following a meeting with the PTI founder in Adiala jail,” he said. PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub also confirmed date for the rally was changed on instruction of Imran. “We have received information that the government is conspiring to spread anarchy, under the cover of the jalsa,” he maintained. Upon the opposition party’s announcement of a new date for the rally, the Islamabad administration issued a notification granting it permission in this regard.  The notification containing 40 instructions is issued by the district magistrate of the federal capital.  “The Islamabad administration revoked the NOC due to protests of the religious parties. The administration would provide security for the September 8 gathering,” it said. However, the notification warned that fundamental rights of the citizens should not be violated by the participants of the rally. People should gather at 4pm and the event should be concluded by 7pm.  “It will be the jalsa organiser’s duty to disperse the party workers at the end of the rally. The workers will not be allowed to stay at the rally site on September 8,” it said.  The notification reemphasised that the permission is granted for public gathering and not for a sit-in. “No object of lethal or non-lethal force including batons of any size would be wielded by any participant of the gathering nor any participant shall indulge in violence or clashes. In case of any such incidence of clashes/ violence the organisers shall be held responsible. “Organisers are bound to ensure that the participants do not spend the night or subsequent nights there and are dispersed peacefully,” it maintained. After the PTI earlier vowed to hold a protest in Islamabad despite the revocation of the NOC for the event, the police sealed multiple key arteries, particularly entry and exit points of the federal capital city. Police sealed major thoroughfares leading to Islamabad through Faizabad, the Double Road and Chongi No 26 bus stop as well, leaving the people stuck in traffic as long queues of vehicles are formed due to the road closure. Metro Bus service has also been suspended in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, while a heavy contingent of police has been deployed on the alternative routes for the public’s facilitation and security. Additionally, security was put on high alert, while red zone areas as well as entry and exit points of the federal capital had been sealed. D-Chowk, too, has been closed by placing containers. Only Margalla Avenue is open from one side for entry into the red zone but the avenue is closed from the GT Road. Several other arteries are also choked with traffic as the district administrations of the twin cities placed containers on them, including Motorway M-2 (Islamabad Lane) as Kalarkahar, Balaksar and Nela interchanges are blocked.  Containers have been placed near Sawan on GT Road, near T-Chowk in Rawat, near Carriage Factory and motorway from Islamabad Link has also been closed.  This may take a significant amount of time to resume normal flow of the vehicular traffic even after the PTI’s announcement to defer the public meeting as scores of heavy containers would have to be moved away, after clearing the roads of traffic. Meanwhile, the Islamabad district administration has already announced to keep all the public and private educational institutions closed on Thursday. On the other hand, the district administration has imposed Section 144 till August 24 in Rawalpindi, banning public gatherings, demonstrations, and sit-ins. The administration had annulled the NOC issued to the PTI for the rally. In a statement on Wednesday, PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said that the district administration had cancelled the notification, but “we haven’t cancelled the jalsa”. “A peaceful political struggle is our constitutional and legal right,” he said. The district administration revoked the NOC granted to PTI on the “report of district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa. The session also reviewed the NOC, granted by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad. During the meeting, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ali Nasir Rizvi pointed out the security concerns due to multiple events. Citing strict security concerns, the administration noted that the Bangladesh cricket team is in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a rally.  “A few days ago, some protesters also reached the Supreme Court building,” it said, adding that in such circumstances, permission to hold public rallies cannot be given. Imran, who was removed as prime minister via a parliamentary vote in 2022, had \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22 following a prolonged struggle to hold a power show in Islamabad. Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif had said that the party would not try to violate the law on their part but vowed to hold the rally come what may.

  "content": "   Responding to incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's demand for an \"open trial\" of ex-spymaster Faiz Hamid, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that Imran Khan's trial will be open if it is held in a military court in connection with May 9 riots. The defence minister's statement came hours after the former premier called for an open trial of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid who was taken into custody by the military over alleged abuse of power and the Army Act violation earlier this month. \"We don't have any precedent that any general’s military trial held in an open court in the country's history,\" said Asif while speaking on Geo News programme Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath. \"If the PTI founder faces any trial in a military court, then I can assure you that it would be open to the public and media because he is a civilian.\" He further clarified that it is the military's tradition not to conduct open trials of its employees and officers. Accusing the former ruling party of working in collusion with the detained former spy chief, Asif said that the last year's May 9 violent protests triggered by Khan's arrest and saw attacks on state properties including military installations were pre-planned. He further alleged that the PTI founder provided the manpower for the May 9 riots while the former top spy \"masterminded the conspiracy\".  When questioned about the deposed prime minister's statements denying any connections with the former ISI chief, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader claimed that not only Khan, PTI's second-tier leadership had openly admitted to being in contact with Gen (retd) Faiz even after May 9, 2023, riots. During an informal interaction with journalists in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail earlier today, the former prime minister, who was removed from office via a parliamentary vote in 2022, said the open trial of ex-ISI chief would benefit the country and allow it to prosper. Responding to Khan’s statement, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar termed the ex-prime minister’s statement an intervention in the army’s affairs. Taking a swipe at the former PM, the information said the PTI founder was continuously trying to make the matter related to the army’s internal accountability process “controversial” through his statements. Following the former spymaster's arrest, the ex-premier had distanced himself from the retired general, who served as DG ISI during his tenure, claiming that he has no connection with him. \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had announced the arrest of the former ISI chief on August 12, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said. The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, it added. Three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Hamid’s arrest in connection with the same housing scheme case. Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank. The two retired brigadiers were identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster."

  "content": "LONDON: Independent candidate Adnan Hussain who broke a nearly 70-year record by unseating a Labour candidate in the northwestern ex-industrial town of Blackburn has said that Gaza was the issue that catapulted him to the UK parliament after voters saw the first ever livestreamed genocide on media - Israel’s war on Palestine that has killed over 45,000 Palestinians. The 34-year-old British Pakistani lawyer and political novice defeated Labour's Kate Hollern by just 132 votes - securing 10,518 votes to Hollern's 10,386 votes. Hussain, whose parents are from Gujrat, could have got more votes if this was not for the former British ambassador Craig Murray, who also stood on a pro-Gaza platform for George Galloway's Workers Party, came in third place with 7,105 votes and had the local anti-Gaza war vote split. Hussain told Geo News: “Our relatives have continued to call us from Pakistan, congratulating us on my win. The calls from the motherland are non-stop. People in Gujrat are proud and should be. Parents are always proud and very supportive. Everybody is extremely happy. I am getting calls on my WhatsApp from Pakistan all the time, mainly from Gujrat.” Hussain said he didn’t do anything much to win. “The voters saw the first ever livestreamed Gaza genocide on the media and went against the Labour. Truly even if I didn’t campaign, there was anger. I am aware I have won on the back of a genocide.” Hussain left the Labour Party in April 2020 after seeing the party “didn’t represent the interests of people”. “I have been voted in because people are unhappy about Gaza but also about local issues. People think the two main parties don’t represent them and don’t serve them. I accept it’s a protest vote. I will continue to put pressure on the govt on behalf of my voters. Poverty is a massive issue too and so is healthcare.” The 34-year-old solicitor says his life has changed since his elections and he will now have to focus full-time on politics. Hussain’s grandfather came to the UK around 70 years ago from Kharian in Pakistan and worked hard to educate his father who studied at the Liverpool University. Hussain, his brother and sister are all university graduates. Labour had managed to get 64.9% of the vote for Labour in 2019, but the party's early support for Israel’s war on Gaza was seen as a key driver for it losing the Muslim vote, who make up 35% of the local electorate. In dozens of constituencies, Labour’s vote collapsed where Muslims formed significant voting share over the issue of Gaza."

  "content": "   Addressing the National Youth Convention in Islamabad also attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on Wednesday expressed his firm resolve to win the war against terrorism. \"Pakistan's future is in safe hands,\" said the army chief while addressing the Islamabad event, adding that a strong bond between the nation, the government and the army guarantees the prosperity of the country. It is the state's responsibility to protect the nation from the adverse effects of social media, he added. Gen Munir also said that those people who built a narrative of Pakistan's default were found nowhere today.   \"One should ask the importance of an independent state from the people of Libya, Syria, Kashmir, and Gaza,\" he said. Urging the nation not to lose hope for a good future, the COAS said that they were forbidden to despair as Muslims. He went on the say that youth is the most important and expensive asset of Pakistan and they would not let anyone waste it at any cost. Gen Munir reiterated that it Is his firm belief that the country would defeat terrorism. He added that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) people have been standing alongside the Pakistan Army against the menace of terrorism for the last 22 years. He asked the tribes to help the state in resolving disputes through dialogues. The army chief's statement came after the federal government launched a new anti-terrorism operation, Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability), citing a rise in terrorist attacks across the country. Regarding the new counterterrorism drive, the military's media wing said last month that it aimed at harnessing the national counter-terrorism efforts in a synchronised manner to dismantle the nexus of terrorism and illegal spectrum in the country for enduring stability and economic prosperity. The Pakistan Army also categorically rejected criticism against the new anti-terror drive, vowing to combat \"digital terrorism\" conspirators abetted by foreign cohorts sowing discord through the peddling of fake news and propaganda. The institution also clarified that the new anti-terror drive would not be a large-scale military operation."

  "content": "  Referring to demolition of Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s statues during the recent protests led by students, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the one who spearheaded an anti-Pakistan movement met his fate. Infuriated people vandalised several statues, pictures and murals of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman following an end to Sheikh Hasina-led government who fled to India on board a military helicopter along with her sister. The Hasina government collapsed on the back of riots — one of the worst in the country's history of 50-odd years. Almost 300 people were killed and thousands of others injured in the recent violence that started in early July.  The protesters launched their rallies last month, demanding the government abolish civil service job quotas. However, the large-scale demonstrations escalated into the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule, with protesters later calling on the 76-year-old to step down. \"What goes around comes around\", the premier said while referring to the demolition of statues of Bangladesh former president, who according to him divided Pakistan.  Speaking about other issues at the National Youth Convention in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz said that Pakistan had sacrificed thousands of lives in its fight against terrorism besides suffering an economic loss of $150 billion. \"Not just Pakistan, the whole world has benefited from the elimination of terrorism by Pakistan,\" he added.  The Convention was attended by federal ministers, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir, Chairman of the Higher Education Commission, teachers, vice-chancellors and students from across the country.  Calling the 1973 Constitution a binding force for the nation, he said Pakistani nation also showed unity when the country carried out the nuclear tests in 1998 to make its defence impregnable, setting aside the serious challenges.  He said that besides the common citizens, the security forces played their fullest role in purging the country of terrorism, which the nation would always remember. Coming to the economic challenges, the prime minister said the government was compelled to privatise the Pakistan International Airline (PIA) which once used to be a model for other airlines in the region. \"Similarly, South Korea copied Pakistan’s five-year development plan and boosted its economy while Pakistan still lagged behind\". \"We have to decide whether the business will go as usual or we will move forward,\" he remarked. He assured that despite the challenges of electricity, revenue receipts and exports, the government would dole out maximum funds for youth empowerment and recalled the PML-government’s pro-youth steps in the past including the merit-based distribution of laptops, establishment of Punjab Education Endowment Fund to distribute scholarships worth Rs22 billion, and numerous schemes for skill development.  He further said that youth empowerment and the united efforts by the politicians and the national institutions were inevitable to put the country on the course to progress. The premier said it was the government’s responsibility to equip the youth with modern education, technology and skills to enable them to change the country’s fate and bring about a “revolution” of progress and prosperity. PM Shehbaz said the country’s youth had immense potential as for the last three years, Pakistani students were among the top achievers of the foreign scholarships. Urging the youth to go into the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been asked to instruct the commercial banks to allocate 40% of their loans for the sector. He also referred to the federal government’s Rs50 billion relief package for electricity consumers using up to 200 units for a three-month period. He said the Punjab government has also announced a Rs45 billion package to give Rs14 per unit subsidy to the consumers using 200-500 units which should also be copied by other provinces, instead of politicking on the matter. \"If we resolve to change Pakistan, it will not be too far when the country will emerge as a great nation. Today’s Pakistan and its prevailing circumstances necessitate politicians and national institutions to serve the country unitedly while observing their constitutional limits. If we do so, history will remember us forever otherwise the future generations will never forgive us,\" he added. "

  "content": "  ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has announced holding jalsa in the federal capital tomorrow (Thursday) despite the revocation of the non-objection certificate (NOC) that was granted earlier to the Imran Khan-founded party. In a statement, PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said that the district administration had cancelled the notification, but “we haven’t cancelled the jalsa”. “A peaceful political struggle is our constitutional and legal right.”  The district administration revoked the NOC granted to PTI on the “report of district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement.  The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa. The session also reviewed the NOC, granted by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad.  During the meeting, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ali Nasir Rizvi pointed out the security concerns due to multiple events.  Citing strict security concerns, the administration noted that the Bangladesh cricket team is in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a jalsa.  “A few days ago, some protesters also reached the Supreme Court building,” it said, adding that in such circumstances, permission to hold public rallies cannot be given.  The development came a day before the public rally was scheduled, as announced by Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif.  Imran Khan, who was removed as prime minister via a parliamentary vote in 2022,  had \"decided\" to hold a public rally in the federal capital on August 22 following a prolonged struggle to hold a powershow in Islamabad.  A day earlier, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said he did not think the opposition party would get permission to do so.  “Viewing their past record, I don’t believe they will be allowed to rally in Islamabad,” the information minister said while speaking to the Geo News programme \"Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath\". Ostensibly, in response to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric of holding the rally in the federal capital, come what may, he said it was not the first time as former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak too had come with cranes and modern equipment. The minister had said despite the fact that Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) recent sit-in protest against inflated electricity bills was peaceful, they were not allowed to enter Islamabad. He suggested the KP government to focus on health, education and anti-terrorism activities in the province. In the same programme, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat had said they would not stop holding the rally on August 22, even if the government used force against them. “The KP's caravan will be monumental and no one will be able to block it even if they try.”  The PTI lawmaker had further said they would not be carrying any weapons or petrol bombs. Instead, he had added, they would be armless and peaceful. “We will remain peaceful,” he had said. However, “if there is violence or firing, the entire Pakistan will rise up,” he had warned.  "

  "content": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan Army's Major Sania Safdar, who is serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), became its first peacekeeper to receive the 2023 \"Certificate of Recognition\" for advocating gender equality, according to the mission. The award, issued by the New York-based UN Department for Peace Operations, was presented to her by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in Cyprus, Colin Stewart. “Receiving this certificate as the first peacekeeper from UNFICYP is deeply meaningful to me and significant for our mission in Cyprus,” Maj Safdar said. “It serves as a testament to our commitment to gender equality.” Created in 2016, the UN's “Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award” recognises the dedication and efforts of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS).  In addition to the award, the Department for Peace Operations also recognises military personnel from other UN Missions who are contributing to advance the WPS' agenda in different countries where peacekeeping operations are in place. In Cyprus, Major Safdar is currently serving as the Mission's Force Signal Officer and one of the UNFICYP's military gender focal points. Her primary tasks involve overseeing communication systems and promoting gender equality within military component. Since her deployment last year, she proactively took charge of several initiatives to contribute to achieve this recognition by focusing on integrating the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda into military components of the mission's work, the mission said. As the mission's force signal officer serving in the field technology section, she was also involved in strengthening the effectiveness of joint patrols by incorporating communication tools to enhance military operations on the ground while, promoting gender representation in military. Participation of women in peacekeeping missions brings diverse perspectives and skills that enhance operational effectiveness and foster inclusive approaches to conflict resolution, according to the mission. Their meaningful participation promotes gender equality within operations, contributing to more comprehensive and sustainable peace efforts. “UNFICYP is on a steady curve to increase its statistics on the number of women in peacekeeping as well as promoting their participation while engaging with Member States to encourage further representation of uniformed women as critical actors in fulfilling the Mission's mandate.” Major Safdar's recognition award serves as a “testament to UNFICYP's commitment to gender equality”, it added."

  "content": " Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on Wednesday demanded an open trial of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid who was taken into custody by the military on charges of abuse of power and violating the Army Act. The former prime minister, who was removed from office via a parliamentary vote in 2022, said the open trial would benefit the country and allow it to prosper. \"I demand an open trial of Faiz Hamid with media should be given access to cover it,\" said the ex-premier during an informal interaction with journalists in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where has been incarcerated for over a year in different cases ranging from corruption to terrorism. Responding to Khan’s statement, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar termed the ex-prime minister’s statement an intervention in the army’s affairs. Taking a swipe at the former PM, the information said the PTI founder was continuously trying to make the matter related to the army’s internal accountability process “controversial” through his statements. Tarar asked Imran to submit his response in the £190m case instead of giving statements to defend Hamid. He added that the PTI founder’s contradictory statements regarding the ex-ISI chief reflected that he is quite worried. Following the former spy master's arrest, the ex-premier had distanced himself from the retired general, who served as DG ISI during his tenure,  claiming that he has no connection with him. \"If the military wants the accountability of General Faiz [then] it should proceed and do it,\" Khan said, asserting that it is the army's internal matter. Welcoming the development, the former premier said it was good that army launched the process of internal accountability, he noted. However, he urged the military to ensure that the process of accountability should be across the board. Responding to a question relating to his past engagement with the former spymaster, Khan said that while he was the premier he did not want to remove General Faiz from his office amid regime change in Afghanistan. The embattled PTI founder further detailed he had exchanged heated words with the former army chief, General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa over the issue of removing the former ISI boss from his post, adding Bajwa removed Faiz for the sake of his extension. \"I repeatedly asked Bajwa not to remove Faiz but to no avail,\" he added. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had announced the arrest of the former ISI chief on August 12, saying that he was \"taken into custody\" over allegations of land grabbing and snatching valuables from the owner of a private housing society. \"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City Case made against Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hamid,\" the army's media wing said. The process of court martial has been initiated against the former chief of the country's premier spy agency over complaints in the Top City Case, it added. Three more retired officers were taken into military custody after Hamid’s arrest in connection with the same housing scheme case. Sources told Geo News that two of the officers in the military custody were of brigadier rank and one was of colonel rank. The two retired brigadiers were identified as Ghaffar and Naeem while the retired colonel’s name is Asim, they said, adding that they worked as messengers between a political party and the ex-spymaster. The two brigadiers, alleged of facilitation, hailed from Chakwal, the sources further said."

  "content": " KARACHI: A Karachi East court on Wednesday sent the woman, accused of killing two people in a road accident on Karsaz Road, to jail on judicial remand. The judicial magistrate remanded the suspect, Natasha, in the judicial custody a day after an order to produce her before the court was issued along with a medical report. An investigation officer (IO) had sought seven-day physical remand of the accused, stating that the Section-322 is non-bailable offence. The development comes after a case was lodged against the suspect who allegedly rammed her car into multiple vehicles on Monday which also resulted in five people being wounded. A day earlier, the court had given a one-day physical remand of the suspect who is a resident of Karachi's KDA Scheme-I area. Meanwhile, the two people who lost their lives have been identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif. Following the incident, police and Rangers had taken the woman driver into custody and brought her to the police station following the mishap and impounded her jeep. Subsequently she was also taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a medical check-up as she also received an injury to her head. A case had been filed by Imtiaz Arif, the deceased's brother, who has alleged that his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police had said since the suspect had a driving licence, therefore charges of culpable homicide would be applied to her case. Whereas, they had said, charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR. Suspect discharged from JPMC Providing details on the suspect's mental state, JPMC Psychiatry Department head Dr Chooni Lal said that she wasn't in good condition when she was brought there. Noting that the suspect's family wasn't able to provide any medical records regarding their claims that she was mentally ill, Dr Lal has stated that she does not require \"psychological assistance.\" She also clarified that the woman did not try to harm herself in the hospital. Furthermore, the suspect had been discharged from the JPMC where she was taken after the fatal accident. It is to be noted that previously the investigation officer (IO) had submitted a report about the suspect’s non-appearance before the court, saying that JPMC hospital psychiatric specialist Dr Lal had admitted the suspect to the hospital after examining her condition. According to the doctor the suspect was not in a condition to be allowed for an appearance before the court, said the IO while apprising the magistrate. Meanwhile, the CCTV footage obtained by Geo News show the father- daughter duo could be seen commuting on a bike. A speeding white luxury vehicle is also seen following and hitting the bike in the video. The woman does not stop the vehicle after crashing into the motorcycle and runs away. Police said investigation was expedited with the help of the surveillance camera footage."

  "content": "LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing on Wednesday has booked a Lahore man — linked to the recent violent anti-immigrant riots across the United Kingdom — on \"technical assistance of cybercrime\" charges. The man, who has been identified as Farhan Asif, has been accused of spreading misinformation about the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the knife attack that killed three minor girls on July 29, 2024, in the UK. The stabbing then led to widespread far-right riots which saw numerous mosques, asylum centres and immigrant homes being attacked in several regions of Britain, resulting in thousands of arrests. Asif was arrested on Tuesday night in Lahore's DHA area and was handed over to the FIA cybercrime wing for interrogation. The case against Asif was filed under Section 9 and 10A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, in the complaint of \"technical assistant of cybercrime\". The first information report (FIR) stated that Asif, who works for a news platform based in Pakistan, confessed to the crime which included sharing photos of the stabbing and an article about the incident on X. \"The article shared by Asif falsely claimed that a 17-year-old Muslim boy named Ali Al-Shakti, who migrated to the UK by boat in 2023, was responsible for the stabbing,\" the FIR stated. Additionally, the FIR revealed that the accused had admitted to giving false information to a foreign channel and, during the investigation, he also attempted to blame others. During the investigation, which was led by the investigating agency’s Additional Director Cybercrime Chaudhry Sarfaraz, it was confirmed that the X account belonged to Asif. Two laptops along with a mobile phone were also recovered from the accused as part of the investigation, as per the FIR. The FIA sources further said that Farhan had confessed to interrogators that he once published a story on his news website without knowing that the post would go viral."

  "content": "   LONDON: Former prime minister Imran Khan has sought the help of the newly elected UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to raise awareness of threats to democracy in Pakistan. In an interview to British news channel, ITV News, from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, Khan congratulated the new British premier for his election victory but asked him to imagine senior Labour Party figures being “abducted in the dead of night” during the UK election campaign to understand the erosion of democracy in Pakistan. “For nearly a year now, I have been confined in a seven-by-eight-foot death cell, a space typically reserved for terrorists and those on death row,” he said via lawyers. ITV said his lawyers sent answers of questions sent by ITV News. “Surveillance is constant, stripping away any semblance of privacy.” The 71-year-old former cricket star said he was “resolute and ready” for democratic change, adding that despite his condition, prayers, reading and exercise had given him strength. “I am both mentally and physically prepared for the struggle ahead. True democratic change and freedom in Pakistan are never going to be easy,” he said. Khan told ITV: “I urge PM Starmer and his cabinet, who assumed power through the genuine will of the people without any electoral manipulation, to imagine if their overwhelming victory was stolen. Picture a scenario where a party that barely won 18 seats usurped your mandate, where your party symbols were stripped, and your leaders were imprisoned or tortured until they switched allegiances or left politics altogether. Imagine homes broken into and women and children abducted in the dead of night.\" He added that his party has been \"brutally suppressed\". “The people of Pakistan yearned for change, for democracy, and for the rule of law to prevail. Their votes were a cry for justice, self-determination, and freedom.” ITV also interviewed Imran Khan's international adviser Sayed Zulfiqar Bukhari who confirmed Khan is now seeking to become the next chancellor of Oxford University, where he studied during the 1970s. An application form was submitted on his behalf for an election later this year, Bukhari said.  If successful, he would replace Chris Patten, the former government minister. When asked by ITV News whether a new British government should amplify calls for his release, Khan warned that the administration carried “tremendous responsibility and high expectations” on the world stage. “The world is watching them and looking to them for leadership, especially in light of the horrific situation in Gaza and the erosion of democratic principles globally. \"We have a collective duty to uphold the values of peace and strive for freedom and fairness for everyone. Where the UK stands in its commitment to these values will speak volumes.” Khan added that Starmer should do more to tackle anti-Muslim hatred in the UK. “Having spent much time in the UK during my cricketing days, it saddens me to see the rise of Islamophobia over the past decade. I hope the newly appointed government can curb the bigotry that has affected Muslims and people of all faiths.”"

  "description": "The Supreme Court on Thursday took up the Punjab government’s urgent application seeking omissions of certain portions from its July 24 verdict in the Mubarak Ahmad Sani case. On February 6, a two-judge SC bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, overturned the conviction of Mubarak Sani, who was accused of an offence in 2019 under the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act. In its judgement, the court noted that the offence that the defendant had been accused of was not criminalised till 2021. Consequently, the apex court set aside the conviction and ordered the immediate release of the petitioner.      This led to what the government and the legal community termed a “malicious and slanderous campaign” against the CJP, even prompting the Supreme Court to issue a clarification. The decision was subsequently challenged by the Punjab government on the grounds that paragraph 9 of the order, regarding Article 20 of the Constitution, needed to be modified as the rights of the citizens as envisaged under the provision were not absolute and instead subject to law, public order, and morality. While accepting the pleas, the Supreme Court on July 24 reportedly declared that the right to profess religion and religious freedom, as ensured by the Constitution, was subject to law, morality, and public order. The judgment had emphasised that complete faith in the finality of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) was the very foundation of Islam — a belief without which nobody can be described as a Muslim. However, earlier this month, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) expressed its reservations over a number of reasons given in the SC’s second judgment. Expressing the hope that the SC “will soon review its decision”, the CII had urged the government to play an effective role in the matter. Various groups, including religio-political parties, have voiced their objections by carrying out rallies and even breaching the apex court’s security as they held protests.      The matter has come under discussion in the National Assembly by both the treasury and opposition benches, while the KP Assembly had also unanimously passed a resolution expressing concern over the SC verdict. Subsequently, on August 17, the Punjab government filed an application seeking corrections that some clerics deemed were needed in the SC’s July 24 clarification. According to the petition, some leading clerics and members of parliament requested the federal government to approach SC and highlight some portions of the verdict that they say merited correction. The application explains that some observations and findings contained in some other paragraphs of the judgment appeared to be an accidental error and contrary to the precedents as mentioned by the top court. Today’s hearing Today, a three-member bench — led by CJP Isa and including justices Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — took up the Punjab government’s petition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam—Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman — one of the religious scholars who had requested the government to seek another review of the ruling — appeared before the court. Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan was also present during the hearing while prominent religious scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani appeared via video link. At the outset of the hearing, AGP Awan informed the bench that the Parliament and some clerics had asked the federal government to approach the SC regarding the matter. He further said that a letter was received from the NA speaker and directives were also issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Admitting that a “second review” of the original verdict could not be held, the AGP noted that hence, the government had approached the court as per the Code of Civil Procedure. AGP Awan urged the court to hear clerics’ arguments since the matter was a religious one. “I don’t want to say but am helpless; I pray in every prayer that may God not make me make any wrong decision,” CJP Isa said. “A person is known by their actions and words,” he observed. The chief justice stressed that the Parliament’s words were highly respected by the court. The court then decided to seek assistance from clerics present in the courtroom, including Fazl, Mufti Sher Muhammad, Sahibzada Abul Khair, Muhammad Zubair and Jamaat-i-Islami’s Fareed Paracha. CJP Isa then noted that the court had also sought assistance from Mufti Taqi Usmani but he was in Turkiye. Therefore, the scholar joined via video link. Mufti Muneebur Rehman’s representative was also present. Justice Isa then asked Fazl to state before the court if there were any “mistakes or objections” to the judgment in the case, adding that he would listen to others as well.  More to follow "

The bodies were discovered on Friday near a college in Dalbandin city, close to the borders with Afghanistan and Iran in Balochistan. A statement from the Afghan embassy in Islamabad said the bodies were handed over to families at the Spin Boldak-Chaman border crossing on Wednesday. Their consulate in Balochistan made “serious efforts” to return the bodies to waiting relatives in Afghanistan. “The five Afghans were brutally killed by unknown people,” said the statement shared with AFP on Thursday. Some 600,000 Afghans have travelled to Pakistan since the Taliban took back power in 2021 and implemented their austere version of Islam. Since last year, however, Islamabad has waged a campaign to evict huge numbers of undocumented Afghans, as relations with Kabul soured over security. "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Referring to the economic challenges, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday he would soon announce a five-year homegrown economic programme for the revival of the national economy. \"The ‘Home-Grown Economic Program’ would envisage measures to boost the country's economy by uplifting agriculture, information technology and other untapped sectors,\" the prime minister said, addressing the launching ceremony of the Buna-Raast connectivity project in Islamabad. He said broad parameters for the programme had already been finalised through months-long deliberations with the stakeholders.  \"Great work has gone into it. By next week or so, we will finalise it. I will go to the people to announce the programme for the next five years,\" he remarked. Highlighting the challenges of reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and power sector, Shehbaz said he was personally monitoring the FBR’s digitisation and that the government was hopeful of positive outcomes of power sector reforms. \"There is no magic wand. It is all about hard work, sacrifice, blood and sweat. Insha Allah, you will see we will have dividends and will find our place in the comity of nations through hard work, hard work and hard work,\" he said. Under the Buna-Raast connectivity project, the Raast payment mechanism is being linked with the Arab Monetary Fund’s (AMF) Buna system to facilitate millions of overseas Pakistanis in Arab countries to send remittances through a swift, affordable and effective mechanism. The prime minister said that besides easing the remittance-sending process digitally, it would also help boost the country’s foreign exchange and further strengthen the already cordial relations between Pakistan and the Arab world. Calling it a great step forward in promoting financial transactions through modern techniques, he said the project would expand the reach of Pakistan’s digital payment infrastructure. \"This signifies how 21st-century Pakistan is moving ahead by augmenting modern technologies in the people's lives. This is the first cross-border real-time payment system linkage that will make remittances more affordable and accessible,\" he said. Moreover, PM Shehbaz said that the project also held the potential to accelerate the connectivity into a future model of a wider payment system where transactions would take place from region to region with a potential of over $20 billion in annual payments. He thanked the AFM, State Bank of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Karandaaz for their support in launching the project. Earlier, he also gave away the mementos to AMF Chairperson Dr Fahad Alturki, SBP Governor Jamil Ahmed, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation President Dr Anita Zaidi, and Karandaaz CEO Waqasul Hassan. In his remarks, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that macroeconomic stability was taking root in Pakistan’s economy as manifested by reduced current account deficit, stable currency, improved foreign reserves, upgraded sovereign ratings, and reviving investors' confidence. He said the government was committed to infrastructural reforms and that its efforts were bearing fruits, though a lot more was yet to be done. The remittances were on the surge with $3 billion received in July, he added. About the Buna-Raast connectivity project, he said the digitalisation would help bring transparency and reduce leakages in remittances, taxation and the power sectors. He said the project would put the country on a sustainable path and on the right side of the FATF. Zaidi said the project would link the economies of Pakistan and the Arab world digitally, boost productivity and bring efficiency to systems. Besides, it will also improve individuals' lives making it cheaper to send money and improve families’ economic condition as 90% of remittance receivers were women. She viewed that the project would facilitate, particularly women entrepreneurs enabling them to sell their goods and receive money digitally."

  "description": "To encourage more women to pursue sports and play their best, the government must provide monetary support for their transport, nutrition and health needs.   IPS Goalkeeper Rehana Jamali, 17, is jubilant. Her team came in second in the All Sindh Women Hockey Tournament, held last...",
  "content": "Goalkeeper Rehana Jamali, 17, is jubilant. Her team came in second in the All Sindh Women Hockey Tournament, held last month. “We were the youngest of the seven teams,” she told IPS over the phone from Jacobabad, Sindh province. The city hit headlines two years ago after being termed the hottest city on earth when its temperatures rose to 50 degrees Celsius. This year, the mercury shot up to 52°C there. “We were training for the tournament from May to June, when the heat was at its worst,” Jamali said. “Obviously, this affected our game,” she admitted. “You cannot imagine the obstacles these girls have to overcome,” pointed out Erum Baloch, 32, a schoolteacher and a former hockey player, who runs the only women’s sports academy in Jacobabad, the Stars Women Sports Academy, of which Jamali is a member. In many parts of Pakistan, especially in small towns like Jacobabad, women are supposed to maintain a certain degree of invisibility and not bring too much attention to themselves. Exercising, stretching or even doing yoga postures while wearing T-shirts and track pants in a public place where men can watch, is awkward for many women in the country, as these can reveal a woman’s body shape. A 2022 study, found that “almost 90 per cent” of Pakistani women and girls do not participate in sports or physical activities because of “religious and cultural limitations, a lack of permission from parents, and a lack of sports facilities and equipment”. “Even when facilities are present in Pakistan, they are often outdated, open-air, and/or mixed gender, with female students often feeling embarrassed to participate in sports alongside, or be visible to, men. Hence, such women decide not to use these facilities,” the study pointed out. Baloch left sports because Jacobabad could not provide women like her with “proper grounds, equipment or coaches.” These are the very reasons why she wanted to open an academy just for women. It is completely free of charge, as “most girls come from extremely modest backgrounds and cannot even afford to pay for transport, a healthy meal or even bottled water,” she said. “Erum pays for my daily commute to and from the sports ground,” Jamali said. In fact, Baloch spends between Rs25,000 and Rs30,000 ($90 and $108) each month from her own pocket to pay for the transport, bottled water during training and sachets of oral rehydration salts for some 30 to 40 girls, aged between 9 and 18. Haseena Liaqat Ali, 19, was the most promising athlete at Baloch’s academy but six months ago she missed the trials for selection in the Pakistan Army’s team after she got infected with Hepatitis A. “With rising gas and electricity prices, they cannot even afford to boil water at home,” said the coach, who thinks unclean water is a big reason for the people contracting the disease. “I still feel very weak,” Ali said. Having left her treatment midway as her father could not afford the medicines, she has had a relapse. “Life is unjust for the poor,” Baloch said, adding, “Sports stars often come from small towns like ours.” But it is not just the cultural and economic barriers that are keeping Pakistani women out of the sporting arena; they must fight another barrier — climate change-induced rising temperatures. “We get tired quickly,” Jamali said. Haseena Soomro, 19, another athlete at the same academy, said: “The heat is unbearable, and we are unable to run fast.” The girls play on astroturf, which absorbs more heat from the sun than grass and has no natural way of cooling. But Baloch said it was better than playing on loose earth, which they did in the past. “The sand would go in our eyes and because of the high temperatures, the soil would get too hot during the day.” Further, she said there was always the danger of snakes lurking under the earth. To beat the heat, Baloch rescheduled the practice to begin late in the evening — from 6pm to 9pm, for which she had to go to each family personally to allow their girls to come for the training. Even at that time, she said, “The heat continues to be unforgiving.” “Jacobabad refuses to cool down in the night and there is no wind,” pointed out Aqsa Shabbir, 17, another hockey player. And although she has an air conditioner in her home, she said it was nothing more than a “showpiece”, as they are without electricity for most of the night. “We never get a fitful night’s sleep.” Baloch said the city was witnessing unprecedented power outages and together with the high temperatures, it has meant the residents never get any respite to cool down. John Jacob, the British brigadier general, who the city is named after, described the wind as “a blast from the furnace” even at night. Ali’s home was without electricity for 15 days as their area transformer burst. “My father bought a solar panel on loan which generated enough electricity to light a bulb and a fan, but the strong winds ruined the glass on it and it does not work anymore,” she said. The late evening training has also come with its own set of social problems. Jannat Bibi, Jamali’s mother, who had given permission, grudgingly said it was getting tedious making excuses to the neighbours and relatives for her daughter’s absence from home or her coming home after dark. “Girls cannot venture out alone after dark,” she said, adding: “This sport cannot continue for much longer,” she said, worried that if word gets out, it may be difficult to find a “good” marriage proposal for her daughter later. “My father’s angry mood affects my performance, as I’m always tense about getting late,” Jamali said. “I wish my parents would be proud of my achievements, but all they are concerned about is what others are thinking,” she added irritably. Dur Bibi Brohi, a former hockey player, got married at 19 and never played after that. “That was the most beautiful time of my life,” reminisced the 23-year-old mother of two, thankful that her parents allowed her to travel out of the city and even out of the country for a few matches. “The few years that I played sports changed me from a shy and meek person to a more confident me; I wish more parents could be like mine and not let societal pressures dictate them,” she added. This is endorsed by Baloch. “Women get strong physically and mentally through sports,” she said, giving her own example. She said it “healed” her when she was in depression after she lost her only brother in a suicide bombing in 2015. “I was 25 and he was 23, and he was my best buddy.” She had already lost her father when she was four. And being in the sports arena helps her even now as a health carer for her mother, who is a cancer patient. Another challenge is their attire. “Initially, I felt shy playing in a T-shirt and track pants and kept pulling the shirt down as it showed off my thighs,” Jamali said. “Most girls find this dress code awkward, and it affects their concentration,” Baloch said. But Jamali realised she could not run as swiftly in the loose, long shirt with heavy embroidery on the front, baggy pants and chadar [big scarf] that she wears at home. “I have accepted the uniform,” she said, but makes sure she wears an abaya (a loose gown) over it when leaving her home to reach the sports ground. “Seeing me in Western attire on the street would create quite a scandal in the neighbourhood!” she said. A way out of all these barriers, said Baloch, would be a small ‘5-A side’ air-conditioned facility. “It will be the biggest support for women athletes in Jacobabad in the summer, which is long and unbearable here,” she said. In addition, Baloch also believed that if the government is serious about encouraging women to enter sports and play their best, they need continuous support in the form of a stipend to be able to manage their transport, nutrition and health needs. “I sometimes manage to get uniforms and shoes sponsored but this slapdash approach needs to stop,” she added.

  "description": "Eleven policemen were martyred and seven were injured as a result of an ambush by riverine dacoits in the Machka area of Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan on Thursday, police said. Bahawalpur Regional Police Officer (RPO) Rai Babar Saeed confirmed to Dawn.com that “11 personnel were martyred and seven were injured in the attack.” A statement from the Punjab police said that two police vans were returning from weekly duties in Rahim Yar Khan’s riverine Machka area when one of the vehicles developed a malfunction, after which sudden rocket attacks occurred. It added that the Rahim Yar Khan district police officer was present at the scene, while Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar took notice of the incident, requested a report from the Bahawalpur RPO, and proceeded to the location with several other senior police officials. The injured were transported for treatment, and the Punjab police chief ordered that they be provided with the best possible medical facilities.         Condemning the attack, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz vowed that it would not go “unavenged”. She said her team of officials was dispatched with “clear directions to sort them out decisively”.         “Sacrifices of police personnel will always be remembered,” she said, directing the authorities concerned to take immediate action to recover the missing policemen.   CM Maryam also sought an immediate report from IG Anwar on the matter. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack and extended his condolences to the families of the martyred police officers. The president emphasised the need for strict action against criminals in the riverine area and warned that attacks on personnel of police and law enforcement agencies would not be tolerated.         Condemning the attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered that “immediate and effective action” be taken against riverine bandits.         “The gruesome attack on Punjab police in riverine area is not only condemned as minister of interior but also as a patriotic Pakistani. The attack, which has resulted in a heavy loss of life, shows the unwavering commitment of the police force to fight with such a menace,” said Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.         Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon to contact the Punjab police and said any required assistance should be provided immediately. “Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan police should plan a joint operation against dacoits. Punjab police is as brave as Sindh police, both have always fought against terrorism and dacoits,” he said, adding that the Sindh government was ready to cooperate in every way if the injured policemen needed treatment. Meanwhile, a statement from Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar ordered that the provincial police remain on high alert until further orders amid the incident. “The morale of the officers and youths cannot be lowered by the martyrdom of the policemen,” he said. IG Memon said the “cowardly act is an attack on the common strategy and unity of the police force”. “It is a war of good and evil in which Punjab and Sindh police are working together,” he added. Earlier this month, three policemen were killed by riverine dacoits in an attack on a police check post at the river Indus protective spur near Bhong. After the attack, a police party began chasing the dacoits, and after an exchange of heavy firing, the police claimed to have recovered a body from a field, which was later identified as Samundar Indhar, a member of the notorious Indhar gang of dacoits. Last month, a police official was martyred while four dacoits were killed by the Punjab police during an operation in the Machka area. A statement from the Rahimyar Khan police spokesperson said that Machaka Station House Officer Sub-Inspector Mohammad Ramzan died from a heart attack during the operation while four dacoits of the Shar gang were gunned down. In April, a meeting of the Na­­ti­o­nal Action Plan Imple­m­e­ntation Review Com­mit­tee at the National Counter Terror­ism Auth­ority (Nacta) headquarters had decided to launch another joint operation against the notorious dacoits of Sindh’s riverine area. The interior minister had said that in order to eradicate terrorism, institutions would be equipped with modern technology while the federal government would provide all possible support to provinces in this regard.

  "description": "The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the Punjab government’s urgent application seeking omissions of certain portions from the court’s July 24 revised verdict in the Mubarak Sani case after taking input from scholars. The development came after a hearing on the Punjab government’s urgent request to omit specific sections from the judgment. On February 6, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, overturned the conviction of Ahmadi citizen Mubarak Sani, who had been accused under the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act of 2019. The court noted that the alleged offence had not been criminalised until 2021, leading to the decision to set aside Sani’s conviction and order his immediate release. However, the judgment was subsequently challenged by the Punjab government and other parties. On July 24, the Supreme Court accepted the review petitions and issued a revised order. Despite this, the Punjab government sought further amendments to the revised verdict after consulting with some clerics. Today, a three-member bench — led by CJP Isa and including Justices Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — took up the Punjab government’s August 17 petition. After hearing all the arguments from the parties involved — including clerics — the court announced its verdict and accepted the Punjab government’s application to omit certain sections from the previously revised judgement. The court also ordered that the expunged paragraphs not be used as judicial precedents in the future. The hearing Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman — one of the religious scholars who had requested the government to seek another review of the ruling — appeared before the court today. Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan was also present during the hearing, while prominent religious scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani appeared via video link. At the outset of the hearing, AGP Awan informed the bench that the Parliament and some clerics had asked the federal government to approach the SC regarding the matter. He further said that a letter was received from the NA speaker and directives were also issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Admitting that a “second review” of the original verdict could not be held, the AGP noted that the government, hence, had approached the court as per the Code of Civil Procedure. AGP Awan urged the court to hear the clerics’ arguments since the matter was a religious one. “I don’t want to say but am helpless; I pray in every prayer that may God prevent me from making any wrong decisions,” CJP Isa said. “A person is known by their actions and words,” he observed. The chief justice stressed that the Parliament’s words were highly respected by the court. The court then decided to seek assistance from clerics present in the courtroom, including Fazl, Mufti Sher Muhammad, Sahibzada Abul Khair Muhammad Zubair of the Milli Yakjehti Council, and Jamaat-i-Islami’s Fareed Paracha. CJP Isa then noted that the court had also sought assistance from Mufti Taqi Usmani but he was in Turkiye. Therefore, the scholar joined via video link. Mufti Muneebur Rehman’s representative was also present in the court. Mufti Taqi Usmani, in his arguments, urged the court to omit paragraphs 7 and 42 from the July 24 revised judgment. He pointed out what he said were “mistakes” in those paragraphs. Paragraph 42 of the judgment stated: “Details of the Constitutional and legal provisions and judicial precedents have proved that after declaring both groups of Ahmadis as non-Muslims, according to the constitution and law, they have the right to practice their religion and express and preach it, provided that they will neither use religious terms for Muslims in public nor present themselves as Muslims in public. “However, they have the right to ‘privacy of home’ in their houses, places of worship, and specific private institutions within ‘reasonable limits’ prescribed by law.”     Explaining his stance, the cleric said: “The term ‘tableegh’ (to preach) was used in paragraph 42, which meant that unconditional permission was granted.” Upon hearing that, CJP Isa read out section 298 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) which details punishment for a person who with the “deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings” of a person, “utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places any object in the sight of that person”. In response, Mufti Usmani pointed out that as per Section 298, “a non-Muslim was not allowed to preach while posing as a Muslim”. He said that since the Ahmadiyya community was “among the minority but do not identify themselves as non-Muslims”, section 298 of the PPC did not apply, therefore, paragraph 42 of the judgment needed to be omitted. “Taqi Usmani sahib, I apologise. I want to clarify that those who were issued notices had submitted many documents to us. If we had reviewed them in detail, then perhaps an entire book would have been made out of that decision,” the CJP said in his response to Usmani. “I could not review all those documents, which is my mistake. Point out the mistakes and your objections to the court order to us. If we do not understand something, we will ask,” the top judge added. Justice Isa observed that Pakistan was an Islamic republic, hence the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) ahadith were referred to in court orders. “I am not above any mistake,” CJP Isa acknowledged. He observed that “lengthy verdicts” were needed to be written in such matters. The top judge highlighted that the Feb 6 decision was “now left behind” after the court reviewed it. “Now we must look ahead,” he said. “My stance is that we usually give examples of America and Britain [so] why should we not give our own?” the chief justice asked. “If someone does not appear for a matriculation exam, he also does not risk failing in it,” he remarked. In response, Mufti Usmani said, “You should have given more time to the real issue than the issues decided in the order.” Meanwhile, in his arguments, Maulana Fazl noted that the court had so far held “many hearings” and now was having a “review” of its decision. At this, Justice Isa pointed out that it was not a “review”, to which the JUI-F chief replied that it was a “third view” of the court’s decision. Fazl highlighted that various scholars and the CII had come forward with their opinions against the SC’s ruling. Noting that Fazl had used the plural form of “decision”, CJP Isa asked him if there were more verdicts under consideration. To this, Fazl asked the court to ignore the use of the plural. “Now at the age of 72, I am standing before a court for the first time,” the JUI-F chief noted, noting that ’God had kept him “safe from courts”. “We are not that bad,” the chief justice quipped in response. Fazl then lamented that while it was discussed in the public sphere that Ahmadis were referred to as non-Muslims, “what they (Ahmadis) say is not talked about”. “We do not want to create any issues for non-Muslims in Pakistan.” At this point during the hearing, KP Chief Khatib Maulana Tayyab Qureshi said he agreed with the opinions voiced by other clerics before him. He contended that the Ahmadiyya community has modelled its interpretation in the manner of “minor Muslims”, claiming that “any common Muslim could not differentiate between their and [the Ahmadiyyas’] interpretations”. “Muslims are hurt, please satisfy them,” Qureshi said, requesting the court to implement the suggestions put forward by clerics. The KP chief khatib also invited CJP Isa to visit Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, at which the judge asked if it was located at Chowk Yadgar. “During the Pakistan Movement, my father had given his best speech at Chowk Yadgar,” the chief justice highlighted. “My father says the entire crowd was against the Muslim League but after the speech, everyone chanted ‘Quaid-i-Azam’,” he added. In his arguments, Sahibzada Abul Khair Muhammad Zubair also urged the court to omit paragraph 42 from the revised ruling. Senior lawyer Latif Khosa then appeared before the court and requested that his and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza’s names be added to the list of respondents as well. “We are representing the parliamentary committee and the Parliament,” Khosa said. “Khosa sahib, the Parliament can even strike down court orders. You may go to the Parliament to exercise your right,” CJP Isa quipped, in an apparent reference to recent amendments to election laws that would take precedence over court orders. The court then announced a break during the hearing, following which the verdict was given. Case background Following the court’s February 6 judgment that overturned Sani’s conviction, the top judge had faced vehement criticism from certain sections of society. Members of a politico-religious outfit attempted to incite people to violence against the chief justice, leading to what the government and the legal community termed a “malicious and slanderous campaign” against him. The criticism had even prompted the Supreme Court to issue a clarification.      The verdict was subsequently challenged by the Punjab government on the grounds that paragraph 9, regarding Article 20 of the Constitution, needed to be modified as the rights of the citizens as envisaged under the provision were not absolute and instead subject to law, public order, and morality. While accepting the review pleas filed by the Punjab government and other individuals, the Supreme Court on July 24 reportedly declared that the right to profess religion and religious freedom, as ensured by the Constitution, was subject to law, morality, and public order. The judgment had emphasised that complete faith in the finality of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) was the very foundation of Islam — a belief without which nobody can be described as a Muslim. However, earlier this month, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) expressed its reservations over several reasons given in the SC’s second judgment. Expressing the hope that the SC “will soon review its decision”, the CII had urged the government to play an effective role in the matter. Various groups, including religio-political parties, had voiced their objections by carrying out rallies and even breaching the apex court’s security as they held protests.      The matter came under discussion in the National Assembly by both the treasury and opposition benches, while the KP Assembly had also unanimously passed a resolution expressing concern over the SC verdict. On August 17, the Punjab government filed an application seeking corrections that some clerics deemed were needed in the SC’s July 24 ruling. According to the petition, some leading clerics and members of parliament requested the federal government to approach SC and highlight some portions of the verdict that they said merited correction. The application explained that some observations and findings contained in some other paragraphs of the judgment appeared to be an accidental error and contrary to the precedents as mentioned by the top court. The three-page application mentioned that paragraph 49 needed omission and correction since the July 24 judgment had held that the verdict of the Federal Shariat Court in the 1985 case of Mujibur Rehman versus the Government of Pakistan, and the Supreme Court’s 1993 verdict in Zaheeruddin versus the State case were binding precedents and that the apex court had not deviated from these binding precedents in its Feb 6 judgment.

  "description": "Two girls were killed while five children and a man were injured when unknown men opened fire at a school van in Attock District’s Dheri Kot area on Thursday, police and rescue officials said. “Two children were killed and five children were injured when gunmen indiscriminately opened fire on a school van,” Attock police spokesman Waseem Babar told AFP. The gunmen, who fled the scene, were embroiled in court cases with the family of the driver, who was also hurt in the shooting, according to Babar. The girls killed were aged 10 or 11, Babar said. The children were on their way to school when the attack happened around 8am. The Attock police reached the site of the incident while the injured and the bodies were shifted to a hospital. Regional Police Officer (RPO) Babar Sarfraz Alpa said the incident occurred due to “personal enmity”. “The gunfire was aimed at the driver but also caused harm to the children,” the RPO said. He added that a case had been registered against the suspects and raids were being carried out to arrest them. RPO Sarfraz said he hoped the culprits would be arrested soon. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Condemnations pour in President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the incident and said that strict action must be taken against those responsible, according to a statement from the President’s House. “Targeting innocent children is a cruel and shameful act,” the statement read. He prayed for the deceased, as well as for the speedy recovery of the injured children. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said such an attack on children was “a cruel and gruesome act”, Radio Pakistan reported. Expressing solidarity with the bereaved families, the premier prayed for the departed souls and early recovery of the injured. He also directed the authorities concerned to take stern action against the culprits and to provide the best treatment facilities to the injured children. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi conveyed his sympathies to the bereaved families, a statement shared by state broadcaster PTV News said.         Praying for the injured children to get well soon, he said that those “targeting innocent children did not deserve to be called human beings”. “The shooting incident on children inside the school van is a monstrosity. Those exhibiting barbarism are not entitled to any concession,” Naqvi asserted. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz sought a report on the incident from Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar, according to a statement issued by her public relations officer. She expressed deep grief over the death of the two students and directed that the best treatment facilities be provided to the injured. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also condemned the attack, calling for the “strictest possible action” against the perpetrators, PTV News reported.         PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said his “heart was crying tears of blood” after hearing about the deaths of the children. “Those with the blood of students on their hands are beasts,” the PPP MNA said in a statement shared by his party on X.         Bilawal said he stood with the bereaved families and prayed for them to have patience. He also expressed the hope that proper treatment of the injured children and the driver would be ensured. While incidents of gun violence targeting children are uncommon in the country, the recent shooting was not an isolated case. Last year, a student was killed and six others as well as a teacher were inj­ured when a cop posted outside a school suddenly opened fire at a van in the Sangota area of Swat. In October 2022, unidentified armed men riding a motorcycle opened fire on a school van in Swat’s Char Bagh area, killing the driver and injuring a child. According to the police, 15 students were inside the vehicle at the time of the attack. On December 16, 2014, 147 students and staff members of the Army Public School (APS) Peshawar were martyred in a gun attack by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants. In 2012, education activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai’s school bus was attacked by the TTP. While Yousafzai was the prime target, other children riding with her in the van had also sustained injuries. "

  "description": "A Lahore district court on Thursday handed over anchorperson Orya Maqbool Jan to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on a four-day physical remand for his social media posts related to the Mubarak Sani case. Jan was arrested by the FIA’s cybercrime wing and detained in its Gulberg office in Lahore earlier today, his lawyer confirmed, adding that he would be presented later in court today. During the hearing, the FIA requested the judicial magistrate for a 14-day physical remand of the anchorperson. Jan’s lawyer, Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, however, argued that his client had not insulted anyone and a “false and baseless claim” had been registered against him by the FIA. The lawyer added that the agency had no evidence for their claim and called for the court to discharge his client from the case. The FIA investigation officer (IO), on the other hand, stated that the allegations against Jan were true and that the anchorperson was not cooperating during the investigation. “We have concrete evidence,” the IO said. The anchorperson, after coming to the rostrum, said that he had sent the FIA all the passwords of his social media accounts. “Have I stolen someone’s car that needs to be recovered,” he said. After hearing arguments from both sides, Judicial Magistrate Imran Abid approved a four-day remand for the anchorperson and ordered the IO to submit an investigation report. Mubarak Sani case On February 6, a two-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, overturned the conviction of Mubarak Sani, who was accused of an offence in 2019 under the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act. In its judgement, the court noted that the offence that the defendant had been accused of was not criminalised till 2021. Consequently, the apex court set aside the conviction and ordered the immediate release of the petitioner.      This led to what the government and the legal community termed a “malicious and slanderous campaign” against the CJP, even prompting the Supreme Court to issue a clarification. While accepting review pleas filed by the Punjab government and other individuals, the Supreme Court on July 24 reportedly declared that the right to profess religion and religious freedom, as ensured by the Constitution, was subject to law, morality, and public order. Today, the Supreme Court accepted a fresh urgent application filed by the Punjab government seeking omissions of certain portions from the court’s July 24 revised verdict. "

  "description": "A Lahore district court on Thursday extended the physical remand of a man by four more days for his alleged role in fuelling the recent anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant riots in the UK through disinformation.      The suspect was initially taken into custody by Lahore police and later handed over to the FIA cybercrime wing which presented the suspect before a magistrate and sought his physical remand for investigation. On Wednesday, a judicial magistrate allowed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) one-day physical custody of Farhan Asif, who was suspected of uploading a misleading news article on the website of Channel3Now. The investigating officer had told the court that a case was registered against the suspect under the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (Peca) 2016. Today, while hearing the case, the judicial magistrate extended the remand of the suspect by four more days and ordered for him to be produced again after the stipulated time. The agency’s lawyer argued that evidence from the suspect needed to be recovered and an investigation into his posts on X was to be carried out.      The lawyer asked Judge Imran Abid for an extension which was subsequently granted by the court. More than a week after the kingdom witnessed widespread riots in the aftermath of the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport, law enforcement agencies began probing claims that the disinformation originated from a website with a footprint in Pakistan. Reports aired by UK media identified little-known platform Channel3Now as the source of the disinformation that claimed the British-born 17-year-old suspect was a Muslim immigrant who had arrived in the UK on a boat. However, UK broadcaster ITV News asserted that a Pakistani individual was the originator of the false news story. "

  "description": "Pakistan’s Ambassador-designate to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, assumed responsibilities for his new assignment on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP). The Foreign Office announced Sheikh’s appointment as the new ambassador to the United States in June, as well as Asim Iftikhar as Pakistan’s additional permanent representative to the United Nations in New York. The replacement of the envoy in Washington DC was long overdue. The previous ambassador, Masood Khan, had already received a three-month extension after his contract ended in March. According to APP, Sheikh said his top priorities would be cementing the relationship between Pakistan and the US, strengthening economic ties, and enhancing people-to-people contacts. Speaking to the mission officers, Sheikh underscored the importance of the Pakistani community in the US, describing them as a valuable asset in the country. He added that the community served as a strong bond in the Pakistan-US relationship, and every possible effort should be made to ensure better service delivery to the community. In this regard, the envoy stressed the need to pursue result-oriented diplomacy. On his arrival in Washington on Tuesday, the Ambassador was received at the airport by officials of the US State Department and the Pakistani embassy. "

  "description": "Several users were sharing posts on social media platform X on Sunday, claiming that PTI leader Shahbaz Gill was dismissed following a harassment complaint from a student of Columbia University or the country of Colombia. However, he has never had any association with the university and there is no evidence for the alleged development. Gill served as the spokesperson for the Punjab government during the PTI tenure and as a special assistant to the prime minister. On August 9, 2022, Gill was arrested on sedition charges for allegedly attempting to incite Pakistani army officers to revolt. He now resides in the United States and continues to campaign for the PTI. On Sunday, an X user, a PML-N supporter based on his past posts and account bio, shared a photo of Gill with the caption, “Shahbaz Gill dismissed from an American university following complaints from a student of Columbia/Colombia. Attempts are being made for an out-of-court settlement to avoid legal action.” The post gained over 58,000 views. Azhar Syed, editor-in-chief at paknews.co as per his X bio, also shared a similar post, racking up over 29,000 views. Notably, the link to paknews.co leads to a dead website. Posts with the same or similar claim widely shared as can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here. Notably, none of the posts specified whether they were referring to a student of Columbia University or a student from the country of Colombia. They also did not present any other supporting details such as the date of the alleged occurrence. A fact check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality, the alarming nature of the allegation against the PTI leader who is very publicly active in campaigning for the party in the United States, as well as public interest in the matter. According to the bio of Gill’s X account, he is a professor at the University of Illinois. According to a now-defunct profile of his at the university’s Gies College of Business, accessed through an archived link dated September 30, 2022, Gill’s association with the University of Illinois began in 2010. He began working as the clinical assistant professor of business administration at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus in 2019.     A media repository for the University of Illinois also features a video of Gill introducing himself as a lecturer at the institution. Meanwhile, a keyword search for “Shahbaz Gill” and “Columbia University” yielded no results and neither did the the list of faculty members on Columbia University’s website mention his name. Furthermore, no news reports were found from any media outlets in the US that mentioned remotely anything similar to a harassment case against Gill by a student from Columbia University or the country of Colombia. When contacted for a response, Gill said: “Never had an association with Columbia. Fake tweet.” He also directed to an August 21 post on his X account responding to the PML-N supporter’s post, saying: “If you had googled before concocting the lie, you would have found out that I never worked at Columbia.”         Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim regarding PTI leader Shahbaz Gill being dismissed over a harassment complaint from a student of Columbia University or the country of Colombia is false. No evidence was found for the alleged development in the US press and Gill has never had any association with Columbia University.  This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ and UNDP. "

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Amid growing contentions between the two key ruling allies — the Pakistan Peoples Parties (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the top leaders of the two parties including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal-Bhutto Zaddari sat together in Islamabad on Thursday to iron out differences.    Sources told Geo News that the coalition government led by PM Shehbaz took the PPP leadership into confidence ahead of \"crucial legislation\" in the National Assembly.  In this regard, the sources said a session of the National Assembly will be convened on Monday for the \"crucial legislation\".  Without divulging details of the upcoming legislation, the insiders said the two sides also discussed the prevailing political situation in the country and various key issues. The PPP delegation led by party chairman Bilawal consisted of Senator Sherry Rehman, former National Assembly speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and MNA Naveed Qamar. From the PML-N side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and PM's aide on public and political affairs Rana Sanaullah attended the huddle.  Sources said that PPP shared various concerns with PM Shehbaz, including the non-implementation of written agreement regarding power-sharing formula in Punjab. \"PPP is constantly being ignored in the Punjab government,\" the sources cited one of the objections raised during the meeting. They said that a meeting of the PML-N and PPP's coordination committees has been called at Punjab Governor House on Sunday (August 25), where the issues between the two parties will be resolved. Speaking on Geo News show 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath' earlier today, PM’s aide Sanaullah confirmed the meeting between PM Shehbaz and Bilawal. “All issues were discussed with the PPP,” he said adding that the premier will meet the PPP chief again next week. Sanaullah further claimed that most of the issues with the PPP have been resolved. “There will be a meeting with the PPP next week to make progress on some issues,” the PML-N leader added. It may be noted that the two political allies have been at odds for quite sometime over the issue of federal budget, power subsidy among others.  The most recent was the exchange of harsh words between PPP and PML-N on the issue of latter's power relief in Punjab. The sources earlier said that Bilawal was likely convey the party’s concerns and reservations on the PML-N government’s economic policies to the prime minister.  As per the sources, the party's concerns included Centre's \"excuses\" based on \"strict conditions\" by International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the matter of providing subsidies and relief for the people, while Punjab provided relief to its masses at the same time. Moreover, provision of cheap electricity to the people of Sindh through using coal which is abundant in Thar was also one of the party's concerns. After the February 8 general elections, the PPP formed government in Sindh and announced its support for PML-N in formation of the government in Centre and Punjab but refused to accept the ministries."

  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: At least 12 policemen were martyred and six sustained injuries after kacha bandits attacked their vans with rockets in a riverine area of Punjab's Rahim Yar Khan on Thursday. The horrific attack occurred in the Machka area located in one of Rahim Yar Khan's riverine areas. Police officials told the media that two police vans with more than 20 cops were trapped in rainwater in the locality when bandits launched rockets at them.   As a result of the fierce attack, a dozen cops were martyred while seven others were wounded and five went missing, the police added. They said that the wounded cops were immediately shifted to the hospital where one of the wounded officials succumbed to his wounds, taking the death toll to 12.  According to the police, the missing five policemen were safely rescued. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the dacoits' attack on Punjab police and paid tribute to the martyred cops. He also prayed for the early recovery of the wounded policemen and pledged that the government would stand beside the families of the martyred cops. In a statement, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of police personnel saying that the sacrifices of the cops will always be remembered.  She directed the authorities concerned to take immediate action to recover the missing policemen. The chief minister also sought a report from the Punjab Police Inspector General (IG) Dr Usman Anwar on the Rahim Yar Khan incident besides directing to provide the best medical aid to the injured police officials. Following her directives, the Punjab police chief, Additional IG Special Branch, Additional IG Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and other relevant officers left for Rahim Yar Khan, as per the statement. Bandit groups in riverine areas have always been a hurdle in maintaining law and order for the provincial governments in Sindh and Punjab despite conducting multiple operations to eliminate them. A National Action Plan implementation review committee decided in a meeting at the National Counter Terror­ism Auth­ority (Nacta) headquarters in April to launch a joint operation of Sindh and Punjab police forces against notorious dacoits of the kacha areas in Sindh. The directives were issued by Interior Minister Naqvi who chaired the high-level meeting attended by the interior secretary, heads of Nacta and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), police chiefs of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) and provincial home secretaries."

  "content": "After the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) called off its Islamabad rally scheduled to be held today, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur distributed Rs5,000 each among party workers and supporters who came to attend the much-hyped public gathering. Jailed PTI founder Imran Khan had directed the party leaders to hold a power show in the federal capital on August 22, according to the Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif. Addressing a press conference on August 18, Saif had said, \"We guarantee that there will be no law and order issue.\"   However, the district administration revoked the no-objection certificate (NOC) granted to the party on the “report of the district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement. However, despite the revocation of the NOC, the party had decided to go ahead with its decision to hold the public gathering in the Tarnol area of Islamabad. In view of security concerns, the Islamabad Capital Territory’s (ICT) administration blocked roads at different entry points of the city with shipping containers to prevent the party from holding the rally. As party activists were arriving at a point in Swabi earlier today, the opposition party cancelled the much-hyped gathering. The workers were distributed Rs5,000 each as they dispersed. Accompanied by PTI leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur distributed cash among the party supporters and activists.  When contacted over the cash distribution, Barrister Saif responded, saying that there is no specific reason behind the cash disbursement as the KP's chief minister is a well-wisher of the poor and he distributed money from his pocket. Gandapur, sources said, wanted to hold the public gathering at all costs, adding that he and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser had decided to reach Islamabad under all circumstances. However, the Islamabad administration has now issued a permit to the party to stage a rally on September 8. A notification has also been issued by the district magistrate of Islamabad for the purpose. "

  "content": "  Expressing a lack of confidence in the current leadership of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Aleema Khan — the sister of party founder Imran Khan — has claimed that they have no \"real intention\" of freeing the former prime minister from jail.  The statement came hours after the former ruling party put off its today's public gathering in Islamabad and rescheduled it for September 8 as the local administration revoked the no-objection certificate (NOC) and sealed roads leading to the federal capital.  PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said that the notification about the postponement of the rally had been issued and it would now be held on September 8, as per instruction of Imran Khan. A short audio clip, purportedly featuring the voice of Aleema Khan, is doing rounds on social media, expressing dismay over the postponement of the rally.  She questioned why Azam Swati, a senior PTI leader, paid a visit to Imran early in the morning and who instructed him to do so. “Who instructed him [Swati] to meet Khan at 7am and deliver a message regarding the rally’s postponement.”   Aleema further said that why they were consulting the PTI founder, who is currently incarcerated at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, criticising the current leadership for lacking the courage to make decisions. She alleged that the present PTI leadership has no real intention of freeing the former premier from jail and “is using his name while making decisions independently”.  Her remarks were the latest in a series of broadsides launched against the present PTI leadership.  Earlier, former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry had said there was \"no chance\" of the incarcerated party founder’s release in the presence of the current PTI leadership.  “[Due to] lack of political strategy of current PTI leadership, all of us are suffering,\" said the former senior vice-president of the party, who parted with Imran following May 9 violent protests that saw attacks on public and military installations.  The former federal minister had said Barrister Gohar-led party's leaders only doing commentary on verdicts of different cases against jailed party leaders. He was of the view that “eligible” politicians like Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pervaiz Elahi, and Asad Qaiser should lead the party. Fawad, who is also a lawyer, urged the top PTI leaders to stop “foolish talks” expecting the early release of the PTI founder as a result of the court battles."

  "content": "  Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on Thursday cautioned a delegation of students from Harvard Business School (HBS) Trek-2024 against the perils of misinformation and fake news in the digital age, urging them to navigate this landscape with discernment, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The students' delegation representing 9 different countries met the army chief at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the military's media wing said. Notably, the COAS’s statement comes a day after his address to the Pakistan National Youth Convention 2024 on Wednesday. During the convention, he said that it was the state’s responsibility to protect its people from the adverse effects of the dangers of social media. He further addressed the youth present at the gathering and said: “Youth is the most important and expensive asset to Pakistan and we will not let anyone waste it at any cost. I can see in their bright eyes that Pakistan’s future is in safe hands.” Additionally, the COAS emphasised the need for a holistic youth development, encompassing engagement, education, and entertainment. In the statement today, the ISPR said the session for the Harvard students “provided a platform to share perspectives on Pakistan's pivotal role in promoting regional peace and stability, its unwavering efforts against terrorism, and its commitment to upholding democratic values”. The army chief emphasised the significance of education, critical thinking, and innovation in addressing contemporary security challenges.  Furthermore, Gen Munir highlighted Pakistan's vast potential and encouraged the attendees to form their own opinions based on personal experiences, the army’s media wing added. The Harvard students expressed their gratitude to the COAS for facilitating a constructive and enlightening interaction.  This engagement follows the COAS's earlier interaction with students from various universities at the GHQ on August 20, underscoring his commitment to nurturing and inspiring the nation's youth, the ISPR added."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has approved the federal government’s appeal to expunge controversial paras from the contentious Mubarak Sani case verdict. A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, on Thursday (today) heard the Centre's plea alongside the Punjab government’s petition seeking amendments to the top court verdict of February 6. The apex court had overturned the conviction of sacrilege accused Sani, who sought deletion of certain charges framed against him in the case filed under Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act. In its judgment, the court had noted that the offence that the defendant had been accused of was not criminalised till 2021. Consequently, the apex court set aside the conviction and ordered the immediate release of the petitioner. After the verdict, the provincial government filed a review petition on the SC verdict under Article 188 of the Constitution, but on July 24 the top court declared it did not deviate in any way from the decisions of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court, in approving the bail of the sacrilege accused. The verdict favouring Sani drew outrage among religious circles, and a debate in the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Law and Justice where both the treasury and opposition benches agreed that the federal government file a petition in the Supreme Court.  Besides the Punjab government's plea seeking omissions of certain portions from the court’s July 24 revised verdict, the Centre also filed a miscellaneous plea on August 17 as per Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directives. The Punjab government in its petition maintained that some leading clerics and members of parliament requested the federal government to approach the top court and highlight some portions of the verdict that they said merited correction.  It further maintained that certain conclusions and observations made in other parts of the judgment seem to be a mistake and inconsistent with previous rulings of the highest court. Jamiat Ulema-e-Isfam Fazl's Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani of Jamia Darul Uloom Karachi among the other religious scholars, who requested the federal government for approaching the apex court, attended today's hearing. In the short verdict, the top court said the paras excluded from the verdict cannot be cited as precedent in any judgment.    At the outset of the hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Usman Awan informed the court that parliament and certain religious leaders had urged the federal government to approach the top court on the matter again after the July 24 verdict.  While acknowledging that a \"second review\" of the original verdict was not possible, the AGP noted that the government had approached the court in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. During the hearing, CJ Isa remarked: \"If we make a mistake, it should be corrected.\" The top judge apologised to Mufti Usmani, who attended the hearing virtually via video link, for not being able to view all the documents provided to the court by those who were served notices. He then asked the cleric to identify the \"mistakes\" and \"objections\" in the verdict.  \"Our country is a Islamic state where references to Quran and Hadith are made in the judicial decisions. I am not immune to making any mistake\", CJP Isa stated. Approving the provincial government's plea, the apex court decided to take assistance from Usmani, Fazl and other religious scholars on the matter. Addressing the court, Mufti Usmani requested to expunge two paragraphs, no 7 and no 42, from the July 24 revised verdict and amend the part where the court accepted to omit the charges against the accused. Paragraph 42 stated: “Details of the Constitutional and legal provisions and judicial precedents have proved that after declaring both groups of Ahmadis as non-Muslims, according to the Constitution and law, they have the right to practice their religion and express and preach it, provided that they will neither use religious terms for Muslims in public nor present themselves as Muslims in public. “However, they have the right to ‘privacy of home’ in their houses, places of worship, and specific private institutions within ‘reasonable limits’ prescribed by law.” Mufti Usmani, while explaining his stance, maintained that the term \"tableegh\" (to preach) was used in paragraph 42, which meant that \"unconditional permission was granted\" to Sani. When summoned to the rostrum, Fazl also supported Mufti Usmani's requests and called for revision of the entire Supreme Court verdict. \"If you think Mubarak Sani deserves to be bailed then it is a different matter but all charges must be retained against his blasphemous actions,\" Fazl said while addressing the top judge. He said Sani's trial should continue as per the the Council of Islamic Ideology's (CII) recommendation. The court, after hearing opinion of various religious scholars who attended the proceedings, announced the decision to omit certain paras in admission to the recommendations of the CII and scholars' opinion, and stated that the expunged paras \"will not be cited as precedent \" in any future verdict. It also directed the trial court to review the sections imposed against Sani in the light of law. Talking to the media after the hearing, Fazl welcomed the SC's verdict and lauded CJP Isa for his \"positive attitude\" while hearing the matter. He said that the apex court deleted all the controversial clauses from its previous verdict. Fazl congratulated the religious groups on the favourable verdict and announced observing Friday (August 23) as 'thanksgiving day' to celebrate the verdict top court's judgment. "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Referring to the economic challenges, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday he would soon announce a five-year homegrown economic programme for the revival of the national economy. \"The ‘Home-Grown Economic Program’ would envisage measures to boost the country's economy by uplifting agriculture, information technology and other untapped sectors,\" the prime minister said, addressing the launching ceremony of the Buna-Raast connectivity project in Islamabad. He said broad parameters for the programme had already been finalised through months-long deliberations with the stakeholders.  \"Great work has gone into it. By next week or so, we will finalise it. I will go to the people to announce the programme for the next five years,\" he remarked. Highlighting the challenges of reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and power sector, Shehbaz said he was personally monitoring the FBR’s digitisation and that the government was hopeful of positive outcomes of power sector reforms. \"There is no magic wand. It is all about hard work, sacrifice, blood and sweat. Insha Allah, you will see we will have dividends and will find our place in the comity of nations through hard work, hard work and hard work,\" he said. Under the Buna-Raast connectivity project, the Raast payment mechanism is being linked with the Arab Monetary Fund’s (AMF) Buna system to facilitate millions of overseas Pakistanis in Arab countries to send remittances through a swift, affordable and effective mechanism. The prime minister said that besides easing the remittance-sending process digitally, it would also help boost the country’s foreign exchange and further strengthen the already cordial relations between Pakistan and the Arab world. Calling it a great step forward in promoting financial transactions through modern techniques, he said the project would expand the reach of Pakistan’s digital payment infrastructure. \"This signifies how 21st-century Pakistan is moving ahead by augmenting modern technologies in the people's lives. This is the first cross-border real-time payment system linkage that will make remittances more affordable and accessible,\" he said. Moreover, PM Shehbaz said that the project also held the potential to accelerate the connectivity into a future model of a wider payment system where transactions would take place from region to region with a potential of over $20 billion in annual payments. He thanked the AFM, State Bank of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Karandaaz for their support in launching the project. Earlier, he also gave away the mementos to AMF Chairperson Dr Fahad Alturki, SBP Governor Jamil Ahmed, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation President Dr Anita Zaidi, and Karandaaz CEO Waqasul Hassan. In his remarks, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that macroeconomic stability was taking root in Pakistan’s economy as manifested by reduced current account deficit, stable currency, improved foreign reserves, upgraded sovereign ratings, and reviving investors' confidence. He said the government was committed to infrastructural reforms and that its efforts were bearing fruits, though a lot more was yet to be done. The remittances were on the surge with $3 billion received in July, he added. About the Buna-Raast connectivity project, he said the digitalisation would help bring transparency and reduce leakages in remittances, taxation and the power sectors. He said the project would put the country on a sustainable path and on the right side of the FATF. Zaidi said the project would link the economies of Pakistan and the Arab world digitally, boost productivity and bring efficiency to systems. Besides, it will also improve individuals' lives making it cheaper to send money and improve families’ economic condition as 90% of remittance receivers were women. She viewed that the project would facilitate, particularly women entrepreneurs enabling them to sell their goods and receive money digitally."

  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: Bandits in kacha area of Rahim Yar Khan carried out fierce rocket attack on police vans in a riverine area on Thursday, leaving at least 12 policemen martyred and six injured. The horrific attack occurred in the Machka area located in one of Rahim Yar Khan's riverine areas. Police officials told the media that two police vans with more than 20 cops were trapped in rainwater in the locality when bandits launched rockets at them.   As a result of the fierce attack, a dozen cops were martyred while seven others were wounded and five went missing, the police added. They said that the wounded cops were immediately shifted to the hospital where one of the wounded officials succumbed to his wounds, taking the death toll to 12. According to the police, the missing five policemen were safely rescued. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the dacoits' attack on Punjab police and paid tribute to the martyred cops.  He also prayed for the early recovery of the wounded policemen and pledged that the government would stand beside the families of the martyred cops. In a statement, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of police personnel saying that the sacrifices of the cops will always be remembered.  She directed the authorities concerned to take immediate action to recover the missing policemen. The chief minister also sought a report from the Punjab Police Inspector General (IG) Dr Usman Anwar on the Rahim Yar Khan incident besides directing to provide the best medical aid to the injured police officials. Following her directives, the Punjab police chief, Additional IG Special Branch, Additional IG Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and other relevant officers left for Rahim Yar Khan, as per the statement. Bandit groups in riverine areas have always been a hurdle in maintaining law and order for the provincial governments in Sindh and Punjab despite conducting multiple operations to eliminate them. A National Action Plan implementation review committee decided in a meeting at the National Counter Terror­ism Auth­ority (Nacta) headquarters in April to launch a joint operation of Sindh and Punjab police forces against notorious dacoits of the kacha areas in Sindh. The directives were issued by Interior Minister Naqvi who chaired the high-level meeting attended by the interior secretary, heads of Nacta and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), police chiefs of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) and provincial home secretaries."

  "content": "After the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) postponed its much-hyped rally, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur doled out cash among the political workers who gathered in Swabi to move to Islamabad where the former ruling party was slated to hold a public gathering. Jailed PTI founder Imran Khan had directed the party leaders to hold a power show in the federal capital on August 22, according to the Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif. Addressing a press conference on August 18, Saif had said, \"We guarantee that there will be no law and order issue.\" However, the district administration revoked the no-objection certificate (NOC) granted to the party on the “report of the district intelligence committee,” according to an official statement. However, despite the revocation of the NOC, the party had decided to go ahead with its decision to hold the public gathering in the Tarnol area of Islamabad. In view of security concerns, the Islamabad Capital Territory’s (ICT) administration blocked roads at different entry points of the city with shipping containers to prevent the party from holding the rally. As party activists were arriving at a point in Swabi earlier today, the opposition party cancelled the much-hyped gathering. The workers were distributed Rs5,000 each as they dispersed. Accompanied by PTI leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur distributed cash among the party supporters and activists. When contacted over the cash distribution, Barrister Saif responded, saying that there is no specific reason behind the cash disbursement as the KP's chief minister is a well-wisher of the poor and he distributed money from his pocket. Gandapur, sources said, wanted to hold the public gathering at all costs, adding that he and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser had decided to reach Islamabad under all circumstances. However, the Islamabad administration has now issued a permit to the party to stage a rally on September 8. A notification has also been issued by the district magistrate of Islamabad for the purpose. "

The military's media wing said that the students' delegation representing 9 different countries met the army chief at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. Notably, the COAS’s statement comes a day after his address to the Pakistan National Youth Convention 2024 on Wednesday. During the convention, he said that it was the state’s responsibility to protect its people from the adverse effects of the dangers of social media. He further addressed the youth present at the gathering and said: “Youth is the most important and expensive asset to Pakistan and we will not let anyone waste it at any cost. I can see in their bright eyes that Pakistan’s future is in safe hands.” Additionally, the COAS emphasised the need for a holistic youth development, encompassing engagement, education, and entertainment. In the statement today, the ISPR said the session for the Harvard students “provided a platform to share perspectives on Pakistan's pivotal role in promoting regional peace and stability, its unwavering efforts against terrorism, and its commitment to upholding democratic values”. The army chief emphasised the significance of education, critical thinking, and innovation in addressing contemporary security challenges. Furthermore, Gen Munir highlighted Pakistan's vast potential and encouraged the attendees to form their own opinions based on personal experiences, the army’s media wing added. The Harvard students expressed their gratitude to the COAS for facilitating a constructive and enlightening interaction.

  "content": "Aleema Khan, the sister of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, castigated the current party leadership, saying they have no \"real intention\" of securing the former prime minister’s release.  The remarks came in response to PTI’s decision to put off its today's public gathering in Islamabad and reschedule it for September 8 as the local administration cancelled the no-objection certificate (NOC) and sealed roads leading to the federal capital. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan confirmed the development and said the public gathering would now be held on September 8, as per the instruction of Imran Khan.  A short audio clip, purportedly featuring the voice of Aleema Khan, is making rounds on social media, expressing disappointment over the postponement of the rally. She questioned the visit of Azam Swati, a senior PTI leader, to Imran early in the morning and asked: “Who instructed him [Swati] to meet Khan at 7am and deliver a message regarding the rally’s postponement.” Aleema further said that why they were consulting the PTI founder, who is currently incarcerated at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, criticising the current leadership for lacking the courage to make decisions. She alleged that the present PTI leadership has no real intention of freeing the former premier from jail and “is using his name while making decisions independently”.   Her remarks were the latest in a series of broadsides launched against the present PTI leadership. Earlier, former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry had said there was \"no chance\" of the incarcerated party founder’s release in the presence of the current PTI leadership. “[Due to] lack of political strategy of current PTI leadership, all of us are suffering,\" said the former senior vice-president of the party, who parted with Imran following May 9 violent protests that saw attacks on public and military installations. The former federal minister had said Barrister Gohar-led party's leaders only doing commentary on verdicts of different cases against jailed party leaders. He was of the view that “eligible” politicians like Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pervaiz Elahi, and Asad Qaiser should lead the party. Fawad, who is also a lawyer, urged the top PTI leaders to stop “foolish talks” expecting the early release of the PTI founder as a result of the court battles. "

In the short verdict, the top court said the paras excluded from the verdict cannot be cited as precedent in any judgment.    At the outset of the hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Usman Awan informed the court that parliament and certain religious leaders had urged the federal government to approach the top court on the matter again after the July 24 verdict. While acknowledging that a \"second review\" of the original verdict was not possible, the AGP noted that the government had approached the court in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. During the hearing, CJ Isa remarked: \"If we make a mistake, it should be corrected.\" The top judge apologised to Mufti Usmani, who attended the hearing virtually via video link, for not being able to view all the documents provided to the court by those who were served notices. He then asked the cleric to identify the \"mistakes\" and \"objections\" in the verdict. \"Our country is a Islamic state where references to Quran and Hadith are made in the judicial decisions. I am not immune to making any mistake\", CJP Isa stated. Approving the provincial government's plea, the apex court decided to take assistance from Usmani, Fazl and other religious scholars on the matter. Addressing the court, Mufti Usmani requested to expunge two paragraphs, no 7 and no 42, from the July 25 revised verdict and amend the part where the court accepted to omit the charges against the accused. Paragraph 42 stated: “Details of the Constitutional and legal provisions and judicial precedents have proved that after declaring both groups of Ahmadis as non-Muslims, according to the Constitution and law, they have the right to practice their religion and express and preach it, provided that they will neither use religious terms for Muslims in public nor present themselves as Muslims in public. “However, they have the right to ‘privacy of home’ in their houses, places of worship, and specific private institutions within ‘reasonable limits’ prescribed by law.” Mufti Usmani, while explaining his stance, maintained that the term \"tableegh\" (to preach) was used in paragraph 42, which meant that \"unconditional permission was granted\" to Sani. When summoned to the rostrum, Fazl also supported Mufti Usmani's requests and called for revision of the entire Supreme Court verdict. \"If you think Mubarak Sani deserves to be bailed then it is a different matter but all charges must be retained against his blasphemous actions,\" Fazl said while addressing the top judge. He said Sani's trial should continue as per the the Council of Islamic Ideology's (CII) recommendation. The court, after hearing opinion of various religious scholars who attended the proceedings, announced the decision to omit certain paras in admission to the recommendations of the CII and scholars' opinion, and stated that the expunged paras \"will not be cited as precedent \" in any future verdict. It also directed the trial court to review the sections imposed against Sani in the light of law. Talking to the media after the hearing, Fazl welcomed the SC's verdict and lauded CJP Isa for his \"positive attitude\" while hearing the matter. He said that the apex court deleted all the controversial clauses from its previous verdict. Fazl congratulated the religious groups on the favourable verdict and announced observing Friday (August 23) as 'thanksgiving day' to celebrate the verdict top court's judgment. "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a bid to boost the national economy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that he would soon roll out a five-year homegrown economic programme. Addressing the launching ceremony of the Buna-Raast connectivity project during a ceremony in Islamabad, the premier said the ‘Home-Grown Economic Programme’ would envisage measures to revive the country's economy by beefing up information technology, agriculture and other untapped sectors. After discussions and mulling with the stakeholders for months, he said, a wide range of parameters for the programme had been finalised. \"Great work has gone into it. By next week or so, we will finalise it. I will go to the people to announce the programme for the next five years,\" he remarked. Highlighting the challenges of reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and power sector, Shehbaz said he was personally monitoring the FBR’s digitisation and that the government was hopeful of positive outcomes of power sector reforms. \"There is no magic wand. It is all about hard work, sacrifice, blood and sweat. Insha Allah, you will see we will have dividends and will find our place in the comity of nations through hard work, hard work and hard work,\" he said. Under the Buna-Raast connectivity project, the Raast payment mechanism is being linked with the Arab Monetary Fund’s (AMF) Buna system to facilitate millions of overseas Pakistanis in Arab countries to send remittances through a swift, affordable and effective mechanism. The prime minister said that besides easing the remittance-sending process digitally, it would also help boost the country’s foreign exchange and further strengthen the already cordial relations between Pakistan and the Arab world. Calling it a great step forward in promoting financial transactions through modern techniques, he said the project would expand the reach of Pakistan’s digital payment infrastructure. \"This signifies how 21st-century Pakistan is moving ahead by augmenting modern technologies in the people's lives. This is the first cross-border real-time payment system linkage that will make remittances more affordable and accessible.\" Moreover, PM Shehbaz said that the project also held the potential to accelerate the connectivity into a future model of a wider payment system where transactions would take place from region to region with a potential of over $20 billion in annual payments. He thanked the AFM, State Bank of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Karandaaz for their support in launching the project. Earlier, he also gave away the mementoes to AMF Chairperson Dr Fahad Alturki, SBP Governor Jamil Ahmed, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation President Dr Anita Zaidi, and Karandaaz CEO Waqasul Hassan. In his remarks, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that macroeconomic stability is taking root in Pakistan’s economy as manifested by reduced current account deficit, stable currency, improved foreign reserves, upgraded sovereign ratings, and reviving investors' confidence. He said the government is committed to infrastructural reforms and that its efforts were bearing fruits, though a lot more was yet to be done. \"The remittances were on the surge with $3 billion received in July.\" About the Buna-Raast connectivity project, he said the digitalisation would help bring transparency and reduce leakages in remittances, taxation and the power sectors. He said the project would put the country on a sustainable path and on the right side of the FATF. Zaidi said the project would link the economies of Pakistan and the Arab world digitally, boost productivity and bring efficiency to systems. Besides, it will also improve individuals' lives making it cheaper to send money and improve families’ economic condition as 90% of remittance receivers were women. She viewed that the project would facilitate, particularly women entrepreneurs enabling them to sell their goods and receive money digitally."

  "description": "The Punjab police said on Friday that the main culprit behind a rocket attack from dacoits in Rahim Yar Khan District’s Machka area that martyred 12 cops has been killed. Organised criminal gangs have been active in the riverine border areas of southern Sindh and central Punjab for decades, often making money through kidnap-for-ransom assaults. Two police vehicles carrying around 22 policemen were on their way back from a police camp in the Katcha (riverine) area, where recent rains had rendered the road extremely muddy, causing one of the vehicles to break down. This is when the police party are said to have come under attack from dacoits, who fired rockets at the vehicles and then opened fire, martyring 11 policemen and injuring nine others. The death toll from the incident rose to 12 today. Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar told Dawn that both Punjab and Sindh police had launched a historic operation in the riverine area, with 320 police personnel from Punjab on the ground, in addition to the force from Sindh police. Today, the Punjab police said that in retaliation to yesterday’s attack, the main suspect had been killed while five of his accomplices had been injured. “Punjab police retaliated in response to the attack by terrorists in the kutcha areas. The main suspect who attacked policemen yesterday, Bashir Shar, has reached his logical end,” the police announced today in a post on X. “During the Punjab police’s action, five accomplices of dacoit Bashir Shar — dacoits Sanaullah Shar, Gada Ali, Kamlu Shar, Ramzan Shar, and Gadi — were also injured,” the police added.      Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had directed IG Anwar and other senior officials to head to Rahim Yar Khan to deal with the situation. Her Sindh counterpart Murad Ali Shah has also instructed his provincial police chief to establish contact with the Punjab Police, asking him to extend to them any assistance required.     CM Maryam had also directed the Punjab home secretary to initiate an immediate operation in the Katcha areas, according to a post on X by her PML-N party. “She has directed that a swift and effective response be given to the dacoits, with the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Punjab leading the operation,” the PML-N said.         Meanwhile, the number of policemen martyred in the attack has risen to 12. “At least twelve policemen were martyred, and eight others injured in the attack,” police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains told AFP. Wains said the gang then used rocket launchers to target the stranded policemen. The military had launched a full-scale operation against criminal gangs in Sindh in the early 1990s but they resurfaced after successive governments failed to maintain law and order in the province. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered “immediate and effective action” against the attackers, his office said in a statement on Thursday. The funeral prayers of the martyred policemen were offered in Rahim Yar Khan in the afternoon. The prayers were attended by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi as well as civil and military leaders, PTV News reported. Tributes were paid to the martyred cops and funeral wreaths were offered before the bodies were departed for the policemen’s hometowns. Fool-proof security ordered in Sindh Separately, in view of the Rahim Yar Khan attack, Sindh Interior Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed the police to remain extremely alert and ensure fool-proof security across the province. “Security measures should be made extremely concrete and extraordinary at every level, on the occasion of Friday,” Lanjar said in a statement. He ordered that police deployment at major mosques, imambargahs and Friday prayers be kept prominent. The minister also ordered that police patrolling, snap-checking and other security measures be put in place near gatherings for Friday prayers.  Additional reporting by Imtiaz Ali, Imran Gabol "

  "description": "  Telecom operators fear country may lose Rs12 billion annually if urgent measures not taken   PTA says two out of seven submarine cables faulty; IT minister, PTA chief skips Senate meeting   ISLAMABAD: As the Telecom Operators Association sought the intervention of the prime minister to fix disruptions in the internet which may cost the national economy billions of rupees, the IT minister and the chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) skipped the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology over the internet issue. Over the past few weeks, internet users across Pakistan have reported significant drops in speed and disruptions to social media platforms, like Facebook and WhatsApp. The business community and internet service providers (ISPs) have accused the government of intentionally slowing down digital services due to the installation of a “firewall”, but the government has blamed these problems on VPNs. It later attributed the slowdown to a fault in submarine cables. Doug Madory, an internet expert, did endorse the claim regarding the fault in the submarine cables, saying the reduced internet capacity for Pakistan was due to a fault in submarine cables. “We can see that PTCL (AS17557) lost transit from TMnet (AS4788), NTT (AS2914) and Lumen (AS3356) as a result of the SMW-4 failure on June 17th. It recently regained Lumen, but these losses would indeed result in reduced capacity for #Pakistan,” Mr Madory tweeted on Wednesday evening. Though the damaged cables may affect the internet speed and it has not happened for the first time, the intermittent outage of social media applications for longer periods is unprecedented. PM asked for help In reference to these disruptions, the telecom operators sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through a letter on Thursday, saying the sluggish internet could cost Pakistan almost Rs12 billion annually. According to the association, the nationwide slowdown will cause significant and long-lasting economic repercussions if not identified and rectified immediately.      They also expressed their willingness to participate in a dialogue and assist the relevant quarters in finding solutions to improve the current internet slowdown situation. The letter to the premier stated that due to the reduction in internet traffic, the country would suffer losses to the tune of Rs12 billion annually, adding that daily internet traffic in the country had reduced by approximately 6,400 terabytes. “This will significantly increase financial stress on the telecom sector. Incidentally, the corresponding loss to exchequer due to reduced revenue of the telecom sector will be in excess of Rs3 billion annually,” it stated. The letter pointed out that the disruptions in internet speed would have an adverse impact on foreign direct investments, the blue-collar workforce, the information technology industry, freelancers as well as the GDP. ‘Fault in submarine cables’ In a press release, the PTA announced that the internet slowdown and degradation of services was “due to [a] fault in two of the seven international submarine cables connecting Pakistan internationally”. According to the authority, “The AAE-1 cable has experienced a 250G outage due to rerouting between Iran and Qatar; similarly, SMW-4 cable (1.5T) has been out of service due to faults near Karachi.” The PTA claimed that the operators were re-routing traffic to other available cables to minimise the impact on internet users in Pakistan, adding that the relevant teams were fixing the fault. VPNs blamed again During a meeting of the Senate panel on IT, the government once again attributed the slowdown to faulty submarine cables and the increasing use of VPNs. The explanations came during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication as lawmakers criticised internet disruptions and sought explanation from relevant quarters. Headed by Chairperson Senator Palwasha Khan, the panel highlighted several issues, including the absence of the IT minister as well as the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) head. The meeting postponed the agenda related to the long-distance and international (LDI) operators due to the non-participation of relevant authorities. The next meeting will address these issues.      The committee also questioned the ban on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), which was reportedly implemented on the Ministry of Interior’s directive. The session began with a briefing on the operations and performance of the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) and the Electronic Certification Accreditation Council. It was noted that the PSEB, established as a Private Software Export Board in 1995, operated under a seven-member board of directors. Presently, there are 26,000 IT companies registered with the SECP. Despite the global IT market’s value of $5 trillion, Pakistan’s share was less than 0.04pc whereas the IT products accounted for 24pc of IT growth this year, matching last year’s growth rate. The committee was informed that 54pc of Pakistan’s IT exports were to the US, 21pc to Europe, 10pc to Gulf countries, and 14pc to the Asia Pacific region. There were currently 2,124 web design services companies, 452 network security firms, and 616 data storage and management companies. Additionally, Pakistan had 3,463 IT consulting firms, 870 social media consulting companies, 465 email marketing firms, 664 IT help desk companies, 940 cloud service providers, and 81 repair service companies. Similarly, the committee also took exception to the recruitment of the IT ministry’s secretary on a contractual basis rather than their appointment from the federal service pool.

  "description": "   PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif meets PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari at the PM House, on Thursday. —Courtesy PM Office  ISLAMABAD: The top leadership of the ruling PML-N and its key ally PPP met on Thursday in an effort to sort out differences between them on certain issues related to governance and recent policy decisions taken by the federal and Punjab governments. During the meeting held at the Prime Minister House and followed by a dinner, the PPP complained about the lack of implementation of the agreement reached between the two parties at the time of the formation of the government in February. Sources in the two parties told Dawn that members of the PPP delegation headed by party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari apprised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet members about their grievances, mostly related to the Punjab government. They agreed that the coordination committees of the two parties would meet at Governor House in Lahore on Sunday to “devise a mechanism to ensure regular coordination between the PPP and the Punjab government”.  Bilawal, PM Shehbaz hold talks, attend dinner; both sides agree to improve coordination  According to a handout issued by the PM Office, leaders of the two par­­­­ties reviewed the current political situation in the country. It quoted the PM as having stated that he had been working for the development and prosperity of the country in co­­ordination with the coalition parties. Besides Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the PPP delegation comprised ex-PM Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman and MNA Naveed Qamar. The prime minister was assisted by his deputy and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar. The PM had called the meeting after the issues of soaring electricity tariffs and rightsizing of ministries as part of austerity measures triggered a war of words between the ruling allies. The friction escalated on Friday when PML-N President Nawaz Sha­rif, alongside his daughter Maryam Nawaz, announced a Rs14 per unit relief for those consumers in Punjab who use between 200 and 500 units per month. This announcement was met with disdain from the PPP-led Sindh government and the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had accused the PML-N of introducing costly power plants decades ago, which, he argued, had led to the high electricity costs. He had also accused the federal government of neglecting Sindh, claiming that many projects requiring federal funds remained stalled. Besides, PPP had expressed serious reservations over the centre’s policy on rightsizing of ministries. The sources said that during Thursday’s meeting, the PM told the PPP members that the Centre had not provided a single penny to the Punjab province for this relief and that the provincial government had arranged resources from its own budget. The sources said that the two parties agreed to continue to cooperate with each other inside and outside the parliament. They claimed that during the meeting the PML-N showed its displeasure over the Sindh chief minister’s remarks about the party and termed them “inappropriate.” When contacted, Ahsan Iqbal said the meeting took place in a “cordial atmosphere” and both sides were of the view that they would have to work together. He confirmed that PPP had raised the issue of non-implementation of certain points of the agreement signed at the time of the formation of the government, but added that most of them were related to the Punjab government. He said the PM had asked Rana Sanaullah to devise a mechanism for better coordination and working relationship between the PPP and the Punjab government. In response to a question about the PPP’s grievances over the Punjab-only relief to power consumers, Mr Iqbal said the PM had told the PPP members that he would soon announce reforms in the power sector and that PPP would be taken into confidence before making such an announcement. The two sides also discussed the upcoming legislative agenda as the government planned to convene the National Assembly session from Aug 26. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024 "

  "description": "• Gandapur says power show to be held on Sept 8 • Aleema claims Imran ‘kept in dark’ about postponement • Party workers voice dissatisfaction over the decision • Sher Afzal Marwat ‘released after brief detention’ ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR: A decision by the PTI to postpone its Aug 22 gathering in Tarnol at the eleventh hour stirred controversy within the party, as some leaders claimed that party founder Imran Khan, who is incarcerated in Adiala jail, was not consulted before the postponement. Although PTI leader Gohar Ali Khan and Azam Swati claimed on Thursday that the decision to postpone the gathering had been taken by the founder, many in the party — including Mr Khan’s sister — did not buy this. At a press talk outside Adiala jail, the two leaders said that they had arrived there to meet Mr Khan first thing in the morning. They claimed the PTI founder told them that the rally scheduled for Thursday should be postponed, in deference to demonstrations to ensure the sanctity of Khatm-i-Nabuwwat (PBUH), which were also sla­ted to be held on the same day. Similarly, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur also clai­med that the power show was cancelled on PTI fou­nder’s order, adding the gathering would now be held on Sept 8. However, a senior PTI leader told Dawn that the decision to postpone the Tarnol gathering was taken during a meeting of the party leadership in Pesha­war on Wednesday night, which was held after the cancellation of a no-objection certificate for the rally by the federal government. “The party leadership met KP chief minister at the CM House on Wednesday night. They decided not to hold the gathering in absence of official permission,” insiders claimed. KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif confirmed that a meeting was held to take stock of the situation following the cancellation of the permission. However, the abrupt decision raised many an eyebrow and showed there was a lack of coordination within the party as well as a trust deficit between various leaders. An audio recording, purportedly of Aleema Khan, added fuel to this impression. In the clip, broadcast by several TV channels on Thursday she can be heard saying the power show was postponed without taking Imran Khan into confidence. She said it was a decision of “some party leaders”, whom she accused of working for the establishment. In the clip, the voice that purportedly belongs to Aleema Khan can also be heard asking: “Who inst­ructed Azam Swati to meet Imran Khan early in the morning and who instru­c­ted him to postpone the meeting?” She questioned how the pair was able to meet her brother so early in the morning, before business hours commenced. Interestingly, Mahmood Khan Achkzai, who heads the PTI-led opposition alliance, had no idea about the postponement of the event, as he arrived at the venue with other leaders at 4pm, only to find that the PTI leadership was not present. After the rally was postponed, hundreds of PTI workers, who had left their respective areas for Islamabad, also began making their way back. A video making rounds on social media showed KP CM Gandapur, who addressed char­­ged PTI workers in Swabi, distributing money among party supporters. Meanwhile, party workers and leaders in Swabi voiced their discontent with the decision to postpone the rally, saying the delay indicated PTI’s “weakness” and failure to hold a gathering in Islam­abad. They also criticised the party leadership for repeatedly postponing the power show. Spme PTI supporters blocked the Peshawar-Islam­abad Motor­way for some time, after it emerged that party firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat had been deta­ined by police. However, he was subsequently released. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024 "

  "description": "• Govt okays export of sugar • Ends Dar’s policy that linked sugar exports to domestic price stability ISLAMABAD: The government appr­oved a Rs20 billion “special allocation” on Thursday for Operation Azm-i-Istehkam, an initiative announced three months ago to combat terrorism and extremism. The decision was made during a meeting of the cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), which also approved the export of 100,000 tonnes of sugar while exempting sugar mills from responsibility for domestic price hikes. The ECC meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, sanctioned supplementary grants totalling Rs2.23bn for security forces. Of this, Rs1.95bn was allocated to the Frontier Corps Balochistan (South) for security expenses related to the Reko Diq project, and Rs276.25 million to the Frontier Corps Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North) for project implementation letters (PILs). Operation Azm-i-Istehkam was anno­unced on June 22 after a Central Apex Committee meeting of the National Action Plan. The operation aims to deploy the country’s full military, diplomatic, legislative and socio-economic resources to decisively defeat terrorism and extremism. The announcement was met with fierce criticism from opposition parties — including the PTI, JUI-F and the Awami National Party — both inside and outside the parliament, with the KP chief minister even denying that any such thing was discussed with him during the apex committee meeting. The intense opposition then prompted the government to clarify that the campaign, to be launched under the banner of Azm-i-Istehkam, would not be a kinetic large-scale military operation, nor would it entail the mass displacement of the local populace. The country has witnessed an uptick in terrorism in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Azm-i-Istehkam is the latest in a series of counter-terrorism operations launched by the Pakistan Army since the mid-2000s. More recent operations include Zarb-i-Azb, launched in 2014 by Gen Raheel Sharif to combat militants in North Waziristan, and Raddul Fasaad, initiated in 2017 under Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, to eliminate what was then described as “residual terrorist threats” in the country. Sugar export The ECC, at the request of Minister for Industries and Production Rana Tanveer Hussain, approved a major concession to sugar mills and their association — Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) — by exonerating them from potential increases in sugar prices in the local market that normally move up on lower domestic stocks. The provision was introduced about a decade ago by the ECC — then led by Ishaq Dar, who linked export permissions to price stability in the local market. All subsequent ECCs maintained this condition, and export permissions were suspended in case of domestic price hikes. Sugar mills had long lobbied against this condition, arguing that market forces were beyond their control. They eventually persuaded the minister for industries during a Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) meeting on Wednesday that mills should only be held accountable for ex-mill prices, not market prices. “The ECC approved the summary of the Ministry of Industries and Production” regarding the export of a further 100,000 tonnes of sugar, an official announcement said, adding the benchmark for retail price of sugar would be “delinked from the permission to export sugar as retail price is not directly under the control of sugar mills”. The ECC relaxed an earlier condition that required the revocation of export quotas if sugar mills failed to pay growers from export proceeds. This condition will now apply only to non-compliant mills rather than the PSMA as a whole. In yet another gift to sugar mills, the ECC extended the period allowed for exporting sugar from 45 to 60 days from the date of quota allocation by the cane commissioner. The ECC also decided that export proceeds for sugar destined for Afghanistan must be received in advance through banking channels. For other destinations, export proceeds via letters of credit (LCs) are allowed within 60 days of the LC’s opening. The committee decided to monitor the market situation monthly and review. This decision followed a SAB meeting chaired by Rana Tanveer on Wednesday, which recommended exporting 100,000 tonnes of surplus sugar with the understanding that sugar mills would “ensure maintenance of ex-mill sugar prices”.

  "description": "   (From left to right) Policemen sit idle at Faizabad Interchange. The other picture shows Pak Secretariat metro bus station closed due to a religious group’s protest in Islamabad on Thursday. — Photos by Mohammad Asim & Online  ISLAMABAD: Thursday was yet another hectic day for the Islamabad Police as its officials and personnel remained engaged with the protesters from the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and a religious group besides guarding about three dozen sensitive and main points in the capital. Officers said at least eight police officials, including the station house officer of Tarnol, were injured during a confrontation with the PTI supporters who had gathered at Tarnol for the public meeting which was later postponed by the party on the directive of party founder Imran Khan from Adiala Jail. On Wednesday, the capital administration had cancelled the NOC issued to the PTI for holding a public gathering at Tarnol, as Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz-i-Nabuwat had also planned to reach the Supreme Court in connection with the hearing of appeals against the judgement in the Mubarak Sani case. The police used over 400 containers to seal the entry points of the capital at Faizabad, Tarnol, Rawat and Bhara Kahu. Moreover, entry points to the Red Zone housing sensitive installations such as the Supreme Court and Diplomatic Enclave were also sealed.  Despite sealing of entry points, nearly 1,000 activists of religious group reach Express Chowk; PTI issued fresh NOC for Sept 8  However, about 800 to 1,000 people belonging to religious parties managed to reach Express Chowk in connection with the hearing in the apex court, the police officers said.      They said workers, activists and leaders of the PTI in small groups also reached Tarnol Chowk, where the party’s public gathering was to be held. A rally comprising PTI leaders, workers and supporters appeared at the Tarnol Chowk from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa side and started chanting slogans. As a result, a physical confrontation started between them and the police. The PTI supporters pelted the police with stones injuring eight policemen, three of them critically, said the police officers. In response, the police resorted to baton charge and fired teargas shells to disperse them, they said, alleging that the PTI supporters opened fire while dispersing from the spot. The police rounded up some of them but the others escaped. However, they were chased and intercepted at the nearby pickets. The police arrested at least three dozen people, including an MNA and an MPA. The injured police officials were taken to a hospital where the condition of three of them was stated to be critical. Meanwhile, nearly 800 to 1,000 people, including religious leaders, reached Express Chowk, near the Red Zone, despite the sealing of the entry points of the capital. They remained at the Express Chowk till the evening. The police officers said workers and activists of religious parties chanted slogans and as a result more police contingents were called to the area. Paramilitary troops were also deployed inside the Red Zone, including at D-Chowk. The capital administration, however, issued a new NOC to the PTI for holding a public gathering on September 8. The NOC issued from the office of the district magistrate said, “In continuation of the chief commissioner’s order dated 21st August, 2024 wherein, the NOC for holding public gathering on 22nd August 2024 at Tarnol, Islamabad was suspended keeping in view various reasons including the law and order situation due to gathering by religious parties on the same day, you are hereby given NOC to hold Jalsa/Public Gathering on 8th September, 2024 at Islamabad/surroundings (with proper security cover by the Administration) on the following terms and conditions.” In case of violation of any of the above terms and conditions, the organisers shall be liable to face legal proceedings and the NOC shall automatically stand cancelled, it stated.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Another child has been paralysed by poliovirus in Sindh, taking the tally for the current year so far to 16. Poliovirus traces have been reported in 62 districts so far this year, a significant increase from 28 districts last year. According to an official of Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, the Type-1 Wild Poliovirus (WPV1) has been confirmed in a 29-month-old female child from Hyderabad district. “This is the first polio case from Hyderabad, the third from Sindh, and the 16th case in Pakistan this year. As many as 12 cases have been reported from Balochistan, three from Sindh, and one from Punjab,” he said. In reply to a question, the official said the genetic cluster was YB3A4B and the case was 99.22 per cent linked to a virus detected in an environmental sample from the same district (Hyderabad) on May 8 this year. Meanwhile, sewage samples from three new districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh and eight previously positive districts have tested positive for WPV1. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication has confirmed that environmental samples from Karak, Sujawal, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Zhob, Quetta, Loralai, Chaman, Pishin, Rawalpindi and Islamabad districts contained WPV1. “Poliovirus has now been detected in 62 districts of the country and affected 16 children so far this year, indicating the persistent risk of polio infection to children in these communities and across the country,” the official said.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: A day after a revised list of political parties issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan showed Asfandyar Wali Khan as the Awami National Party president, the ECP on Thursday notified certificate of ANP’s intra-party elections conducted after a year’s delay. Though the ‘updated’ list of political parties remains unchanged, the notification recognises Aimal Wali Khan as president of the party around three and a half months after the exercise. The belated issuance of intra-party elections is yet another violation of the law on part of the ECP. Under Section 209 (1) of the Elections Act, a political party is required to submit to the ECP within seven days from completion of the intra-party elections, a certificate signed by an office-bearer authorised by the party head, to the commission to the effect that the elections were held in accordance with the constitution of the political party and this act to elect the office-bearers at the federal, provincial and local levels, wherever applicable. The sub-section 3 of Section 209 reads: “The Commission shall, within seven days from the receipt of the certificate of a political party under sub-section (1), publish the certificate on its website.”  ‘Updated’ list of parties on commission’s website still shows Asfandyar as party head  On Jan 13, the ECP had allowed the ANP to contest polls on its election symbol of “Lantern” despite its failure to fulfil the legal requirement of holding intra-party polls. The development came a day after ECP delisted 13 political parties over their failure to meet the legal requirement. While announcing its reserved verdict, the ECP imposed a fine of Rs20,000 on the ANP with the direction to hold intra-party polls till May 10, some three months even after the Feb 8 general elections. The order surprised many as under which law the ECP could allow one party, and not the other, to participate in general elections on its election symbol without holding intra-party election. Why the concession was not available to the PTI, they question. The ECP had earlier noted that the ANP’s last intra-party polls were conducted in May 2019, and since the term of office-bearers was four years according to its constitution, the same had already expired over eight months back. The verdict, which was reserved on Dec 21, 2023, on the intra-party polls of ANP, was announced on the last date for allocation of symbols to the contesting candidates by the returning officers. Sections 208, 209 and 210 of the Elections Act, 2017, had been invo-ked to delist over a dozen political parties for the failure to meet the legal requirement to be eligible to get poll symbols. A five-member bench of the ECP, headed by Chief Election Commis­sioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, had earlier turned down the ANP’s plea for a six-month time for conduct of intra-party elections, leaving a hint that ANP might not be able to contest the upcoming general election with its poll symbol. Even the list of election symbols sent to the returning officers also did not include the symbol of “Lantern”. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: A simultaneous vaccination campaign will be launched on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border next month as officials blame cross-border movement for the dozen cases of the virus reported from Balochistan this year. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries where polio is still endemic. Since January 2024, the former has reported 16 cases of poliovirus, 12 of them from Balochistan, which borders five Afghan provinces. In a press conference on Thursday, Inamul Haq Qureshi, the Emergency Operation Centre’s Baloch­istan coordinator, said a five-day special countrywide vaccination campaign will be launched on Sept 9. It will cover 36 districts of Balochistan, while a simultaneous campaign will be launched in Afghanistan on the same day.  Authorities attribute surge in Balochistan to cross-border movement  He said the Pakistan authorities were in touch with their Afghan counterparts in Kanda­har for coordination over the virus situation. Mr Qureshi said 12 children were diagnosed with poliovirus in Balochistan this year, three of whom have died, indicating that the virus is “life-threatening”. He said the rising number of cases in Balochistan can be attributed to three factors: population movement leading to the spread of the virus, refusal by some parents to vaccinate their children, and nutritional deficiencies and weakened immunity in children. Mr Qureshi alleged that vaccinators were forging the immunisation data to show more vaccinated children without inoculating them. He said in Quetta division, 534 out of over 4,000 suspected workers were reportedly involved in this forgery and an investigation was initiated against them. After the processing, 74 polio workers were found involved in the fake vaccination scandal, and they were terminated from service. He added that Balochistan was ready to be declared a polio-free province as no case was reported for 28 months from any area before a case surfaced in February. Sewage water samples from last year show the presence of polio virus in 17 Balochistan districts, he said, calling the current virus situation “alarming”, especially the death of three children due to the virus in the past four months. He said the children, including a baby girl and two boys, belonged to Qila Saifullah, Quetta and Kharan. The children had suffered from other diseases since they lost immunity after the poliovirus crippled them, the official added. He pointed out that incomplete vaccination coverage and border area mobility were obstacles to eradicating polio. To address these challenges, a strategy has been developed, and the media and parents are being urged to cooperate to protect children from this disease. He mentioned that the case reported in Qila Abdullah involved a child who had migrated from Karachi and contracted the virus. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024 "

The protesters marched on the Airport Road and gathered at the Markhor Chowk where the Buitems Staff Association president, Sohail Anwar, and others addressed the rally and criticised the university administration for not paying their salaries. The speakers said the “callous and cruel” administration of the university was behind all the issues from house requisition to medical policy, from non-payment of bonuses to salaries and from suspension of the study leave to the halting of promotions. They said the university registrar was “the most corrupt person” who is being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Bureau of Balochistan. They demanded the registrar’s immediate removal until the investigation is completed against him. The Buitems Staff Association president said that 15 members of the body have been issued show-cause notices for demanding their basic rights.

  "description": "TAXILA: Two girls were killed and five inj­ured after gunmen opened fire at a school van in the Dheri Kot area of Attock on Thu­rsday, according to eyewitnesses and police sources. The pickup van was carrying students of a school run by a charity from Dheri Kot village to Surg in the foothills of Kalla Chitta range when two persons riding a motorcycle intercepted the vehicle and opened fire. The assailants’ target was the van driver, Attock District Police Officer (DPO) Sardar Ghayas told reporters, adding that the motive behind the attack was an old enmity. According to eyewitnesses, as attackers opened fire, the driver accelerated, and the bullets hit the children sitting in the rear of the vehicle. The deceased children have been identified as Rameen Shafiq, 9 and Arwa Jamshaid, 10. According to district emergency officer Ali Has­nian, five children aged between four and 12 and the driver were injured in the attack. They have been shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for treatment. The injured were identified as Muhaib Ali, 8; Sumeria Bibi, 7; Shahzif Shafiq, 8; Haseeb Ali, 12; Shahzim Shabbir, 4; and Muhammad Afzal, 48. DPO Gul, while talking to reporters outside the DHQ Hospital, ruled out terrorism as the motive behind the attack. He added that initial investigation suggested the gunmen, identified as Nasir and Nasim, targeted the van due to a personal enmity with the driver. A case has been registered against the suspects and police are conducting raids to arrest them, he added. A police spokesman also said human and digital intelligence is being used to trace the culprits. While quoting the Atto­­ck police spokesman, Wa­­se­em Babar, AFP reported that the gunmen were em­­broiled in court cases with the family of the driver. Attock Deputy Commis­sioner Rao Atif Raza assu­red the victims’ families of justice and hoped the culprits would be arrested soon. Sheikh Aftab Ahmad, PML-N’s National Assem­bly member from Attock, also visited the injured students in the hospital. “Firing on children in a school van is an act of brutality,” he said, adding that the attackers “deserve no leniency”. Shock and sorrow Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended upon the Dheerikot area when the victims’ bodies were brought to their homes. Mourners consol­ed Muhammad Shafiq, whose daughter lost her life and the son was injured. The victims’ last rites were performed at a local graveyard. Condemnations The president, prime minister and other political leaders have condemned the attack. In his message, Presid­ent Asif Ali Zardari said strict action must be taken against the attackers. “Targeting innocent chi­­l­­dren is a cruel and sha­­­­meful act,” he was quo­ted as saying in a statement from the President’s House. He prayed for the dec­e­ased, as well as for the speedy recovery of the injured children. Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif also called the attack a “cruel and gruesome” act. According to Radio Pak­istan, the prime minister expres­sed so­­lidarity with the berea­ved families and prayed for the departed souls. Interior Minister Moh­sin Naqvi, National Asse­m­bly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Pun­jab Governor Sardar Sale­­em Haider and PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zard­ari also condemned the attack. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz sought a report on the provincial police chief, according to a statement issued by her public relations officer. She expressed deep grief over the death of the two students and directed the authorities to provide the best treatment facilities to the injured. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024 "

  "content": "Bangladesh opener Shadman Islam hit a fighting half-century on Friday to lead his team to 134-2 at lunch on the third day of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. The 29-year-old left-hander was unbeaten 53 with senior batter Mominul Haque 45 not out as the duo defied Pakistan's pace attack on a Rawalpindi stadium pitch that has slowed down considerably. The visitors still trail Pakistan's first innings total of 448-6 by 314 runs with eight wickets intact. Shadman pulled pacer Naseem Shah's last delivery before the interval for his sixth boundary to reach a third Test half-century, extending the unbroken third wicket stand with Haque to 81. The stand led the recovery after Pakistan removed Zakir Hasan (12) and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (16) in the extended three-hour session due to Friday prayers. Haque has also batted with confidence, having hit four boundaries. Pakistan employed all four pacers but are missing the services of a frontline spinner. Part-time slow bowler Agha Salman has made little impact in his eight overs so far. Resuming at 27-0, Bangladesh lost Zakir to a smart catch by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, diving to his left to take a one-handed catch in Naseem Shah's fifth over of the day. Shanto looked good during his short knock but was bowled between bat and pad by Khurram Shahzad, leaving the visitors on 53-2. Pakistan: Abdullah Shafique, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood (c), Babar Azam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Salman Ali Agha, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Ali, Khurram Shahzad Bangladesh: Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Shadman Islam, Zakir Hasan, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Kumer Das, Mehidy Hassan Miraz, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Nahid Rana"

  "content": "KARACHI: A new CCTV footage of the Karsaz accident has emerged on Friday  just days after a father and daughter were crushed by a speeding SUV. Obtained by Geo News, the CCTV footage shows the luxury vehicle racing through a service lane before it brutally crashed into a motorcycle, killing a 26-year-old Aamna Arif and her 60-year-old father, Imran Arif. In the new footage, the SUV — driven by a woman identified in the first information report (FIR) as \"Natasha\", who was sent to jail on judicial remand by a court in Karachi on Wednesday — is initially seen in the service lane and slowing down as another car advances in its direction from the opposite side. To make way for the approaching car, the SUV takes a slight turn on its left soon before hitting a motorcycle on its right, after which the bikes fall off on the street side. As seen in the latest video, the SUV then allegedly proceeds to the street where it hit the father-daughter duo, which has been recorded in other CCTV footages of the accident.  It should be noted that the woman — who ran over Amna, Imran and injured five others on Monday at the Karsaz Road — is currently in judicial custody following orders by a Karachi East court a day after it ordered its production in the court and sought a medical report regarding the suspect. The investigation officer (IO) of the case requested a seven-day physical remand of the accused, stating that the Section-322 is non-bailable offence. The court, on Tuesday, had given a one-day physical remand of the suspect who is a resident of Karachi's KDA Scheme-I area. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on Monday. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The detained woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. Her husband also reached the police station after receiving information of the incident. According to the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the luxury vehicle's driver hit his brother’s bike from rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving licence, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. Whereas, they said, charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR. Meanwhile, police have asked the family for the medical history of the suspect involved in the accident. Blood and urine samples had been taken for medico-legal examination of the suspect, said police surgeon. According to the woman's husband, she took medication for mental stress. Police said the accident was being investigated from various aspects and they were also trying to obtain CCTV footage of the incident. Rescue sources said the father and daughter’s bodies were kept in Edhi mortuary and their funeral prayer would be offered after Asr prayers."

  "content": "KARACHI: As the port city grapples with humid weather, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its forecast on Friday, said partly cloudy skies are expected to persist for the next 24 hours. Additionally, the PMD today recorded a minimum temperature of 28.5°C in the metropolis, with maximum temperature in the city likely to fluctuate between 33°C to 35°C. Currently, westward winds in the city are blowing at a speed of 18 kilometres per hour with 78% humidity in the air. Meanwhile, some parts of Karachi may experience drizzle in the morning and at night. According to Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz, a new system is likely to affect Sindh, potentially bringing heavy rainfall to Karachi on August 27 and 28. This system will persist in the region until August 30. He also alerted residents of the provincial capital to brace for potential urban flooding as a result of the heavy rainfall. Additionally, meteorological analysts have said that a low pressure area which causes rain has formed near West Bengal, and this system \"may cause rain in eastern Sindh, including Karachi, in the coming days.\" Furthermore, meteorological analysts expect this system to enter eastern Sindh on August 26. According to Indian meteorologist Mahesh Palawat, a rain-causing low pressure area is passing through central India and is likely to intensify. Palawat said that this system brings a possibility of heavy rain spells in southern Sindh from August 26 to 30. \"Punjab may experience rainfall from August 27,\" the Indian meteorologist said, adding that various parts of Pakistan may be hit with rainfall between August 29 and 30. PMD meteorologist Anjum Nazir said this could be the strongest system to affect southern Sindh so far. Meanwhile, Palawat also expects Sindh and Balochistan to experience moderate rain."

  "content": "KARACHI: The fear of monkeypox has prompted massive screening of people arriving from abroad as passengers of 135 international flights were screened at airports in Pakistan on Thursday alone, Geo News reported quoting sources as saying. The sources said at least 18,479 such passengers were screened countrywide within 24 hours.  According to the sources, 4,595 passengers were screened at the Jinnah International Airport Karachi, 4,964 passengers were screened at the Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore, and 4,790 passengers were screened at the Islamabad International Airport. They said screening of 1,871 passengers from 14 flights was conducted at the Multan airport, 802 passengers who arrived on seven international flights were screened at the Sialkot airport, 991 at the Peshawar airport, 320 at Faisalabad airport and 146 at Quetta airport. The Federal Ministry of Health on August 20 issued strict guidelines provisioning screening, isolation and other preventive measures at all international airports across the country in light of the threat posed by the recent global outbreak of the monkeypox virus. \"To mitigate the risk of international spread, it is essential for all international airports in Pakistan to implement strict preventive measures,\" read the notification.  Apart from provisioning screenings for passengers and crew members upon arrival, the government has also linked the issuance of visa on arrival to health clearance of the passengers. The development comes as the country has reported at least one mpox case after a new variant was confirmed on August 15 in Sweden and was linked to a growing outbreak in Africa — the first sign of its spread outside the continent. As per the WHO, mpox is a viral disease related to the now-eradicated smallpox virus and can spread through any close contact and through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles. Initial symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, muscle pain, swelling of the glands, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness which are often followed by a painful or itchy rash with raised lesions that scab over and resolve over a period of weeks. The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) also directed all airlines flying into Pakistan from abroad to adopt preventive measures such as providing face masks to passengers, ensuring sanitising of the hands of staff and passengers as well as disinfection of the luggage. As per the health ministry's guidelines, the PCAA would be responsible for facilitating the implementation of health measures without disrupting airport activities and will ensure compliance with the SOPs by carrying out regular inspections and audits. Meanwhile, the Border Health Services (BHS) — working as the lead agency responsible for the overall coordination and management of mpox-related operations at international airports — manages the isolation and safe transportation of suspected mpox cases to designated medical facilities. The BHS will also report confirmed cases to local and national health authorities and maintain surveillance data. The BHS has implemented thermal scanning at all entry points to detect passengers with fever, a common symptom of mpox, and their personnel will also conduct visual inspections and symptom checks to identify any passengers displaying signs of the disease. Passengers or crew members identified as potential mpox cases will be immediately isolated in a designated area within the airport. The authority will also enforce quarantine measures for passengers who have been in close contact with a confirmed mpox case, in accordance with national and international health guidelines. In the event of a confirmed mpox case, the authority will initiate contact tracing procedures for all individuals who were in proximity to the infected person during the flight or at the airport. Passengers identified through contact tracing will be monitored for symptoms and provided with instructions on how to report any health concerns."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Amid growing contentions between the two key ruling allies — the Pakistan Peoples Parties (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the top leaders of the two parties including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal-Bhutto Zaddari sat together in Islamabad on Thursday to iron out differences.    Sources told Geo News that the coalition government led by PM Shehbaz took the PPP leadership into confidence ahead of \"crucial legislation\" in the National Assembly.  In this regard, the sources said a session of the National Assembly will be convened on Monday for the \"crucial legislation\".  Without divulging details of the upcoming legislation, the insiders said the two sides also discussed the prevailing political situation in the country and various key issues. The PPP delegation led by party chairman Bilawal consisted of Senator Sherry Rehman, former National Assembly speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and MNA Naveed Qamar. From the PML-N side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and PM's aide on public and political affairs Rana Sanaullah attended the huddle.  Sources said that PPP shared various concerns with PM Shehbaz, including the non-implementation of written agreement regarding power-sharing formula in Punjab. \"PPP is constantly being ignored in the Punjab government,\" the sources cited one of the objections raised during the meeting. They said that a meeting of the PML-N and PPP's coordination committees has been called at Punjab Governor House on Sunday (August 25), where the issues between the two parties will be resolved. Speaking on Geo News show 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath' earlier today, PM’s aide Sanaullah confirmed the meeting between PM Shehbaz and Bilawal. “All issues were discussed with the PPP,” he said adding that the premier will meet the PPP chief again next week. Sanaullah further claimed that most of the issues with the PPP have been resolved. “There will be a meeting with the PPP next week to make progress on some issues,” the PML-N leader added. It may be noted that the two political allies have been at odds for quite sometime over the issue of federal budget, power subsidy among others.  The most recent was the exchange of harsh words between PPP and PML-N on the issue of latter's power relief in Punjab. The sources earlier said that Bilawal was likely convey the party’s concerns and reservations on the PML-N government’s economic policies to the prime minister.  As per the sources, the party's concerns included Centre's \"excuses\" based on \"strict conditions\" by International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the matter of providing subsidies and relief for the people, while Punjab provided relief to its masses at the same time. Moreover, provision of cheap electricity to the people of Sindh through using coal which is abundant in Thar was also one of the party's concerns. After the February 8 general elections, the PPP formed government in Sindh and announced its support for PML-N in formation of the government in Centre and Punjab but refused to accept the ministries."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has approved the federal government’s appeal to expunge controversial paras from the contentious Mubarak Sani case verdict. A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, on Thursday (today) heard the Centre's plea alongside the Punjab government’s petition seeking amendments to the top court verdict of February 6. The apex court had overturned the conviction of sacrilege accused Sani, who sought deletion of certain charges framed against him in the case filed under Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act. In its judgment, the court had noted that the offence that the defendant had been accused of was not criminalised till 2021. Consequently, the apex court set aside the conviction and ordered the immediate release of the petitioner. After the verdict, the provincial government filed a review petition on the SC verdict under Article 188 of the Constitution, but on July 24 the top court declared it did not deviate in any way from the decisions of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court, in approving the bail of the sacrilege accused. The verdict favouring Sani drew outrage among religious circles, and a debate in the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Law and Justice where both the treasury and opposition benches agreed that the federal government file a petition in the Supreme Court.  Besides the Punjab government's plea seeking omissions of certain portions from the court’s July 24 revised verdict, the Centre also filed a miscellaneous plea on August 17 as per Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directives. The Punjab government in its petition maintained that some leading clerics and members of parliament requested the federal government to approach the top court and highlight some portions of the verdict that they said merited correction.  It further maintained that certain conclusions and observations made in other parts of the judgment seem to be a mistake and inconsistent with previous rulings of the highest court. Jamiat Ulema-e-Isfam Fazl's Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani of Jamia Darul Uloom Karachi among the other religious scholars, who requested the federal government for approaching the apex court, attended today's hearing. In the short verdict, the top court said the paras excluded from the verdict cannot be cited as precedent in any judgment.    At the outset of the hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Usman Awan informed the court that parliament and certain religious leaders had urged the federal government to approach the top court on the matter again after the July 24 verdict.  While acknowledging that a \"second review\" of the original verdict was not possible, the AGP noted that the government had approached the court in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. During the hearing, CJ Isa remarked: \"If we make a mistake, it should be corrected.\" The top judge apologised to Mufti Usmani, who attended the hearing virtually via video link, for not being able to view all the documents provided to the court by those who were served notices. He then asked the cleric to identify the \"mistakes\" and \"objections\" in the verdict.  \"Our country is a Islamic state where references to Quran and Hadith are made in the judicial decisions. I am not immune to making any mistake\", CJP Isa stated. Approving the provincial government's plea, the apex court decided to take assistance from Usmani, Fazl and other religious scholars on the matter. Addressing the court, Mufti Usmani requested to expunge two paragraphs, no 7 and no 42, from the July 24 revised verdict and amend the part where the court accepted to omit the charges against the accused. Paragraph 42 stated: “Details of the Constitutional and legal provisions and judicial precedents have proved that after declaring both groups of Ahmadis as non-Muslims, according to the Constitution and law, they have the right to practice their religion and express and preach it, provided that they will neither use religious terms for Muslims in public nor present themselves as Muslims in public. “However, they have the right to ‘privacy of home’ in their houses, places of worship, and specific private institutions within ‘reasonable limits’ prescribed by law.” Mufti Usmani, while explaining his stance, maintained that the term \"tableegh\" (to preach) was used in paragraph 42, which meant that \"unconditional permission was granted\" to Sani. When summoned to the rostrum, Fazl also supported Mufti Usmani's requests and called for revision of the entire Supreme Court verdict. \"If you think Mubarak Sani deserves to be bailed then it is a different matter but all charges must be retained against his blasphemous actions,\" Fazl said while addressing the top judge. He said Sani's trial should continue as per the the Council of Islamic Ideology's (CII) recommendation. The court, after hearing opinion of various religious scholars who attended the proceedings, announced the decision to omit certain paras in admission to the recommendations of the CII and scholars' opinion, and stated that the expunged paras \"will not be cited as precedent \" in any future verdict. It also directed the trial court to review the sections imposed against Sani in the light of law. Talking to the media after the hearing, Fazl welcomed the SC's verdict and lauded CJP Isa for his \"positive attitude\" while hearing the matter. He said that the apex court deleted all the controversial clauses from its previous verdict. Fazl congratulated the religious groups on the favourable verdict and announced observing Friday (August 23) as 'thanksgiving day' to celebrate the verdict top court's judgment. "

  "description": "The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Saturday denied media reports about the potential closure of automated teller machines (ATM) and a telecommunication blackout in the country due to the non-renewal of long-distance international (LDI) licences. The LDI operators’ main function is to provide international incoming and outgoing telecom call services. Most of the 10 operators’ licences will expire in July-August 2024. The LDI operators are Worldcall, Redtone, ADG-LDI, Telecard, Dancom, Wise­comm, Circlenet, Wat­een, 4B-Gentel and Multinet. Most of them have not yet paid the principal overdue for the Universal Ser­vice Fund (USF) in their 20-year licence contract, which will soon expire. Their total outstanding principal amount reportedly stands at Rs24 billion, and the PTA has asked them to settle their dues in order to renew their licences for the next 20 years. The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunications has reconstituted a steering committee to address the issue. Media reports earlier today said the PTA expressed concern during a Friday meeting of the IT standing committee that the non-renewal of LDI licences could potentially “significantly impact” the country’s telecom sector. According to documents presented in the meeting, available with Dawn.com, the impact could potentially affect “service quality, business operations and the broader economy”. More specifically, the PTA warned that around “50 per cent mobile traffic will be affected and many towers will be out of service, around 10pc of internet traffic will be affected, banking service will be affected,  around 40pc [of] ATM banking machines will be out of service”, many corporate intranets will be out of service and international communication services and voice traffic will be disrupted as well. However, a statement issued by the authority today rejected what it termed as “fake news” circulating in the media about the potential closure of ATMs. “It is clarified that currently there is no such issue of non-availability/closure of LDI networks that may potentially impact IT or financial sector, including ATM networks. “Please note that operations of the expired LDI licencees are not suspended or shut down.” The development comes amid the Telecom Operators Association seeking the intervention of the prime minister to fix recent disruptions in the internet which may cost the national economy billions of rupees. Over the past few weeks, internet users across Pakistan have reported significant drops in speed and disruptions to social media platforms, like Facebook and WhatsApp. The business community and internet service providers have accused the government of intentionally slowing down digital services due to the installation of a “firewall”, but the government has blamed these problems on VPNs. It later attributed the slowdown to a fault in submarine cables. In reference to these disruptions, the telecom operators sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through a letter on Thursday, saying the sluggish internet could cost Pakistan almost Rs12 billion annually. According to the association, the nationwide slowdown will cause significant and long-lasting economic repercussions if not identified and rectified immediately. "

  "description": "Government spokesperson for legal affairs Barrister Aqeel Malik has hinted that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s cases concerning the violence on May 9 last year might go to the military courts. Countrywide protests erupted on May 9 last year after the paramilitary Rangers whisked away Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a corruption case. While the protests were underway, social media was flooded with footage of rioting and vandalism at various spots, including the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence and General Headquarters, the army’s head of office in Rawalpindi. The already incarcerated former prime minister was “arrested” in these cases on July 15 — just a day after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been apprehended in a new Toshakhana case, following their acquittal in the Iddat case. In an interview on DawnNewsTV programme Doosra Rukh on Friday, Barrister Malik was questioned whether he thought Imran could be trialled in a military court following the arrest of former intelligence chief Lt-Gen (retired) Faiz Hameed to which he said: “Yes absolutely.” He said the events and vandalism seen on May 9 invited the application of the Army Act since military installations were attacked and damaged. He alleged that the PTI founder orchestrated and “properly operated” the riots that took place last year. “This was premeditated. This was preplanned,” Malik said. He further said regarding military courts that “it is entirely possible that Imran Khan’s trial is held in a military court and the reason for that is because the Army Act will be applicable.” He said that a lot of people were saying that any conviction by a military could be appealed at the high court, but he added neither the high court nor the Supreme Court could entertain it. “According to the legal provisions, the appeal for the case would be taken by the military court of appeals,” Malik explained. He added that once the options of appeals were exhausted, then only the mercy appeal could be submitted to the army chief or the president as a last resort.     Imran has previously claimed that there is a plan to try him in the military court. He has claimed that Hameed was being forced to turn approver against him to pave the way for his trial in a military court on May 9 cases. "

  "description": "Two children and a woman were killed on Saturday while two policemen were among 13 people injured when a blast occurred at a main market near Surkhab Chowk in Balochistan’s Pishin district, hospital officials said. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks on police officials and checkposts, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Attacks escalated after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces. According to a list of the casualties issued by Dr Wakeel Sherani, the medical superintendent at Pishin Civil Hospital, two children were killed in today’s blast while 14 were initially injured. Thirteen of the wounded were referred to the Quetta Trauma Centre, where a woman succumbed to her injuries, a list issued by the hospital’s managing director Dr Arbab Kamran showed. Five injured people were in serious condition, two had minor injuries, the treatment of three was under way and two had been discharged from the Trauma Centre, the list stated. According to Pishin City Station House Officer (SHO) Mujibur Rehman, the two injured policemen were in critical condition. “Apparently, the explosive material was planted in a motorcycle,” SHO Rehman said, adding that as a result, three vehicles were damaged. The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Bomb Disposal Squad have reached the incident site to collect evidence for a probe, the official said. According to state broadcaster PTV News, the blast occurred near the Pishin deputy commissioner’s office.         The attack comes days after two pedestrians were injured in a roadside explosion in Noshki district, which the police said occurred when a convoy of Frontier Crops was passing by. Last month, a blast in Pishin caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) left three CTD officials and three pedestrians injured. Police officials had said the attack was aimed at a CTD vehicle carrying the department’s personnel. The same day, in a similar incident, a soldier of the Quick Response Force of the Frontier Corps South was martyred and seven others were injured in Kech district’s Buleda area. Condemnations pour in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the blast near police lines in Pishin, Radio Pakistan reported. Expressing deep grief and sorrow over the martyrdom of young children in the explosion, PM Shehbaz said “cowardly terrorists who attack young children do not deserve to be called humans”. The premier prayed for the recovery of the injured policemen and other people in the incident, directing that they be provided with the best possible medical treatment. PM Shehbaz called for those responsible for the incident to be identified and given exemplary punishment. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm commitment to the war against terrorism.         President Asif Ali Zardari also conveyed his sorrow over the incident to the bereaved families. “Those responsible should be given exemplary punishment according to the law,” President Zardari said in a statement, reiterating the resolve to continue operations against terrorists. He prayed for the deceased and their families. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the blast “near the Police Lines”, expressing grief over the loss of children’s lives. Extending his sympathies to the children’s families, Naqvi said in a statement: “This war [against terrorism] will continue till the terrorists and their enablers are eradicated.” He stressed that the fight was for “Pakistan’s honour and to give the future generations a peaceful and safe Pakistan”. Praying for the speedy recovery of the injured, he said the nation and the security forces stood together in the war against terrorism.         Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the blast, stating that the perpetrators wanted to ruin the province’s peace. “The courage of our security institutions cannot be diminished by such cowardly actions ,” CM Bugti asserted. “We will completely eradicate this sore of terrorism with the help of the public and the security forces,” the chief minister vowed. Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind condemned the “terrorist incidents in Pishin and Noshki”, regretting the loss of precious human lives. “Anti-society and anti-state elements do not deserve any concession,” Rind asserted. “Terrorists are targeting innocent and sinless people to achieve their nefarious goals,” he added. The spokesperson directed the provincial health department to provide the best medical facilities to those injured in the blast.  Additional input from Nadir Guramani "

  "description": "National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday issued a production order for PTI MNA Haji Imtiaz Ahmad Chaudhry after his party moved a privilege against several Punjab police officials. According to the motion moved by the PTI, Chaudhry was arrested by law enforcement authorities without obtaining prior approval from the speaker on July 24. Today, the speaker again issued a production order — an order was issued earlier but was reverted later — for the production of the PTI MNA on August 26 at 5pm.         “Honourable speaker considers [the] presence of Haji Imtiaz Ahmed Chaudhry … during the said session of the National Assembly necessary,” the order said. The speaker directed the director general of the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) to produce Chaudhry at the commencement of each NA sitting before the Parliament House’s sergeant-at-arms who will deliver the MNA into ACE custody after each NA sitting. The opposition lawmaker was in ACE custody on physical remand in connection with a graft case, facing charges of receiving Rs2 million commission in a development scheme. Gujranwala Headquarters Circle Officer (CO) Aftab Haider had told Gujrat police that an ACE team had taken the MNA to Mandi Bahauddin for the recovery of the “commission amount” he had allegedly received, adding that a sum of Rs300,000 had already been recovered from the suspect. However, the CO had said, that as the ACE team was bringing the lawmaker back to Gujranwala on July 31, around a dozen armed men in three vehicles intercepted the official vehicle on the new Shadiwal Road and opened indiscriminate fire. The CO had said that to save themselves from the bullets, the ACE officials left the vehicle to find shelter. Meanwhile, he had said, the armed men took away the MNA, who was still in the official vehicle, with them. Gujrat Saddar police registered a kidnapping case against the unidentified suspects under Sections 353, 324, 427, 186, 224, 225, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), on the report of ACE CO and started an investigation. On Aug 8, the Punjab ACE claimed to have rearrested the “missing” PTI MNA from Multan airport. The ACE spokesperson had said the lawmaker was trying to board a flight for Qatar when he was arrested at the Multan airport. Chaudhry was elected as an independent candidate (backed by the PTI) in the February 8 polls. Earlier, he had been elected as an MNA, for the first time, in the 2018 elections on the PTI ticket. "

  "description": "   Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and British High Commissioner Jane Marriott jointly launch the ‘District Education Performance Index’ in Islamabad on Friday. — INP  ISLAMABAD: An official report released on Friday placed the country’s education system in the ‘low’ performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve the education outcomes. The District Education Performance Index (DEPIx) Report 2020-23 released by the Planning Commission stated, “Pakistan’s national average score in the DEPIx is 53.46, placing the country in the “low” performance category. Among the five domains, infrastructure and access scored the highest at 58.95, indicating some progress in expanding educational opportunities. Inclusion (equity and technology) follows as the second-highest domain.“ It said public financing recorded the lowest score, highlighting the need for increased and better-targeted spending in the education sector. The learning domain also scores poorly, reflecting persistently low learning outcomes among students. “Governance and management, though slightly better than learning, still falls in the “low” category, mainly due to teacher shortages and high bureaucratic turnover,” it said.  None of 134 districts falls within ‘very high’ performance category, only Islamabad in ‘high’ category  The report said that over the past decades, the country has reached middle-income status and made commendable progress in developing its human capital. However, this progress has been slower than that of other developing countries and regional peers. The slow pace of human capital development poses challenges not only to realising the potential demographic dividend but also to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and attaining upper-middle-income status by 2047. The report said among the critical factors in human capital development, providing quality and inclusive education is paramount. In 2010, the parliament devolved policy, administrative and fiscal authority over education to the provinces and enshrined the right to free education as a fundamental right through Article 25-A of the Constitution. Since then, provincial governments have enacted compulsory education laws, increased budgetary allocations for school education and implemented various governance and data reforms. Notably, reforms in the education data regime have improved the availability of data on education indicators. Notwithstanding these efforts, the complexity, breadth and fragmentation of education data have often made it challenging for policymakers and stakeholders to use it effectively in decision-making. To address these issues and support the education emergency declared by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in May, the Planning Commission integrated various school education indicators into composite scorecards. The DEPIx is structured across five domains: infrastructure and access, learning, inclusion (equity and technology), governance and management and public financing. It covers 134 districts across Pakistan, including Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Punjab, Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). Besides highlighting the national overview, the report also included the provincial overview. It said Punjab emerged as the top-performing province with a composite score of 61.39 followed by KP with a score of 54.88 while Sindh and Balochistan lagged behind with scores of 51.49 and 45.70, respectively. Pertaining to the district-level insights, the report said none of the 134 districts fall within the “very high” performance category and only Islamabad falls into the “High” category, making it an outlier as the highest-performing districts. Alarmingly, the report adds that more than half of Pakistan’s districts (76) fall into the “Low” performance category. These low-performing districts are predominantly in Balochistan and Sindh with 33 districts in Balochistan and 22 in Sindh. Notably, all districts of Balochistan fall in the “Low” education performance category, indicating severe challenges across the province. Apart from the ICT, the top 10 districts are exclusively from Punjab and KP - seven from Punjab and two from KP. No districts from Sindh or Balochistan are represented among the top 10. Regarding the intra-provincial disparities, the report said significant variations in education performance exist within provinces. KP exhibits the greatest intra-provincial differences, with districts like Haripur, Chitral and Abbottabad among the top performers while Kolai Palas, Upper Kohistan and Lower Kohistan ranking among the lowest. There is nearly a 30-point gap between the best and worst-performing districts in KP. Punjab and Balochistan show the least intra-provincial variation, with Punjab’s districts mostly falling into the medium category and all of Balochistan’s districts in the low category. Sindh has moderate variation with most districts in the “low” category except for the urban districts of Karachi and Hyderabad. Published in Dawn, August 24th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Last rites of 12 cops martyred in Machka’s deadly rocket attack held • Police claim killing one dacoit, injuring five responsible for assault • 20 high-value targets marked as Punjab intensifies crackdown on Katcha outlaws • Sindh assures full support to Punjab counterparts    RAHIM YAR KHAN: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab IGP Dr Usman Anwar and other officials gather to offer funeral prayers of the martyred policemen at the Sadiq Shaheed Police Lines, on Friday.—AFP  RAHIM YAR KHAN/LAHORE/KARACHI: The last rites of 12 policemen, martyred in a deadly rocket ambush on the Punjab-Sindh border, were held on Friday as the Punjab government removed three police officers in Rahim Yar Khan and announced a bounty for the arrest of the hardened criminals behind the audacious attack. Meanwhile, Punjab Police claimed to have killed one dacoit and injured five others thought to be responsible for the attack on a police party in the riverine area of Machka. Thursday’s assault has been described as the deadliest attack carried out so far by gangs operating in the riverine areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur in south Punjab and Ghotki and Kashmore in Sindh. Accounts from injured personnel, who are under treatment at hospital, suggest that their vehicles had not broken down; rather they were ambushed by outlaws who were lying in wait in sugarcane fields along the roadside. Meanwhile, Sindh Police have assured their Punjab counterparts of full support in action against the criminal gangs operating in riverine areas, and Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn that future Punjab Police actions against these outlaws would have their full support. The Sindh police chief said that they were prepared to provide support by deploying forces on possible escape routes and providing armoured personnel carriers and other necessary equipment. High-value targets On Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced a Rs10 million bounty for high-value targets among the dacoits, and Rs5m to Rs2.5m for other dangerous robbers operating in the Katcha areas. “We have marked 20 high-value targets in the Katcha areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur,” Ins­pe­ctor General of Police Dr Usman Anwar told Dawn.         The provincial police chief said that police had made progress and claimed the killing of hardened dacoit Bashir Shar during a hot pursuit. Shar is said to be one of the men behind Thursday’s attack on the police party. Dr Anwar said that five of Shar’s accomplices, including Sanaullah Shar, Gada Ali, Kamlu Shar, Ramzan Shar and Gadi were also injured in the police’s action. “The next target is another most wanted dacoit and we are vigorously pursuing him in the riverine area of Rahim Yar Khan,” he said. The provincial police chief reached Rahim Yar Khan along with the additional inspector general of the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department and other senior police officers late on Thursday night. Senior representatives from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Branch, Rangers and other security agencies were also present. CM Maryam Nawaz had directed the police chief to remain in Rahim Yar Khan until Sunday, and tasked him with leading a large-scale operation, launched in coordination of the Sindh police. Action was initiated against Rahim Yar Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Imran Ahmad Malik over his alleged failure to ensure the safe and secure movement of local police as per standard guidelines in the troubled area. In a notification on Friday night, the Punjab government transferred Punjab CTD SSP Rizwan Umar Gondal as the new DPO of Rahim Yar Khan. This is Mr Gondal’s second posting as Rahim Yar Khan DPO — he had previously led a major operation against Katcha outlaws there in 2023, which spanned several weeks and was deemed a success. He has also headed Mianwali police, another district where such criminals are a massive headache. Deployment Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn on Friday that the forces of both provinces had coordination under which they shared intelligence information about the bandits.      Subsequently, a red alert was issued and police officials were deployed on possible escape routes by both provinces. He recalled that in the past, when a Punjab Police team went deep into the Katcha area and got stuck they were assisted by Sindh, which sent in APCs and cut off the supply lines of the criminal gangs. After Thursday’s tragic incident, he said, Sindh Police also deployed APCs and additional equipment to help with the retrieval process. However, he pointed out that there was no clear demarcation of areas in the riverine belt and pointed out that if certain islands were in one province, its peripheral areas were located in another province. Now, it has been decided to further enhance the coordination in the areas around the Sindh-Punjab border, he said. IGP Memon revealed that criminals use bunkers dotted around the Katcha area to hide from and engage law enforcers, as well as take cover in forested areas or remote islands in the Indus. Law enforcement sources said the use of rocket launchers by the outlaws had sent alarm bells ringing as such weapons were mostly used by terrorists, including the proscribed BLA and other outfits operating in Balochistan. They said the senior police officers wanted collaborated action by other provinces in order to yield positive results. Punjab Police have now recalled 199 police personnel of the Punjab Constabulary (PC) from Rahim Yar Khan and directed them to report to their parent districts of Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur. They will replace them with PC personnel belonging to the Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts. Funerals The last rites of the 12 martyred policemen were offered at Sadiq Shaheed Police Lines in Rahim Yar Khan on Friday.            View this post on Instagram              Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, IGP Dr Usman Anwar, Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal, army and police officers, relatives of the martyrs and members of the public attended the funerals. While 11 of the policemen were martyred in a battle with the outlaws, while one passed away on the way to the hospital. After a police contingent presented a guard of honour to the martyrs, their bodies were dispatched to their native areas for burial. Published in Dawn, August 24th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: PTI’s much hyped Aug 22 rally in Islamabad was cancelled to avoid May 9-like violence, former premier Imran Khan said on Friday and declared that the power show would now be held on Sept 8. Talking to media persons after hearing in the GBP190 million corruption case at the accountability court inside the Adiala jail, Mr Khan explained the reason behind his early morning meeting with Azam Khan Swati on Aug 22. He said that during the meeting Mr Swati informed him about the protests planned by other political and religious parties in Islamabad the same day. In reply to a question whether Mr Swati had acted as a messenger between him and some government functionaries, the PTI leader called the government a product of Form-47 with which he would not negotiate.  Defends call for Faiz’s open trial; alleges govt will ignore seniority rule if CJP doesn’t get extension; warns against hurdles to Sept 8 rally  Mr Khan said whenever the government thought he was in contact with the establishment it started raising the bogey of the May 9 episode. He said that in order to avoid chaos the Aug 22 jalsa had been postponed, because there was a possibility of a May 9-like incident. He pointed out that PTI had been demanding a judicial probe into the violence. However, he said, the party would bring rallies to Islamabad on Sept 8 and “I have told the party leaders not to tolerate any hurdle in the way of holding a power show”.      He described the cancellation of the no-objection certificate issued to PTI for holding the rally as a question mark on the credibility of judiciary, wondering how could the district administration cancel the NOC issued with the permission of the court. Mr Khan said he had also instructed the party leaders to hold a meeting and decide a date for protest over the delay by the Supreme Court in issuing the detailed judgement in reserved seats case. In response to criticism of his demand for open trial of former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, the ex-PM said that being the head of country’s largest political party he could seek open proceedings of the military court as the allegation is very serious that he had hatched the conspiracy with ex-spymaster for the May 9 violence. He insisted that it is neither an internal issue of the military nor falls within the ambit of the Official Secrets Act, adding that the open trial would be beneficial for the country. He said if the recommendations of the Hamoodur Rehman Commission were implemented, there would have been no martial law afterwards. Mr Khan alleged that Nawaz Sharif is ready to fly back to London. The PTI chief claimed that the government is working on the extension of incumbent Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, adding that in case they failed to do so then they would manipulate to elevate the person of their choice by bypassing the seniority rule.

  "description": "   A team comprising one Russian and four local climbers pose near the Pakistan Army helicopter before their departure from Skardu to participate in the rescue operation on Gasherbrum IV. — Dawn  GILGIT: Two Russian climbers rescued from the altitude of 6,400 metres on Gasherbrum IV (7,925m) were finally airlifted to Skardu on Thursday. The Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) appreciated the role of local rescue team members who risked their lives to save the stranded climbers. Mikhail Mironov and Sergei Mironov were part of a five-member Russian team who started their attempt to ascend Gasherbrum IV on August 4 to retrieve the body of their fellow climber Dmitry Golovchenko, who went missing there in 2023. On August 17, however, the Russian team was hit by a snow avalanche at 6,400m. As a result, two of the climbers got stranded after being injured while two others, Alexy Bautin and Evgeni Lablokov, remained unhurt and were later rescued by the army and airlifted to Skardu on Sunday. One of their partners, Sergei Nilov, who went missing has lost his life, the rescued climbers announced. According to ACP Secretary Karar Haidri, the rescue operation was carried out by a dedicated team of Yousuf Ali, Mohammad Ali, Ghulam Abbas and Mohammad Younus from Baltistan and Evgeni Lablokov from Russia. The team members were dropped by Army helicopters at an altitude of 6,000 metres on Monday. Renowned climber Naila Kiani told Dawn that Mohammad Younus and Ghulam Abbas played a vital role in rescuing the stranded climbers. She said Younus and Abbas reached 6,400 metres despite the challenging weather and snow avalanche risks on Tuesday while the other members remained at the advance base camp as backup members. The two team members brought down the climbers to 6000 meters the same day. Ms Kiani said Mikhail Mironov had a minor injury and travelled himself with the help of the rescue team; however, Sergey Mironov was not able to move and pulled through ropes by putting him in a sleeping mat. On Wednesday, helicopters couldn’t operate due to bad weather conditions. On Thursday morning, the Army helicopters flew from Skardu and airlifted the climbers to Skardu. The four Russian climbers reached Islamabad on a PIA flight from Skardu on Friday. A tour operator told Dawn that the condition of both the climbers was stable. Mikhail Mironov was admitted to the regional headquarters hospital Skardu where doctors said he had a fracture in his spinal cord. The ACP secretary said despite their best efforts the team was unable to locate Sergei Nilov. He appreciated the bravery of the team in saving the injured stranded climbers. It is rare to rescue injured climbers from a high altitude, he added. The rescued climbers appreciated the role of the Army and local rescue team members for their efforts to save their lives from the dangerous zone. Published in Dawn, August 24th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Following a me­­e­­ting between the PTI and JUI-F on Friday night, the former clai­med that both sides had decided to cooperate with each other on an “issue to issue and agenda to agenda” basis. The remarks by PTI leader Asad Qaiser came after a PTI delegation led by party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan called on JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence in an effort to forge unity among the opposition parties ahead of the upcoming crucial sessions of the National Assembly and Senate.         Talking to Dawn after the meeting, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said the two parties had decided to cooperate with each other on the “issue to issue and agenda to agenda” basis. As the first phase of their joint strategy, they had decided to make efforts to block “controversial” legislations that the government was planning to bring to parliament next week, he added. There was no official word from the JUI-F after the talks.  Gohar holds talks with Fazl; no word from JUI-F about outcome of meeting  Besides Mr Qaiser, Shibli Faraz and Information Secretary Raoof Hasan were part of the PTI’s delegation whereas Maulana Fazl was assisted by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Akhunzada Hus­sain Yousafzai and Aslam Ghouri. The meeting took place hours after the government convened the sessions of the National Assembly and Senate on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Mr Qaiser said both sides had nominated their respective representatives in the National Assem­bly and the Senate to devise a joint strategy in the two houses of parliament. He said Barrister Gohar, an MNA, and Senator Faraz had been nominated by the PTI whereas MNA Ghafoor Haideri and Senator Kamran Murtaza had been given the task by the JUI-F for coordination in the two houses. The meeting between the two parties is being seen as a significant development by political experts after a categorical announcement by the JUI-F chief that he would not become part of any alliance in light of his past experiences with such alliances.      In an interaction with journalists at his Dera Ismail Khan residence on Aug 20, Maulana Fazl had stated that JUI-F would take a solo flight against the government, though its cooperation with opposition parties on issues of mutual concerns would continue. Maulana Fazl, who headed the Pakistan Democratic Movement against the PTI government, said he would run a movement against the incumbent government alone while continuing to cooperate with opposition parties on common issues. Speaking about talks with PTI on that occasion, he had said that JUI-F had “deep ideological differences” with PTI and still held that belief. However, his position on some issues was the same as the PTI’s. He had stated that instead of a comprehensive political alliance with PTI, issue-based talks with the opposition party were ongoing. When asked about the Maul­a­na’s remarks, Asad Qaiser said that during Friday’s meeting they had not discussed any plan to form any formal alliance. He added that for the time being, they had only agreed to cooperate with each other on an “agenda to agenda basis” in parliament. Published in Dawn, August 24th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Sindh, Balochistan, south Punjab districts to receive downpour • Authorities advised to prepare for flash floods, torrents • Activist blames PDMA inaction for extensive damage in Nasirabad RAWALPINDI: The Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has issued a forecast for torrential rains, especially in the southern region, from August 25 to 29. In an advisory issued on Friday, PMD said a low-pressure weather system, currently located over West Bengal, is likely to move westwards during the next couple of days and may reach the country’s southern coasts on Aug 25. Under the influence of this weather system, strong monsoon currents could result in rainfall, wind and thundershower in Karachi, Hydera­bad, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Shaheed Benazir­abad, Jam­shoro, Tando Allahyar, Tando Mohammad Khan, Thar­parkar, Nagarparkar, Mithi, Mirpurkhas, Umarkot, Mat­iari, Sanghar, Sukkur, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Khair­pur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Nausharo Feroze from Aug 25 to 29 with occasional gaps. In Balochistan, similar weather is expected in Khuzdar, Kalat, Lasbela, Awaran, Nasirabad, Sibi, Jaffarbad, Kohlu, Harnai, Dera Bugti, Zhob, Quetta, Ziarat, Sherani, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Barkhan, Loralai, Mastung, Bolan, Jhal Magsi, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar, Jiwani, Pasni and Ormara from Aug 26 to 30. In Punjab and Islamabad, downpour is expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Attock, Chakwal, Talagang, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafiz­abad, Wazirabad, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Sheikhu­pura, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Pakpattan, Kasur, Khushab, Sargodha, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Multan, Khanewal, Lodhran, Muzaffargarh, Kot Addu, Bahawalpur, Bahawal­nagar, Khanpur and Rahim Yar Khan from August 25 to 28.      The northern parts of the country Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur, Diamer, Astore, Skardu, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar will receive rainfall from Aug 25 to 28. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Shangla, Batta­gram, Buner, Kohat, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Swabi, Nowshera, Mardan, Charsadda, Hangu, Kurram, Orakzai, Waziristan, Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan will remain under the influence of similar weather from Aug 26 to 28. Flash flooding, landslides The Met Office has warned of flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab, along with flash floods in urban centres. Hill torrents are expected in D.G Khan, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibi, Nasirabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbela; and coastal flooding along the Sindh-Makran coast from August 26 to 29. Heavy rains may trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and GB. The advisory warned that heavy downpours, windstorms and lightning may damage mud houses, electricity infrastructure, and roads. Farmers and tourists have been advised to plan their activities in light of the forecast. In light of the forecast, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday warned of flooding in south Punja and in the Koh-i-Sulaiman and Kirthar ranges. The local administrations of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur have been asked to make arrangements to deal with possible flash flooding due to hill torrents. PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia has instructed the officials to remain on high alert and ensure round-the-clock monitoring of the situation. Meanwhile, Lahore’s weather turned balmy on Friday, with some parts receiving rainfall while the sun remained out in other localities. Gulberg, Model Town, Faisal Town, Canal Road, F.C. College, Jail Road, Shadman, Township, Kot Lakhpat, Peco Road, Green Town, and Johar Town received rainfall. Damages in Balochistan An activist from Nasirabad, Balochistan, has decried the damages in the area due to rainfall and flooding during the recent monsoon season and blamed the authorities for not taking any action to protect life and properties. While addressing a press conference in Quetta on Friday, Hameeda Noor, a human rights activist and social worker from Nasirabad, said that the region has suffered extensive damages during the recent monsoon.      He said damages were still being counted, and the relevant departments and authorities were not present in the area to provide relief to people. She said Balochistan PDMA, which is responsible for taking measures to protect people from climate change, remained ineffective in performing its duty. “PDMA must play its role in taking precautionary measures before rains hit an area and the government should allocate resources for this purpose,” Ms Noor added. She said the Nasirabad region is called the ‘green belt of Balochistan’, but it has not received adequate attention from the authorities. Every year, natural disasters endanger thousands of lives, property, fertile lands, and crops in Nasirabad, Sibi, and Kalat divisions in Balochistan. She lamented that the delayed construction of the Kachhi Canal was exacerbating the flood situation. She said the drainage system of small canals in Jaffarabad directly flows into Sindh via the Khirthar Canal, but the local politicians and landlords in Balochistan and Sindh “forcefully block the drainage paths”. As a result, breaches occur in various small and large water channels and submerge the adjacent areas. Imran Gabol in Lahore and Saleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, August 24th, 2024 "

APPAmid speculations that the ruling coalition is planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in parliament, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting...",
  "content": "Amid speculations that the ruling coalition is planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in parliament, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar rejected the reports stating that constitutional amendment cannot be introduced in the joint sitting. Tarar made the statement amid rumours that incumbent government mulling amendments to extend the tenure of the judges and, make changes in the laws related to the top jurists' appointments based on the principle of seniority. The speculations gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 to introduce key legislation.  When questioned about the constitutional amendments in the pipeline on Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. He further clarified that no constitutional amendment could be introduced during a joint session of the parliament. The federal minister added that there was neither any amendment pertaining to the judiciary under consideration nor the judges' extension. \"Legislative Committee did not discuss any amendment regarding the judiciary in recent days,\" he said. The information minister said that the speculations were fictitious as President Asif Ali Zardari summoned a routine session of the parliament. He, however, confirmed that there was a chance for a joint session next week in which the legislators would take up some pending bills. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now. Clearing the air about the CJP's appointment, the minister said that they were not considering any recommendation to issue a notification of the next chief justice's appointment early. It is worth mentioning that prior to the expected joint parliament session, President Zardari also summoned the session of the National Assembly on August 26 (Monday) and the Senate on August 27 (Tuesday) under Article 54(1) of the Constitution. Ahead of the crucial sessions, the ruling PML-N also took its key ally PPP into confidence on the key legislation, the source told Geo News after PM Shehbaz Sharif and PPP chief Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari met earlier this week. Earlier today, President Zardari also held an important meeting with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at the latter’s residence in Islamabad amid reports of the joint sitting taking place next week. The meeting between Zardari and Maulana Fazl was held just a day after the latter \"reached a consensus\" on cooperation with the major opposition party — Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — in the National Assembly and the Senate. In the key meeting, the Imran-founded party and the Fazl-led religio-political party agreed on cooperating each other on the parliamentary front. The speculations of the CJP’s extension emerged a few months ago which drew serious concerned from the embattled former ruling party as it strongly opposed the coalition government’s likely move. However, responding to the PTI’s allegations, Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had rejected the rumours and said that CJP Isa was not interested in extension. He, however, confirmed last month that the federal government was working on pension reforms, which included a suggestion for increasing the age of retirement by two years across all sectors, including judges, as per The News report."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of government summoning a joint session of parliament for the passage of key legislation, President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday held meeting with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The president along with Minister for Interior Senator Mohsin Naqvi arrived at Fazl's residence in the federal capital. The meeting was also attended by JUI-F leaders including Maulana Abdul Ghafoor, Maulana Asad Mehmood, Aslam Ghauri and Engineer Ziaur Rehman. Both leaders held detailed deliberation on potential key legislation likely to be tabled in the joint sitting next week. Without divulging details of the legislation, the sources said important matters including current political situation also came under discussion. During the meeting, Zardari also gifted a gun to Maulana Fazl. Meanwhile, the federal government has reportedly decided to summon the joint session of parliament on August 28. Sources claimed that the lawmakers have been instructed to ensure their presence in the meeting. President Zardari has also summoned the session of the National Assembly on August 26 (Monday) and the Senate on August 27 (Tuesday) under Article 54(1) of the Constitution. The meeting came two days after after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to deliberate on the ongoing political situation and discuss potential key legislation. Sources told Geo News that the coalition government led by PM Shehbaz took the PPP leadership into confidence on the \"important legislation\". It is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and JUI-F had reached a consensus on cooperation in the National Assembly and the Senate. The consensus was reached following PTI leaders' meeting with Fazl at the latter’s residence a day earlier. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said that it was a meeting between leadership of two parties adding that negotiating teams of two sides would continue to meet and move forward in the National Assembly and the Senate with mutual consultation. For his part, JUI-F's Ziaur Rehman noted that the parties' committees will decide matters regarding legislative issues in the National Assembly and the Senate. Rehman further said that a two-member committee comprising Senators Shibli Faraz and Kamran Murtaza will deal with legislative matters in the upper house."

  "content": "As Islamabad and New Delhi continue to have strained ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently used the Pakistani airspace, aviation sources told Geo News on Saturday. Sources affiliated with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) revealed that an aircraft carrying Modi passed through Pakistani airspace on its way back to New Delhi from Poland. The aircraft entered the Pakistani airspace at 10:15am and left at 11:01am after spending 46 minutes in the Pakistani airspace. The sources said the Indian premier's plane entered Pakistani airspace via Chitral and passed through air control areas of Islamabad and Lahore before entering India's Amritsar. Modi visited the Polish capital Warsaw en route to Kyiv, to meet the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In March 2019, Pakistan lifted all airspace restrictions for civilian flights, reopening a key transit air corridor over its territory almost five months after closing it in the wake of a military standoff with India triggered by ab attack on security convoy that killed 44 paramilitary police in India Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Subsequently, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties and suspended bilateral trade with India after the Modi-led government abrogated the semi-autonomous status of the IIOJK in August 2019."

The weather forecast department informed in its latest update that a new rain system located over west Bengal is likely to move westwards during the next couple of days, which would bring strong monsoon currents in Pakistan's southern parts on the night of August 25. It added that heavy rains were expected from August 26 to 29 under this system, prompting the concerned authorities to take emergency measures. Taking the predictions into account, Wahab announced that a rain emergency has been imposed to deal with the post-rain situation in the metropolis.  He added that instructions were given to the municipal services of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and leaves of all concerned staffers were suspended to cope with the expected rains. As per the Met Office, the areas in Sindh that are likely to receive showers include Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allayar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tharparkar, Nagarparkar, Mithi, Mirpur Khas, Umarkot, Matiari, Sanghar, Sukkur, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Khairpur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Naushero Feroze.

  "content": "KARACHI: Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon has reached the decision to constitute a special probe team to investigate the Karsaz traffic accident case against a female driver. The Sindh IG said since police were treating it as a high-profile case, therefore, an officer of senior superintendent of police (SSP) rank would collaborate with the investigating team. On August 19, the suspect's SUV rammed into other vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum, killing an elderly man and a young woman — father and daughter. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. The suspect was identified in the first information report (FIR) as \"Natasha\", who was sent to jail on judicial remand by a court in Karachi on August 21. Meanwhile, sources involved in the investigation told Geo News the woman’s medical report was delayed and it could take two to three more days to it to be received. The sources said the suspect’s blood samples were sent to two different laboratories for further development in the investigation. It was decided that a sample would be sent to a laboratory in Lahore as well, they said. They said details about route of Natasha’s vehicle were also obtained. As per the details, she left her house in the KDA Scheme-I for her mother-in-law’s house, situated at a distance of about 3-4 kilometers, they maintained. The sources said the suspect kept changing her statement during the investigation. While, they said, they were trying to verify the report about her holding a driving license and citizenship of a foreign country. According to the investigative sources, charges in the case were altered and the case was weakened by imposing Section 320 — which pertains to 'unintentional murder' (qatl bil khata) by negligent driving. However, Section 322 of murder had been added in the case, the sources maintained. Section 322 states punishment about 'murder on purpose' (qatl bil sabab) which may be punishable by 10-18 years imprisonment in addition to the diyat money. The family members could opt for the diyat money equivalent to 30,360 grams of silver, the sources said. They said according to the current price of silver, amount of diyat would be Rs6.85 million. If the diyat money was accepted, the case would be disposed of, they maintained. The sources stressed that the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the penal code for offences charged in the country, needed to be amended as it was prepared in 1860. “Due to lack of amendment in Pakistan Penal Code, cases are weakened,” they said."

  "content": "KILLA ABDULLAH: Multiple cash prizes have been announced for an excavator driver, as well as scholarship for his son, over his valiant act of rescuing a family stuck in flash flood in Killa Abdullah. The excavator operator, Mohibullah, rescued five family members, including three children and a woman, who were travelling in a car that got stuck in severe flooding in Toba Achakzai area on August 19. He risked his own life to carry out the rescue mission by himself. The Quetta corps commander gave Mohibullah Rs0.5 million cash prize, whereas the Balochistan government announced educational scholarship for his son under the Balochistan Education Programme. As people feared to help the family stuck in the flash flood, Mohibullah rode a bike to home and brought an excavator. In the video circulating on social media, he can be seen skillfully maneuvering the machine to bring the vehicle to dry land. People from across the country have widely appreciated this valiant act. Meanwhile, Hilal-e-Ahmar Balochistan Chairman Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai and Awami National Party (ANP) member of the Balochistan Assembly Zamrak Khan Achakzai announced Rs0.2 million each for the rescuer. Achakzai also announced that he would hold an event in honour of Mohibullah upon his arrival in Quetta. Killa Abdullah Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Farooq gave appreciation certificate and cash prize during an event at his office held to appreciate the excavator operator. Talking to Geo News, Mohibullah said when he reached near the vehicle he heard children crying. He thought he would at least try to rescue the family if he could not pull the vehicle out of the flood. “Allah blessed me with an unseen help [to save the family],” he said. He said the vehicle’s owner wanted to give him all the money he had with him but he refused to take it as he did it for Allah. "

  "content": "QUETTA: At least three people — two children and a woman — died while 14 others sustained injuries in an explosion on Saturday near a police line in Balochistan's city of Pishin, Geo News reported citing police officials. The injured, which include policemen, are being shifted to the hospital with some of them in critical condition, said the law enforcement agency.  Seven policemen were among those injured when the remote-controlled bomb, attached to a motorcycle, detonated, the city's senior superintendent of police, Manzoor Buledi, told Reuters. \"Explosives were planted in a motorcycle which was parked in the area,\" said police officer Mujeeb-Ur-Rehman.  According to PTV News, the blast occurred near the Pishin's deputy commissioner's office.  Medical superintendent of Pishin Hospital, Dr Wakeel Sherani, said 13 wounded were moved to Quetta after receiving first aid while the bodies of the children and one of the injured are in the hospital.  One of the injured, who was shifted to the trauma center Quetta in critical condition, lost her life, said the hospital sources. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the blast in Pishin resulting in the killing of innocent children. Expressing deep sorrow and grief, President Zardari extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue fight against terrorism, directing the relevant authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also offered his condolences and directed the authorities concerned to provide best possible medical treatment to the injured. He said those responsible for the incident should be identified and given exemplary punishment. Condemning the incident, spokesperson of the Balochistan government said that they regret the loss of precious human lives in terrorist incident.  Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the blast, saying that the anarchists want to destroy the peace of the province.  \"The morale of the security agencies cannot be undermined by cowardly acts. The scourge of terrorism will be eradicated with the help of security forces,\" he added.  Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in militant attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, since the banned outfit, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) put the truce with Islamabad to an end. KP and Balochistan — both bordering Afghanistan — were the epicenters of violence during the second quarter of 2024, accounting for nearly 92% of all fatalities and 87% of attacks (including incidents of terrorism and security forces operations).  Individually, the former suffered 67% and the latter 25% of all fatalities in Q2, 2024. "

  "content": "Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Production Saif Anjum has confirmed that the federal government is considering to shut down utility stores across the country.  \"The government wants to get out from unnecessary businesses,\" the secretary said while confirming the development during a meeting of Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Production on Friday.  Responding to Senator Saifullah Niazi's query, Saif Anjum said that work was underway to transfer the employees of the utility stores to other departments. He added that providing subsidy to the utility stores was detrimental to competition in market.  Meanwhile, the utility stores management said they were given a two-week deadline to wrap up issues with companies while the Rs50 billion subsidy, which previously offered significant relief to around 26 million deserving households, has been halted. The management further said over 11,000 employees, which including 6,000 permanent staff, are worried over the potential closure.  Speaking to Geo News, Atif Shah — General Secretary of All Pakistan Workers Alliance — said that the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) wasn't a burden on national exchequer. \"The government collects Rs120 billion in taxes annually from companies in form of groceries sale,\" he said, noting that Rs25 billion was being paid by USC which according to him makes 18% of the total amount. Furthermore, Shah said they don't take funds from the government and salaries of all employees are \"self-generated\". He claimed that the government owes Rs20 billion to the corporation. Meanwhile, the USC management has decided to seek help from parliament with sources claiming that they would reach out to National Assembly and Senate's Standing Committees on Industries and Production. The standing committees would be apprised of the impacts of utility stores closure, sources said, adding that they would be asked to take up the issue in parliament. The move would severely impact millions of low-income families who have long relied on discounted goods, the sources added. The government's decision also prompted protests as utility stories employees have staged a protest outside their regional office at Scheme Mor in Lahore. The protesters, carrying placards and chanting slogans, demanded the government revert its decision. "

APPConstitutional amendment can't be introduce in joint session: Tarar.Confirms extension in judges' tenure was discussed a few months ago.\"President Asif Ali Zardari...",
  "content": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar has clarified that the federal government is not considering any option to extend judges' tenure, rebutting speculations that the federal government is planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in parliament. Tarar made the statement amid rumours that incumbent government mulling amendments to extend the tenure of the judges and, make changes in the laws related to the top jurists appointments based on the principle of seniority. The speculations gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 to introduce key legislation.  When questioned about the constitutional amendments in the pipeline on Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. He further clarified that no constitutional amendment could be introduced during a joint session of the parliament. The federal minister added that there was neither any amendment pertaining to the judiciary under consideration nor the judges' extension. \"Legislative Committee did not discuss any amendment regarding the judiciary in recent days,\" he said. The information minister said that the speculations were fictitious as President Asif Ali Zardari summoned a routine session of the parliament. He, however, confirmed that there was a chance for a joint session next week in which the legislators would take up some pending bills. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now. Clearing the air about the CJP's appointment, the minister said that they were not considering any recommendation to issue a notification of the next chief justice's appointment early. It is worth mentioning that prior to the expected joint parliament session, President Zardari also summoned the session of the National Assembly on August 26 (Monday) and the Senate on August 27 (Tuesday) under Article 54(1) of the Constitution. Ahead of the crucial sessions, the ruling PML-N also took its key ally PPP into confidence on the key legislation, the source told Geo News after PM Shehbaz Sharif and PPP chief Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari met earlier this week. Earlier today, President Zardari also held an important meeting with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at the latter’s residence in Islamabad amid reports of the joint sitting taking place next week. The meeting between Zardari and Maulana Fazl was held just a day after the latter \"reached a consensus\" on cooperation with the major opposition party — Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — in the National Assembly and the Senate. In the key meeting, the Imran-founded party and the Fazl-led religio-political party agreed on cooperating each other on the parliamentary front. The speculations of the CJP’s extension emerged a few months ago which drew serious concerned from the embattled former ruling party as it strongly opposed the coalition government’s likely move. However, responding to the PTI’s allegations, Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had rejected the rumours and said that CJP Isa was not interested in extension. He, however, confirmed last month that the federal government was working on pension reforms, which included a suggestion for increasing the age of retirement by two years across all sectors, including judges, as per The News report."

  "content": " Archrivals Pakistan and India have witnessed no change in their strained diplomatic ties for years, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently used Pakistani airspace, aviation sources told Geo News on Saturday. Sources affiliated with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) revealed that an aircraft carrying Modi passed through Pakistani airspace on its way back to New Delhi from Poland. The aircraft entered the Pakistani airspace at 10:15am and left at 11:01am after spending 46 minutes in the Pakistani airspace. The sources said the Indian premier's plane entered Pakistani airspace via Chitral and passed through air control areas of Islamabad and Lahore before entering India's Amritsar.  Modi visited the Polish capital Warsaw en route to Kyiv, to meet the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  In March 2019, Pakistan lifted all airspace restrictions for civilian flights, reopening a key transit air corridor over its territory almost five months after closing it in the wake of a military standoff with India triggered by ab attack on security convoy that killed 44 paramilitary police in India Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).  Subsequently, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties and suspended bilateral trade with India after the Modi-led government abrogated the semi-autonomous status of the IIOJK in August 2019."

  "content": "KARACHI: Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab on Saturday imposed a rain emergency as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted heavy downpours in southern parts of the country, including the port city next week under the influence of a low-pressure weather system. The weather forecast department informed in its latest update that a new rain system located over west Bengal is likely to move westwards during the next couple of days, which would bring strong monsoon currents in Pakistan's southern parts on the night of August 25. It added that heavy rains were expected from August 26 to 29 under this system, prompting the concerned authorities to take emergency measures. Taking the predictions into account, Karachi Mayor Wahab on Saturday announced that a rain emergency has been imposed to deal with the post-rain situation in the metropolis.  He added that instructions were given to the municipal services of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and leaves of all concerned staffers were suspended to cope with the expected rains.

  "content": "A new report has highlighted Pakistan’s educational plight, showing that the country’s institutions imparting knowledge do not meet the required standards. The District Education Performance Index (DEPIx) Report 2023 unveiled on Friday showed that the national average score for the overall index is 53.46 (out of a 100), which places Pakistan in the “Low” performance category. The groundbreaking report developed by the Planning Commission, reveals striking disparities in education performance across Pakistan’s provinces and districts.  This first-of-its-kind tool measures district-level education performance, focusing on key outcomes such as access, learning, equity, governance, and inputs such as infrastructure and public financing.  Covering 134 districts, including Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and all districts in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Punjab, and Sindh, DEPIx classifies districts into four categories: Very High, High, Medium, and Low. The report primarily covers the period from 2020-23.  Among the provinces, Punjab emerged as the top performer with a composite score of 61.39. KP follows with an average score of 54.47, while Sindh and Balochistan lag behind with scores of 51.55 and 45.50, respectively. The DEPIx covers 134 districts across Pakistan, and the results reveal significant challenges in education delivery nationwide. Notably, none of the districts achieve the “Very High” performance category, indicating that even the best-performing districts fail to meet the optimal benchmarks for education performance. Furthermore, none of the districts, except Islamabad, fall into the “High” category, making ICT an outlier and the highest performer across the country. Alarmingly, more than half of the districts in Pakistan (77) are categorised as “Low” in education performance. This group collectively accounts for about 25.6 million children (approximately 36% of the country’s school-age population). The majority of these low-performing districts are concentrated in Balochistan and Sindh, with 33 districts in Balochistan and 22 in Sindh, underscoring substantial inter-provincial disparities in education. Particularly concerning is the fact that all districts of Balochistan fall into the “Low” category. Nearly two-fifths (56) of Pakistan’s districts are classified in the “Medium” category, with scores ranging between 55 and 70. These districts are spread across Punjab, KP, and Sindh. Punjab leads with the highest number of districts in this category, totaling 32, followed by KP with 16 districts, and Sindh with 8. With the exception of ICT, the 10 highest-scored districts in Pakistan are exclusively from Punjab and KP, with 7 of these from Punjab and 2 from KP. Notably, no districts from Sindh and Balochistan are represented among the highest-scored 10 districts. The strong performance in the top-ranked 10 districts can largely be attributed to high scores in the Infrastructure & Access domain, averaging at 82.43, followed by the Inclusion (Equity & Technology) domain at an average of 78.29. Conversely, even the country’s highest-scoring districts struggle in the Public Financing domain, with only 3 out of the 10 exceeding a score of 50 on this domain, and the overall average score for the top 10 districts at 47.48. Public financing also shows the second-widest variation (18.10 points) among the highest performing districts, ranging from ICT’s 55.97 to Rawalpindi’s 37.87. These findings underscore the need for greater focus on increasing education financing and improving its efficiency. In the Learning domain, only Rawalpindi and ICT score above 60, and the average across all 10 districts is only 56.66. The lowest-scoring 10 districts paint a stark contrast, with Balochistan disproportionately represented, accounting for 6 of these districts. Sindh and KP each contribute two districts to this group. Infrastructure & Access, a strength for the top-ranked districts, emerges as the most significant weakness for the lowest-scored ones. With an average score of 36.39 in this domain, all these districts, with the exception of Chagai, perform worse on Infrastructure & Access than their overall index score. Meanwhile, Governance & Management emerges as the domain with the highest average across the lowest-scored districts, coming out at 48.36 compared to the national average of 56.18 for this domain."

  "content": "KARACHI: Inspector General of Sindh Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon has decided to form a special investigation team to probe the Karsaz road accident case against a woman driver. The IGP said an officer of senior superintendent of police (SSP) rank would work with the investigation team, as they were taking it as a high-profile case.  A young daughter and an elderly father were killed on August 19 when the suspect's SUV car crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. The suspect was identified in the first information report (FIR) as \"Natasha\", who was sent to jail on judicial remand by a court in Karachi on August 21. Meanwhile, sources involved in the investigation told Geo News the woman’s medical report was delayed and it could take two to three more days to it to be received. The sources said the suspect’s blood samples were sent to two different laboratories for further development in the investigation. It was decided that a sample would be sent to a laboratory in Lahore as well, they said. They said details about route of Natasha’s vehicle were also obtained. As per the details, she left her house in the KDA Scheme-I for her mother-in-law’s house, situated at a distance of about 3-4 kilometers, they maintained.  The sources said the suspect kept changing her statement during the investigation.  While, they said, they were trying to verify the report about her holding a driving license and citizenship of a foreign country.  According to the investigative sources, charges in the case were altered and the case was weakened by imposing Section 320 — which pertains to 'unintentional murder' (qatl bil khata) by negligent driving. However, Section 322 of murder had been added in the case, the sources maintained. Section 322 states punishment about 'murder on purpose' (qatl bil sabab) which may be punishable by 10-18 years imprisonment in addition to the diyat money.  The family members could opt for the diyat money equivalent to 30,360 grams of silver, the sources said. They said according to the current price of silver, amount of diyat would be Rs6.85 million. If the diyat money was accepted, the case would be disposed of, they maintained. The sources stressed that the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the penal code for offences charged in the country, needed to be amended as it was prepared in 1860. “Due to lack of amendment in Pakistan Penal Code, cases are weakened,” they said."

  "content": "Pakistani advertisement agency, The D’Hamidi Partnership, is part of the Worldwide Partners Inc. — world’s largest network of independent agencies — on the basis of creativity, depth of specialisation and breadth of portfolio. There are only 90 such agencies in the world, across 45 countries, with $5 billion in combined billings that are challenging the holding company agency model through collaboration, co-creation, category specialisation, and speed to market. “These agencies undergo a rigorous selection process, and we have been extremely honored to be selected among them. It’s a feather in the cap for Pakistani creativity,” D'Hamidi's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Faraz Maqsood Hamidi told Geo.tv. Shedding light on its partnership, Faraz said WPI is the only network comprised of the world’s top independent agencies who are collectively powered by partnership and designed for growth.  \"With over 90 agencies in more than 45 countries, and experience in over 90 industry verticals, it serves as a hub to harness the diversity of talent, expertise and capabilities that reimagine growth for today’s progressive marketers.  \"We believe in collaboration and co-creation to give marketers a 'fit-for-purpose agency model where local knowledge fits with global scale to create unparalleled brand value,\" he added. The advertisement agency reached its 30 year milestone this year, marking three decades of groundbreaking work in brand and identity consultancy.  Born as a radically provocative creative hotshop at a time when global networks and large holding companies had their affiliates ruling the roost, D'Hamidi has since worked with over 400 brand and identity projects. Highlighting the achievements of the company, CCO Faraz said the most important achievement is the firm’s ability to stay true to its course, to never veer too far from its calling and provenance, and to consistently deliver on its DNA.  \"From the day we started, D’Hamidi’s mission was to ensure that our local brands look as good as, or better than, their international counterparts,\" said Faraz, adding that the company's contribution to Pakistan’s brand and visual culture has created a following of diehards, and a long list of local and international clients. Faraz said D'Hamidi's design-led thought leadership changed the way clients approached agencies, creating a much-needed distinction between service and servility.  The company, which has offices in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore, also expanded its services in Dubai to offer a roster of international clients.  Faraz, when asked if the company will see any expansion in the future, said populating a network for the sake of profitability will undermine this discipline.  \"It’s better to build your network around the talent that is available rather than the other way around. Moreover, the world is hyper-connected now. So getting work done remotely without the necessity of multiple studios is a huge opportunity,\" he explained.  Speaking about the use of technology and artificial intelligence in the brand and identity consultancy industry, Faraz said all developments to tech should be incorporated into the life of the brand.  \"A brand is a mirror that reflects the best of you right back at you. The trick, of course, is to ensure that developments in technology are under your control and in the service of your brand strategy. When that doesn’t happen, you can become slave to an algorithm and become blindly reactive, instead of thoughtfully responsive,\" Faraz told Geo.tv.  However, he cautioned the professionals about the technology, saying the \"only software worth using is the one between your ears\".  He added: \"Branding should simplify and clarify your positioning. And it fundamentally depends on the rare alchemy of the unusual combination of words and pictures. So a facility in either disciplines is the best 'technology' to work with.\" The CCO also spoke about how The D'Hamidi differs from other players in the brand consultancy industry, saying that his company is an independent firm.  \"We can show multiple degrees of speed, precision, insight and resilience that are not hammered under bureaucratic showmanship or delayed by hierarchies. D’Hamidi is a team of uniquely talented professionals who have been working together with telepathic fluency for an average of 20 years (or thereabouts).  \"This level of skill and chemistry is unprecedented and sets us leagues apart from career hunters or design upstarts whose methodology can be self-serving,\" he highlighted."

  "content": "QUETTA: An excavator operator, who saved a family stuck in severe flooding in Killa Abdullah, has been rewarded with cash prizes and announcement of scholarship for his son, Geo News reported on Saturday. Few days ago, Mohibullah saved five members of a family aboard a vehicle stuck in flash flood in Toba Achakzai neighbourhood. He single-handedly carried out the rescue operation putting his own life at a risk.  The Quetta corps commander awarded the excavator operator Rs0.5 million cash, while the Balochistan government announced to give his son scholarship under the Balochistan Education Programme. As people feared to help the family stuck in the flash flood, Mohibullah rode a bike to home and brought an excavator. In the video circulating on social media, he can be seen skillfully maneuvering the machine to bring the vehicle to dry land. People from across the country have widely appreciated this valiant act.  Meanwhile, Hilal-e-Ahmar Balochistan Chairman Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai and Awami National Party (ANP) member of the Balochistan Assembly Zamrak Khan Achakzai announced Rs0.2 million each for the rescuer. Achakzai also announced that he would hold an event in honour of Mohibullah upon his arrival in Quetta.  Killa Abdullah Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Farooq gave appreciation certificate and cash prize during an event at his office held to appreciate the excavator operator.  Talking to Geo News, Mohibullah said when he reached near the vehicle he heard children crying. He thought he would at least try to rescue the family if he could not pull the vehicle out of the flood. “Allah blessed me with an unseen help [to save the family],” he said. He said the vehicle’s owner wanted to give him all the money he had with him but he refused to take it as he did it for Allah. "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a key development in the political arena, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) have reached a consensus on cooperation in the National Assembly and the Senate, The News reported on Saturday. The inter-party progress came after Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan-led PTI delegation which also included Asad Qaisar, Shibli Faraz, Raoof Hasan and Akunzada Hussain Yousufzai met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence. Both the parties, who have traditionally been arch-rivals, have held multiple interactions since the February 8 polls owing to their mutual concerns regarding alleged election result manipulation and irregularities in the polls. Last month, PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser met the JUI-F chief, wherein the two sides formally agreed to hold talks at the committee level with regards to the prospects of cooperation on the political front. Sources told Geo News that the PTI also formed a five-member negotiation team for talks with Maulana's party with Chairman Gohar, Qaiser, Hasan, Faraz and NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub included in the panel. Meanwhile, the JUI-F's team comprised Kamran Murtaza Maulana Lutfur Rehman, Mufti Fazal Ghafoor, Aslam Ghauri and Maulana Amjad. In the same month, Fazl had also claimed that the Imran Khan-founded party had agreed to step down from the assemblies and dissolve the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) legislature to force the government into elections — however, the claim was categorically refuted by PTI Chairman Gohar. Speaking to the media after the meeting, PTI spokesperson Hasan said that it was a meeting between leadership of two parties adding that negotiating teams of two sides would continue to meet and move forward in the National Assembly and the Senate with mutual consultation. \"It was our first meeting at the committee level and we will continue to meet in future to enhance cooperation,\" he said. Meanwhile, JUI-F's Maulana Ziaur Rehman noted that the parties' committees will decide matters regarding legislative issues in the National Assembly and the Senate. Rehman further said that a two-member committee comprising Senators Shibli Faraz and Kamran Murtaza will deal with legislative matters in the upper house. The PTI and JUI-F's decision to cooperate comes against the backdrop of the former's \"resurrection\" in the assemblies following the Supreme Court's July 12 verdict where the apex court declared the party eligible for reserved seats. Although, ambiguity prevails regarding the PTI's parliamentary future owing to the Election (Amendment) Bill 2024, which provisions retrospective effect and addresses the issue of reserved seats that seemingly disfavours the Khan-founded party, the cooperation between the two opposition parties might irk Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government which has lost its two-thirds majority in the lower house since the SC verdict last month."

  "content": "QUETTA: Two children and a woman were killed while 14 others sustained injuries after a blast took place near police line in Pishin, Balochistan, police told Geo News on Saturday.  According to the law enforcers, the injured were shifted to a hospital with some of them in critical condition. Seven policemen were among those injured when the remote-controlled bomb, attached to a motorcycle, detonated, the city's senior superintendent of police, Manzoor Buledi, told Reuters. \"Explosives were planted in a motorcycle which was parked in the area,\" said police officer Mujeeb-Ur-Rehman.  Medical superintendent of Pishin Hospital, Dr Wakeel Sherani, said 13 wounded were moved to Quetta after receiving first aid while the bodies of the children and one of the injured are in the hospital.  One of the injured, who was shifted to the trauma center Quetta in critical condition, lost her life, said the hospital sources.  According to PTV News, the blast occurred near the Pishin's deputy commissioner's office.  President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the blast in Pishin resulting in the killing of innocent children. Expressing deep sorrow and grief, President Zardari extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue fight against terrorism, directing the relevant authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also offered his condolences and directed the authorities concerned to provide best possible medical treatment to the injured. He said those responsible for the incident should be identified and given exemplary punishment. Condemning the incident, spokesperson of the Balochistan government said that they regret the loss of precious human lives in terrorist incident.  Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the blast, saying that the anarchists want to destroy the peace of the province.  \"The morale of the security agencies cannot be undermined by cowardly acts. The scourge of terrorism will be eradicated with the help of security forces,\" he added.  Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in militant attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, since the banned outfit, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) put the truce with Islamabad to an end. KP and Balochistan — both bordering Afghanistan — were the epicenters of violence during the second quarter of 2024, accounting for nearly 92% of all fatalities and 87% of attacks (including incidents of terrorism and security forces operations).  Individually, the former suffered 67% and the latter 25% of all fatalities in Q2, 2024. "

The floods claimed over 1,700 lives and left millions, notably women and children, at risk of malnutrition-related fatalities. Taking to social media, the US Embassy of Pakistan shared a video in which Jonathan Lalley, the embassy spokesperson, said: \"Of the more than $215 million the United States provided for flood relief and recovery, nearly $100 million went toward addressing malnutrition.\" While sharing details of the embassy's efforts, Lalley revealed that the embassy, in a collaborative effort with the United Nation World Food Programme, provided \"emergency food and nutrition\" to the affected families. Additionally, he highlighted getting help from the Unicef to treat \"nearly 135,000 malnourished children,\" and provide \"pre-natal care to some 74,000 pregnant women.\" \"With the World Health Organisation (WHO), we established 12 nutrition stabilisation centers across Balochistan and Sindh to provide essential health services,\" he added. In the video, he also noted the recent delivery of an \"additional 486 tonnes of ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat an additional 39,000 children\" made by US Ambassador to Pakistan, Donald Blome. \"With that donation, the US has delivered emergency therapeutic food to more than 317,000 Pakistani mothers and children and enabled 779,000 frontline healthcare workers to provide nutrition counseling to parents and caregivers to help prevent malnutrition in the first place,\" Lalley said. Lalley ended the video by reiterating the US's promise to \"continue to work urgently with Pakistan to address the malnutrition crisis.\" \"Because every Pakistani child deserves the opportunity to grow up, to be healthy and strong, and to reach their full potential,\" he said before ending the video."

  "content": "KARACHI: An injured man from the Karsaz road accident, that claimed the lives of a father and daughter and wounded three other persons, is in critical condition at a hospital in the metropolis. Family members of the injured man, Abdul Salam, on Saturday, told Geo News that the next 48 hours were crucial for him as he had been put on a ventilator.  \"So far, we have not been contacted by any representative of the government. We have no one for help except for Allah,” a family member said, upon query. The family also said after being brought to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Abdus Salam remained in excruciating pain for more than eight hours and no one was there to look after him. Abdul Salam, a resident of Korangi No 1, was a book supplier and had \"gone for supplying books as usual when the incident took place,\" they said.  A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on August 19. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was in critical condition, said police. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman is a resident of KDA Scheme-I. She was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. The suspect was identified in the first information report (FIR) as \"Natasha\", who was sent to jail on judicial remand by a court in Karachi on August 21. As per the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on the phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the SUV driver hit his brother’s bike from the rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving license, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. They said that charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR."

  "content": "    The main culprit involved in a rocket attack that left 12 policemen dead in the riverine area of Rahim Yar Khan has been killed, the Punjab police said on Friday, pledging that all miscreants involved in the assault will be \"brought to justice\". The announcement from the police came a day after bandits launched the rocket launcher attack on policemen whose mobile van got stuck in rainwater in Machka area of the Punjab district, leaving dozen policemen dead and six others wounded. In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, the Punjab police said that the bandit Bashir Shar had been killed in the action while his accomplices including Sanaullah Shar, Gada Ali, Kamlu Shar, Ramzan Shar and Gadi were wounded. A day earlier, two police vehicles carrying around 22 policemen were attacked by bandits in Rahim Yar Khan after one of the vans broke down in low-level flooding. The gang used rocket launchers to target the stranded officers. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar expressed his resolve to bring all the bandits involved in the attack \"to their logical end\". \"The operation will continue until the perpetrators are eliminated,\" the police statement said. Responding to the development, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz lauded the police for prompt retaliation. “We will make a firm resolve to purge the Katcha area from the dacoits and the Punjab government cannot forget the precious sacrifices of the police martyrs.” “The terrorists involved in the martyrdom of police personnel will be taken to task,” she added. Earlier today, the funeral prayers for all the police martyrs were offered at the Sadiq Shaheed Police Lines Rahim Yar Khan. Those who attended the funeral include Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, IGP Anwar and Punjab Home Secretary Noor-ul-Amin Mengal, besides a large number of senior police and military officials, police personnel, public, and relatives of martyrs.  Meanwhile, the interior minister visited police personnel receiving treatment at Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Rahim Yar Khan.  Speaking to the media, he said the great sacrifices of martyrs would not go in vain. Expressing resolve to root out robbers from the Kachha area, he said that the federal government would provide complete support to the Punjab government in this regard. The minister also emphasised that those involved in the heinous act would be made an example, adding that the criminals would be awarded the harshest punishment under the law. The security czar also presided over a high-level meeting at the Rahim Yar Khan airport earlier today. He underscored the need for robust security measures and instructed authorities to equip operational forces with modern weapons and safety equipment. The minister directed all necessary measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Ordering a coordinated operation against the perpetrators, Naqvi stated that they would be dealt with “iron hands”."

  "content": " ISLAMABAD: As rifts emerged within PTI over abrupt postponement of August 22 rally, Barrister Aqeel Malik, the federal government's spokesperson on legal affairs, said that the Centre approached Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for cancellation of the public gathering. The former ruling party put off its public gathering in Islamabad and rescheduled it for September 8 as the local administration revoked the no-objection certificate (NOC) and sealed roads leading to the federal capital. PTI leaders Gohar Ali Khan and Azam Swati claimed that the gathering was postponed on instructions of party founder Imran Khan after they met the incarcerated politician at 07:00am in Adiala Jail ahead of the much-hyped public rally. However, several party leaders — including Imran's sister Aleema Khan — contradicted the top leaders statements.  Expressing a lack of confidence in the current PTI leadership, Aleema claimed that the PTI leaders have no \"real intention\" of freeing the former prime minister from jail. In a short audio clip, she also questioned why Swati paid a visit to Imran early in the morning and who instructed him to do so.  \"Considering the security concerns, the federal government formally reached out to KP chief minister [Gandapur] and requested him to postpone the rally,\" Barrister Aqeel said while speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan today. Later, the government's spokesperson said, Ali Amin Gandapur held a meeting the PTI leadership to review the security situation. \"The district administration revoked the notification after considering the situation\",\" he added.  In response to a question, Aqeel said that Imran Khan-founded party had been given conditional permission to hold public gathering on September 8.  Meanwhile, Adviser to KP chief minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif rejected Malik's statement and said the federal government did not contact CM Gandapur regarding the postponement of rally.  He said neither government nor any other institution facilitated PTI leaders' meeting with deposed prime minister. \"No discussion was held between Imran Khan and CM Gandapur in this regard.\" Barrister Saif also said the federal ministers cannot demoralise PTI workers with what he called \"concocted statements\". \"The decision to postpone the gathering was taken by Imran Khan in personal capacity,\" he asserted.  The district administration had revoked the NOC granted to PTI for August 22 rally on the \"report of district intelligence committee,\" according to an official statement. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Ali Randhawa.  Citing strict security concerns, the administration had noted that the Bangladesh cricket team was in Islamabad, adding that it is difficult to control the crowd of a rally."

  "content": "    The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Naib Emir Liaqat Baloch announced on Monday that the religio-political party would observe a shutter-down strike across the country on August 28 to mount pressure on the coalition government to provide relief to the masses. Baloch, while addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, said that trader community made a unanimous decision of observing a nationwide strike against inflation, high electricity prices and imposition of hefty taxes.  He warned that any attempt by the government to stop the strike would push the country into anarchy. The politico reminded that his party staged a 14-day protest in Rawalpindi and held negotiations with the federal government. The ministers had signed an agreement after accepting the JI's demands for providing relief to the inflation-hit nation earlier this month. He added that a one-month deadline was set to review the contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) in the agreement. The JI naib emir demanded the government to implement the agreement.  Baloch also hinted at starting a long march to Islamabad if needed. He added that his party had just postponed the sit-in after signing an agreement with the government, however, they would continue their struggle to get relief for the nation. Prior to giving a strike call, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman had announced another protest two weeks ago, saying that his party would give a call for peaceful protest by joining hands with trader groups. The protests' announcement came after the party postponed its 14-day long sit-in on August 9 following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with the IPPs which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers."

  "content": "  As speculations surrounding the appointment of a new chief justice run on, Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar has said that the principle of seniority will be followed in the appointment of a new top judge of the country. With the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa is set to retire in October this year, rumours of an \"extension\" in his tenure through judiciary-centric legislation in parliament have been rife. Rejecting the speculations, the law minister stated that the new CJP will be appointed based on \"seniority\" only. \"Seniority will be of paramount importance in the process of appointment of a new chief justice. The senior-most judge will be the chief justice,\" Tarar said while speaking to Geo News. Advising against politicising the appointment of judges, the minister said unnecessary debate should not held on the matter.  The principle of seniority in the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan is enshrined in Article 175-A(3) of the Constitution, and any ordinary legislation cannot bypass it. The legal experts say there is no constitutional mechanism for such an extension without amendments to the Constitution. It may be noted that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) gave rise to speculations by seeking an early issuance of notification regarding the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), earlier this month. CJP Isa, who is set to retire from the top judicial post on October 25, 2024, has \"no interest\" in getting an extension, as stated earlier by the law minister. Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah is next in line to become the country's top judge. The speculations about an extension gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 (Wednesday) to introduce key legislation.  However, speaking on Geo News show Capital Talk, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif announced that the joint session of the parliament was not going to take place on the said date. It would rather be held next week, he added. "

Screengrab via Geo NewsSmart kinetic approach being used against terrorists: CM Bugti.Hints at limiting 4G internet services to stop propaganda.Interior minister rules out talks with terrorists.<p...",
  "content": "QUETTA: After at least 38 people including law enforces lost their lives to different terrorist attacks in Balochistan in a single day, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Monday vowed stern action against the terrorists to avenge the killings \"without launching any grand operation\". \"At least 38 innocent people were martyred in the attack,\" said CM Bugti during a press conference in Quetta, adding that those involved in the killings are \"terrorists\" and not the Balochs. He was referring to the several terror incidents in Balochistan. In one of the attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News.   Providing details of the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai said armed men blocked the inter-provincial highway and offloaded passengers from the vehicles. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat, police told Geo News earlier today. Condemning the attacks, the chief minister pledged that the terrorists, their facilitators and sympathisers would be taken to task. He said that 21 terrorists have been killed by the security forces along with other law enforcement agencies in clearance operations across the province. He said that the state is standing with the victims, adding that all stakeholders including judiciary, media and civil society will also have to fight this war along with the state against terrorism. \"The state will establish its writ and take all necessary steps. We are ready for dialogue but with whom we should hold talks? Should we hold talks with those who killed innocent labourers?\" \"Innocent people were martyred after being offloaded from buses. Revenge will be taken from the terrorists. These activities were not carried out by disgruntled Balochs but terrorists who always search for soft targets.\" CM Bugti said that the provincial government will enhance the capacity of the forces and eliminate terrorism as a challenge. The government has a smart kinetic approach against terrorists who do not have a strong capacity in Balochistan, said the chief minister. He clarified that there is no need to launch a grand operation and the law and order situation would be brought under control via smart intelligence-based operations (IBOs). He also hinted at limiting 4G internet services in Balochistan following a surge in terrorist attacks and propaganda by anti-state elements against the state. He asked Baloch youth not to be part of terrorists' propaganda and invited them to share their grievances with the government if they had complaints about governance or jobs. Speaking about the terror incidents, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif condemned the Musakhel incident and blamed Baloch militant outfits for the killings. While talking to Geo News in the parliament, he said that there would be a mandatory reaction to the brutal killings of innocent people. The defence minister said that those people who staged sit-ins for missing persons should also protest against the \"massacre\" and show solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attack. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that terrorists could not be called disgruntled Balochs. \"We would try to appease the disgruntled people but there would be no talks with terrorists,\" he vowed. It is pertinent to mention here that security forces and law enforcement agencies eliminated 21 terrorists in separate operations on the night between August 25-26 in Balochistan, according to the Inter-Service Public Relations. On the behest of \"inimical and hostile forces\", the military's media wing said these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of Balochistan by targeting mainly innocent civilians, especially in Musa Khel, Kalat and Labela districts. It went on to say that security personnel immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists and ensured the security and protection of the local populace. However, during the conduct of operations, the statement said 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four LEAs personnel, having fought gallantly, made the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat."

  "content": "  Commander of the People’s Liberation Army Ground Forces General Li Qiaoming expressed admiration for Pakistan’s concerted efforts in combating terrorism and extremism during a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarter in Rawalpindi on Monday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. The Chinese commander also acknowledged the unwavering professionalism and dedication of the Pakistan army during the meeting. “The meeting afforded an opportunity for in-depth discussions on matters of mutual interest, regional security, military training, and measures to further augment bilateral defence cooperation,” the military’s media wing said. Moreover, the army chief underscored the robust relations between the Pakistan Army and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting the ongoing bilateral military cooperation is a testament to the enduring brotherhood between the two nations, as per the ISPR. The ISPR said: “COAS General Syed Asim Munir expressed his gratitude to the dignitary, reiterating that Pakistan deeply cherishes its fraternal ties with China.” Earlier, upon arrival at the GHQ, General Li paid respects at the Yadgar-e-Shuhada by laying a floral wreath, and was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army, in a ceremonial display of respect and hospitality, according to the statement. General Li also called on Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif. PM Shehbaz warmly welcomed General Li to Pakistan and underscored that Pakistan and China are All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners and trusted friends. The prime minister highlighted that the deep-rooted ties between the two nations enjoy broad public, political, and institutional support in Pakistan, making them indispensable for the progress and development of both countries. He expressed satisfaction at the deepening military-to-military exchanges, noting that the defence and strategic ties between Pakistan and China are vital for peace and stability in the region. These relations form the foundation of their bilateral relationship. General Li, in his remarks, affirmed China as an iron brother, strategic partner, and reliable friend, placing the highest priority on its relationship with Pakistan. He also expressed China’s desire to elevate their bilateral friendship to new levels of cooperation and collaboration.  Recognising the role of Pakistan’s armed forces in promoting regional peace and stability and combating terrorism, the Chinese commander reiterated the PLA’s commitment to further expanding its cooperation with Pakistan in order to enhance the capacity building of the two armed forces. The two sides focused on various aspects of the Pakistan-China friendship, particularly the bilateral defence and strategic partnership. Notably, both Pakistan and China enjoy fraternal bilateral and diplomatic relations  established on May 21, 1951.  In July this year, officials from both the countries vowed to accelerate the progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a cornerstone of bilateral relations. A pledge to this effect was renewed during a productive meeting between Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Prof Ahsan Iqbal, and Zhao Chenxin, the vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, at the NDRC headquarters in Beijing. Additionally, in the same month, General Munir, while revitalising bilateral ties between Pakistan and China, said that they \"are exceptional and have always weathered the vicissitudes of the strategic environment with mutual trust and unwavering belief in each other's support\". The army chief made the remarks on the occasion of the 97th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China hosted at the GHQ in Rawalpindi, according to ISPR. Economically, China is Pakistan’s largest trading partner and a major investor, especially in infrastructure and energy sector. — With additional input from APP"

PID/File<p class=\"medium-insert-active\"> PTI not expecting any concession after deferring Islamabad rally: Swati.Says they only wanted implementation of law, Constitution in country.Barrister Gohar Ali Khan alleges govt \"secretly...",
  "content": "    Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Azam Swati said on Monday that whoever facilitated his meeting with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan had made a \"positive move\" for the country. \"It was a positive move to protect the system of Pakistan,\" said Swati outside the Supreme Court while pointing towards his meeting with the former prime minister at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi earlier this week before the former ruling party rescheduled his Islamabad power show from August 22 to September 8. He went on to say that his party was not expecting any kind of concession [from the government] after postponing its Islamabad rally. Swati added that the PTI only wanted the implementation of the law and the Constitution in the country. The Imran-founded party made all-out efforts to stage a huge power show in the federal capital apparently to revive its diminishing political strength, however, it went in vain after the city administration denied permission citing security reasons. The postponement decision was taken after Swati held a meeting with the PTI founder in the Rawalpindi Central Jail on the day of the Islamabad rally in which the latter gave permission to the party leadership to defer the jalsa. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also confirmed the development on Thursday. However, in a recent audio statement, Aleema Khan, sister of the ousted premier who was removed from office in April 2022, resented the move, criticising the PTI leadership for not having any \"real intention\" of getting the party founder out of jail. In a short audio clip, purportedly featuring the voice of Aleema, questions were raised about why Swati visited Imran early in the morning and at whose behest. “Who instructed him [Swati] to meet Imran at 7 am and deliver a message regarding the rally’s postponement?” Welcoming PTI's decision, the federal government's spokesperson on legal affairs, Barrister Aqeel Malik, claimed that the Centre approached Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for the cancellation of the public gathering. He also confirmed that the party had been given conditional permission for a rally on September 8. In yet another blow, the party also shelved its power show in Lahore scheduled for August 27 \"to focus on the forthcoming Islamabad rally” without giving a new date, according to the former ruling party's Secretary of Information for Punjab, Shaukat Mahmood Basra. The development is being dubbed another dent in the political reputation of the embattled party, which has suffered back-to-back setbacks in holding its political events. Barrister Gohar slammed the coalition government led by the PML-N for “secretly working on legislation” instead of holding parliamentary party meetings before every session of parliament. \"This is not the way to do legislation secretly around the world,\" said the PTI chairman while talking to journalists in Islamabad today, adding that his party's lawmakers would review all aspects of the government's legislation in the parliamentary party meeting. Gohar also said that his party \"would oppose any kind of extension\". His statement pointed towards the rumoured legislation of the incumbent government to grant an extension to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa despite denial from some ministers. The speculations gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 to introduce key legislation, including changes in the laws related to the top jurist's appointments based on the principle of seniority. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar clarified two days ago that the federal government was not considering any option to extend judges' tenure \"for now\", rebutting speculations that the federal government was planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in parliament. When questioned about the constitutional amendments in the pipeline on Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar had categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. He further clarified that no constitutional amendment could be introduced during a joint session of the parliament. The federal minister had said that the speculations were fictitious as President Asif Ali Zardari summoned a routine session of parliament. He, however, had confirmed that there was a chance for a joint session next week in which the legislators would take up some pending bills. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, had also said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now. It is worth mentioning that prior to the expected joint parliament session, President Zardari also summoned the session of the National Assembly on August 26 (today) and the Senate on August 27 (tomorrow) under Article 54(1) of the Constitution."

  "content": "KARACHI: Heavy rains are anticipated in the metropolis port city of Karachi from August 27 till 31st, Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz informed Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah during a meeting on rain emergency measures. In the meeting chaired by the chief minister, Sarfaraz said that the port city is expected to experience a rainfall between 150mm to 200mm under the new spell, as per an official statement issued by the Sindh CM House. The Met chief also mentioned that wind thunderstorms are also expected with scattered heavy to isolated and very heavy falls during this time. Notably, urban flooding as a result of torrential downpours is also anticipated along with rain inundation in Karachi and other metropolitan cities of Sindh. Moreover, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has reported that a well-marked low-pressure area over central India has intensified into a depression over Madhya Pradesh and is expected to move west-southwestward, possibly reaching eastern Sindh on the night of August 26th. As a consequence, this weather system is likely to bring strong monsoon currents into Sindh. The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, Sharjeel Memon, Saeed Ghani, Jam Khan Shoro, Makhdoom Mahboob, Adviser Najmi Alam, Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab, Mayor Sukkur Arslan Shaikh, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, SMBR Baqaullah Unar, and Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi.

Thatta, Sujawal, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazirabad are likely to experience rainfall between 250mm to 300mm, whereas, Badin, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tharparkar, Umerkot will probably see a rainfall of 500mm as the rest of the districts are likely to experience rain showers between 70mm to 100mm. Additionally, in light of these notable rain forecasts, CM Murad alerted all local bodies, district administration, and the irrigation department to be prepared for timely action in case of any emergency. He also instructed the Fisheries Department to provide the fishermen with the necessary advice so that they can take the required precautions during this forecasted period."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Weeks after the Supreme Court announced its short order in the reserved seats case, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Monday pleaded with the top court to get its July 12 ruling implemented after the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) raised multiple objections in executing the short order.  The party of incarcerated Imran Khan has filed a civil miscellaneous application through its counsel Uzair Bhandari advocate, in response to the ECP's plea requesting the court to provide guidance on certain legal and factual issues of the order. The election regulator on August 7 filed a review petition in the top court against the short verdict involving the PTI and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).   In its petition, the ECP maintained that 80 independent candidates had decided to join the SIC and submitted relevant documents to declare their allegiance to the party. However, it added that the SIC did not participate in the February 8 nationwide polls as a political party nor submitted any list of candidates for the reserved seats. The apex court, in its much anticipated July 12 verdict, ruled that the former ruling party is allowed to have seats reserved for women and minorities in all legislatures including the National Assembly — a decision that will potentially turn the PTI into the largest party in the lower house of the parliament.  Today, the PTI’s plea seeks the apex court to dismiss the Election Commission’s review petition asking for SC’s clarification in connection with the execution of the July 12 short order. The PTI’s plea also mentioned the electoral body’s objection, saying the ECP has averred wrongly that “the commission is facing difficulty to implement the order ibid as PTI at the moment has no organizational structure for confirmation of statements of MNAs/MPAs”. The Imran-led party also requested the court to issue directives to the election-conducting body to accept the affidavits of allegiance filed by the independent lawmakers, signed by Barrister Gohar Khan and Omar Ayub, the elected chairman and General Secretary of PTI, respectively.  The party also requested the court to direct the ECP to implement the July 12 short order. The PTI said that the Election Commission has filed the application with mala fide intentions, saying that the election regulatory body seeks to “circumvent and delay the implementation of the short order” as it aims to deny the party its “rightful share of the reserved seats”. Responding to the EC’s objection regarding the PTI’s organisational structure, the plea stated that the party’s organisation structure is well in place as the “PTI has taken all necessary steps and is in full compliance with the applicable law”. Responding to another objection, the plea further said the party conducted its intra-party elections on March 3, 2024 when Barrister Gohar Khan was elected unopposed as chairman of the party and Omar Ayub Khan also was elected unopposed as General Secretary.  Later, the party submitted details of its intra-party election to the ECP on March 4, 2024, the plea said, adding the election body has since written a number of letters to PTI with some of the letters addressed to Barrister Gohar Khan, referring to him as the \"Chairman of PTI\".

  "content": "    As many as 14 security personnel were martyred in clearance operations against terrorists in Balochistan, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Monday. The military's media wing said on the night between August 25-26, the terrorists attempted to conduct numerous heinous activities in Balochistan. On behest of “inimical and hostile forces”, the ISPR said these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of Balochistan by targeting mainly the innocent civilians, especially in Musa Khel, Kalat and Labela districts.  Resultantly, numerous innocent civilians embraced shahadat. In Musa Khel district, terrorists stopped a bus in Rara Sham area and maliciously targeted innocent citizens, working in Balochistan to earn their livelihood, the ISPR said. It went on to say that security forces and law enforcement agencies immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists and \"sent 21 terrorists to hell in ensuing clearance operations, ensuring security and protection of local populace\". However, during the conduct of operations, the statement said 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies, having fought gallantly, made the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat. Sanitisation operations are being conducted and the instigators, perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these heinous and cowardly acts, targeting innocent civilians, will be brought to justice, the statement added. \"Security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,\" the military's media wing said. The clearance operations were launched as at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorists incidents in Balochistan. In one of the attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News on Monday. Providing details of the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai said armed men blocked the inter-provincial highway and offloaded passengers from the vehicles. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat, police told Geo News earlier today. Kalat Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dostin Dashti said those martyred in the incident included a police sub-inspector, four Levies personnel and five citizens. Militants also blew up a railway bridge in nearby Bolan district on a track that connects the province to Punjab and Sindh, with six dead bodies found nearby, said Javed Baloch, a senior government official in the district. Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest province, despite an abundance of untapped natural resources, and lags behind the rest of the country in education, employment and economic development. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed \"deep grief and condemnation over the terrorist attack\" in a statement issued Monday by his office. — With additional input from AFP"

  "content": "   LAHORE: A local court in the Punjab capital on Monday discharged suspect Farhan Asif from the charges of spreading disinformation regarding the killer of three children in Southport, England — the gruesome murders that recently sparked widespread riots in the United Kingdom.  The Lahore police had arrested the suspect on the charges of publishing \"fake news\" story that allegedly triggered widespread anti-immigrant riots in the UK.  The riots saw numerous mosques, asylum centres and immigrant homes being attacked in several regions of Britain. In Pakistan, Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime wing was investigating the charges against Asif.  During the hearing today, the investigation officer (IO) informed a judicial magistrate's court in Lahore that the \"news\" about the murder had been shared on the social media previously and suspect Asif had only \"re-shared\" it.  \"The allegations have been investigated from every aspect and no evidence against the suspect has been found,\" the IO stated.  At this, the court inquired about the time and person with whom the suspect shared the news.  Asif, while responding to the query, stated that he deleted the news six hours after sharing it.  After this, the court discharged the suspect and ordered his immediate release.  Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were the three girls who were killed in the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town of Southport on July 29. The assault also left eight children and two adults wounded. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested. However, due to his age, his identity was not disclosed. But, misinformation about the suspect's Muslim identity began circulating online. Social media reports named him Ali-Al-Shakati, claiming he migrated to the UK by boat in 2023. These social media claims that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant triggered anti-immigrant riots across the UK."

  "content": "NORTH WAZIRISTAN: Four people were killed after a blast rocked a bazaar in the Razmak town of North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, district administration told Geo News on Monday.  According to the administration, the blast occurred in the Razmak Bazaar which also injured more than 10 people who have been transferred to a hospital.  The blast comes at a time when Pakistan, particularly its KP and Balochistan provinces, are witnessing a surge in terror activities for the past few months. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the incident in Razmak, offering his condolences to the families of those who died in the attack.  Expressing his determination to continue efforts for the complete elimination of terrorism from the country, the president prayed for the departed souls.  Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi also condemned the blast and offered his condolences to the families of those who died in the incident. \"The entire nation is determined to end terrorism,\" said Governor Kundi. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — KP and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

They said the security operation would continue until the terrorists were eliminated. In a separate terrorist attack, a railway bridge was blown up in Bolan’s Dozan area, said police. Following which, they said, local administration and railway authorities reached the incident’s site. Pakistan Railways said the railway service between Punjab and Sindh was suspended after destruction of the bridge.  Railway authorities said track in Mastung and Sheikh Wasil areas were also destroyed through explosions, following which the goods train from Quetta to Taftan was also cancelled. On the other hand, Bolan Mail and Jaffer Express could not leave from Quetta for Karachi and Rawalpindi, respectively, as train operation was suspended after the railway bridge explosion, they said.  Moreover, trains coming to Quetta from Sindh and Punjab were also stopped at different points, the authorities said. Bolan Mail coming from Karachi was stopped at Larkana station and a train coming from Rawalpindi was stopped in Sukkur, they added. In view of the multiple terrorist attacks, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind said Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had convened an important huddle.  He said the terrorists struck two to three sites during the last night, including the incident wherein some passengers were identified and dislodged from vehicles.  “It will take some time to repair the affected railway bridge,” he said, raising suspicion that the bridge was apparently blown up with the help of an explosive device. On the other hand, a group of armed men set several vehicles and record on fire at a Levies station in Mastung, Levies sources told Geo News. Levies maintained that no personnel was harmed in the attack. They added that the armed persons had seized the station and it was vacated through operation of security forces. No suspect could be held as they managed to escape from the building.  However, a dead body of an unidentified person was found near the station, said Levies. Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said four bodies of unidentified persons were found in Kolpur area of Bolan.  “They were killed by gunfire and their bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital,” said the authority, adding that the identification process of the bodies was being carried out. In his remarks on the law and order situation unfolding in Balochistan, Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi said the facts would be brought forward with evidence on the terrorist incidents after an investigation. “The incidents of terror are a conspiracy to create instability in Pakistan. The enemy wants to create anarchy in the country under a well thought out plan,” he said, confirming that the security forces and law enforcers took timely action and neutralised 12 terrorists. He said every possible step would be taken to establish peace in the province marred by violence.  “Terrorists and their facilitators will not find a place to hide,” he said, adding that he was in touch with the Balochistan government. Additionally, Naqvi said, he shared the grief of the martyrs’ families.  He said the war would continue until the complete eradication of terrorism. The law and order situation in Balochistan was being monitored on a regular basis, he maintained."

  "content": "QUETTA: At least 23 passengers travelling to their destinations were killed after being offloaded from buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News on Monday. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai provided details of the incident, stating that armed men had blocked the inter-provincial highway to carry out the massacre.  Police and Levies forces quickly reached the site to repel the attack, while rescuers transported the deceased and injured to the hospital, he added. Speaking on Geo News programme \"Geo Pakistan,\" Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind revealed that militants launched a coordinated assault on multiple (two to three) fronts but were met with fierce resistance from security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs). However, he added that the terrorists used the cover of darkness to carry out the Musakhel attack, during which they dragged the passengers down from the buses and shot them after identity check. Underscoring the provincial government's resolve to tackle the law and order situation, Rind said that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had called a meeting where \"important decisions\" would be made. “To find a way out of this situation, a holistic approach is required from the political government and security forces, with support from all schools of thought,” he said. The Musakhel incident highlights the ongoing security challenges Balochistan faces. Pakistan has witnessed a spike in terrorism-related incidents since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror activities are reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Owing to the security situation, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism. Condemning the heinous incident, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of precious human lives and termed the perpetrators as “enemies of the nation”. The president also said the terrorists responsible for the brutal killings must be brought to justice. Expressing anger and sorrow over the Musakhel killings, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the local administration to cooperate with the bereaved families and provide immediate medical assistance to the injured. \"The terrorists responsible for the Musakhel incident will be punished. The war against terrorists will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism from the country,\" PM Shehbaz said. Issuing a strong condemnation of the incident, CM Balochistan Bugti vowed to bring the terrorists and their facilitators to the dock."

  "content": "In Dallas, the Pakistan American Patriot Association (PAPA) organised a lively Independence Day festival to mark the country's independence with great enthusiasm. A large number of Pakistani Americans from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and surrounding cities attended the event with their families. The festival featured outstanding performances by renowned Pakistani singers Ali Haider, Shehzad Roy, Hadi Uppal, and Malaika Faisal, who captivated the audience with their songs. Stalls of traditional Pakistani food, clothes, jewellery and various public services were set up by the organisers, which attracted significant attention from the attendees. The festival also featured a special stall by the Dallas chapter of the American Pakistani Public Affairs Committee (APPAC), led by Imtiaz Rahi. The festival was a sea of green, with women, children, and people of all ages waving Pakistani flags, dancing to patriotic songs, and expressing their deep love for their homeland. Many attendees expressed that they keep Pakistan close to their hearts even while living in the US, and they pray for the country's prosperity, saying: \"our hearts are Pakistani.\" PAPA's President Inamullah Sherwani stated that they have been organising the Independence Day festival for several years. He remarked that the hall was filled to capacity, a testament to the event's success. The audience not only enjoyed the musical performances but also indulged in shopping and savoured the taste of traditional Pakistani cuisine. Sherwani extended his heartfelt gratitude to his entire team, the volunteers, and all the sponsors who made this grand event possible.

  "content": " LAHORE: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Sunday agreed to consult the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in advance on 'significant policies' amid efforts to defuse tensions with the ruling ally. The coordination committee of the PML-N and the PPP held a meeting at the Punjab Governor's House in Lahore to discuss issues related to the implementation of their power-sharing agreement — struck by the two parties after the February 8 general elections. Ishaq Dar and Raja Pervez Ashraf co-chaired the meeting, which was also attended by Malik Ahmed Khan, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Rana Sanaullah Hassan Murtaza, and Ali Haider Gilani. Sources told Geo News that the meeting agreed to implement the remaining points of the power-sharing agreement in a phased manner. According to sources, the PML-N agreed to consult PPP in advance on legislation, budget and policies. Both parties also vowed to work together for the country's stability.    It was also agreed that the PPP lawmakers in Punjab would get development funds equivalent to PML-N ones. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Hassan said that talks with the ally were held in a pleasant atmosphere. \"Both the parties want to take coalition government forward.\" The politician asserted that a sub-committee has been constituted to look into power-sharing issues. \"It will finalise the matters and bring them before the coordination committee,\" he added. Rejecting the notion that the PPP was seeking a share in the Punjab government, he said his party would never give \"tough time\" [to its ally] to achieve its goals. Moreover, Hassan said the meeting also discussed matters regarding inflation and law and order in the province. \"We favour long-term relief instead of short-term,\" he said, apparently referring to the Punjab government's power subsidy worth Rs45 billion. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government announced a reduction of Rs14 per unit in the electricity tariff for August and September under a power subsidy plan for consumers using 201 to 500 units. The decision drew criticism from the party's political archrival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the major ruling allies Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the PPP, as the latter termed the power subsidy a short-term relief and a decision taken merely for optics. On the other side, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah echoed Hassan's remarks regarding a share in the provincial government. He said both parties agreed on meeting every fortnight to discuss the matters. The meeting came three days after leaders of the two parties including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari sat together in Islamabad to iron out differences. Sources said that the coalition government led by PM Shehbaz took the PPP leadership into confidence ahead of \"crucial legislation\" in the National Assembly. It is pertinent to mention here that the two political allies have been at odds for quite some time over the issue of the federal budget, and power subsidy among others. After the February 8 general elections, the PPP formed a government in Sindh and announced its support for PML-N in the formation of the government in Centre and Punjab but refused to accept the ministries."

According to the police, the body of the 12-year-old victim was found  stashed in a gunny bag from the garbage dump near Lukcy Star.

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed that the financial package for Public Works Department (PWD) employees, who will be laid off due to the institution's dissolution, will not apply to those proven guilty of serious corruption charges. The prime minister chaired a meeting on Sunday to review the legal aspects and final procedures concerning the disbanding of the PWD. PM Shehbaz also tasked the officials with preparing the final plan for transferring ongoing PWD projects to provinces and relevant departments, while instructing that all final recommendations on the matter of closure be submitted to the cabinet at the earliest. Furthermore, the premier also ordered the implementation of the age relaxation proposal to re-employ hardworking and honest staffers who have had a short period of employment with the PWD. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Economic Affairs Division Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Housing and Works Minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada, and high-ranking officials from the relevant departments. In a separate meeting, PM Shehbaz assigned the relevant departments the undertaking of implementing the e-office system in all government offices. Giving a month's deadline, the prime minister warned the officials of Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication that any delay in the execution of the plan would not be tolerated. \"There should be no file work without e-office in the government offices from next month,\" he said, adding that implementing the plan would enhance transparency in the system, which was the government's top priority. On the prime minister's direction, the PM Office staff has already completed their e-office training. Last week, PM Shehbaz also started receiving files through the new system. Highlighting that the e-office is a crucial step towards enhancing governance and promoting digitisation in the country, the PM sought a report on the progress of its implementation within the next two weeks."

  "content": "After calling off a two-week-long sit-in against inflated power tariffs and agreements with IPPs earlier this month, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) on Monday announced to observe a nationwide shutter-down strike to push the federal government to announce relief measures for the masses.  Baloch, while addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, said that trader community made a unanimous decision of observing a nationwide strike against inflation, high electricity prices and imposition of hefty taxes. He warned that any attempt by the government to stop the strike would push the country into anarchy. The politico reminded that his party staged a 14-day protest in Rawalpindi and held negotiations with the federal government. The ministers had signed an agreement after accepting the JI's demands for providing relief to the inflation-hit nation earlier this month. He added that a one-month deadline was set to review the contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) in the agreement. The JI naib emir demanded the government to implement the agreement. Baloch also hinted at starting a long march to Islamabad if needed. He added that his party had just postponed the sit-in after signing an agreement with the government, however, they would continue their struggle to get relief for the nation. Prior to giving a strike call, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman had announced another protest two weeks ago, saying that his party would give a call for peaceful protest by joining hands with trader groups. The protests' announcement came after the party postponed its 14-day long sit-in on August 9 following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with the IPPs which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers."

  "content": "Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar has clarified that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) is \"seniority\".  Speculations have been rife regarding a judiciary-centric legislation in parliament for granting extension to the top judge who is set to retire in October this year. Rejecting these speculations, the law minister stated that the new CJP will be appointed based on \"seniority\" only. \"Seniority will be of paramount importance in the process of appointment of a new chief justice. The senior-most judge will be the chief justice,\" Tarar said while speaking to Geo News on Monday. Advising against politicising the appointment of judges, the minister said unnecessary debate should not be held on the matter. The principle of seniority in the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan is enshrined in Article 175-A(3) of the Constitution, and any ordinary legislation cannot bypass it. The legal experts say there is no constitutional mechanism for such an extension without amendments to the Constitution. It may be noted that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) gave rise to speculations by seeking an early issuance of notification regarding the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), earlier this month. CJP Isa, who is set to retire from the top judicial post on October 25, 2024, has \"no interest\" in getting an extension, as stated earlier by the law minister. Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah is next in line to become the country's top judge. The speculations about an extension gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 (Wednesday) to introduce key legislation. However, speaking on Geo News show Capital Talk, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif announced that the joint session of the parliament was not going to take place on the said date. It would rather be held next week, he added. "

  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Monday that terrorists will be taken to task via intelligence-based operations (IBOs) \"without conducting any grand operation\" after at least 37 people including security personnel were martyred in separate terrorist attacks in a single day in the province. \"At least 38 innocent people were martyred in the attack,\" said CM Bugti during a press conference in Quetta, adding that those involved in the killings are \"terrorists\" and not the Balochs. He was referring to the several terror incidents in Balochistan. In one of the attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News. Providing details of the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai said armed men blocked the inter-provincial highway and offloaded passengers from the vehicles. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat, police told Geo News earlier today. Condemning the attacks, the chief minister pledged that the terrorists, their facilitators and sympathisers would be taken to task. He said that 21 terrorists have been killed by the security forces along with other law enforcement agencies in clearance operations across the province. He said that the state is standing with the victims, adding that all stakeholders including judiciary, media and civil society will also have to fight this war along with the state against terrorism. \"The state will establish its writ and take all necessary steps. We are ready for dialogue but with whom we should hold talks? Should we hold talks with those who killed innocent labourers?\" \"Innocent people were martyred after being offloaded from buses. Revenge will be taken from the terrorists. These activities were not carried out by disgruntled Balochs but terrorists who always search for soft targets.\" CM Bugti said that the provincial government will enhance the capacity of the forces and eliminate terrorism as a challenge. The government has a smart kinetic approach against terrorists who do not have a strong capacity in Balochistan, said the chief minister. He clarified that there is no need to launch a grand operation and the law and order situation would be brought under control via smart intelligence-based operations (IBOs). He also hinted at limiting 4G internet services in Balochistan following a surge in terrorist attacks and propaganda by anti-state elements against the state. He asked Baloch youth not to be part of terrorists' propaganda and invited them to share their grievances with the government if they had complaints about governance or jobs. Speaking about the terror incidents, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif condemned the Musakhel incident and blamed Baloch militant outfits for the killings. While talking to Geo News in the parliament, he said that there would be a mandatory reaction to the brutal killings of innocent people. The defence minister said that those people who staged sit-ins for missing persons should also protest against the \"massacre\" and show solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attack. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that terrorists could not be called disgruntled Balochs. \"We would try to appease the disgruntled people but there would be no talks with terrorists,\" he vowed. It is pertinent to mention here that security forces and law enforcement agencies eliminated 21 terrorists in separate operations on the night between August 25-26 in Balochistan, according to the Inter-Service Public Relations. On the behest of \"inimical and hostile forces\", the military's media wing said these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of Balochistan by targeting mainly innocent civilians, especially in Musa Khel, Kalat and Labela districts. It went on to say that security personnel immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists and ensured the security and protection of the local populace. However, during the conduct of operations, the statement said 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four LEAs personnel, having fought gallantly, made the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat."

  "content": "Commander of the People’s Liberation Army Ground Forces General Li Qiaoming expressed admiration for Pakistan’s concerted efforts in combating terrorism and extremism in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarter in Rawalpindi, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Monday. China's commander also acknowledged the unwavering professionalism and dedication of the Pakistan army during the meeting. “The meeting afforded an opportunity for in-depth discussions on matters of mutual interest, regional security, military training, and measures to further augment bilateral defence cooperation,” the military’s media wing said. Moreover, the army chief underscored the robust relations between the Pakistan Army and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting the ongoing bilateral military cooperation is a testament to the enduring brotherhood between the two nations, as per the ISPR. The ISPR said: “COAS General Syed Asim Munir expressed his gratitude to the dignitary, reiterating that Pakistan deeply cherishes its fraternal ties with China.” Earlier, upon arrival at the GHQ, General Li paid respects at the Yadgar-e-Shuhada by laying a floral wreath, and was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army, in a ceremonial display of respect and hospitality, according to the statement. Separately, General Li also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. PM Shehbaz warmly welcomed General Li to Pakistan and underscored that Pakistan and China are All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners and trusted friends. The prime minister highlighted that the deep-rooted ties between the two nations enjoy broad public, political, and institutional support in Pakistan, making them indispensable for the progress and development of both countries. He expressed satisfaction at the deepening military-to-military exchanges, noting that the defence and strategic ties between Pakistan and China are vital for peace and stability in the region. These relations form the foundation of their bilateral relationship. General Li, in his remarks, affirmed China as an iron brother, strategic partner, and reliable friend, placing the highest priority on its relationship with Pakistan. He also expressed China’s desire to elevate their bilateral friendship to new levels of cooperation and collaboration.  Recognising the role of Pakistan’s armed forces in promoting regional peace and stability and combating terrorism, the Chinese commander reiterated the PLA’s commitment to further expanding its cooperation with Pakistan in order to enhance the capacity building of the two armed forces. The two sides focused on various aspects of the Pakistan-China friendship, particularly the bilateral defence and strategic partnership. Notably, both Pakistan and China enjoy fraternal bilateral and diplomatic relations established on May 21, 1951.  In July this year, officials from both the countries vowed to accelerate the progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a cornerstone of bilateral relations. A pledge to this effect was renewed during a productive meeting between Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Prof Ahsan Iqbal, and Zhao Chenxin, the vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, at the NDRC headquarters in Beijing. Additionally, in the same month, General Munir, while revitalising bilateral ties between Pakistan and China, said that they \"are exceptional and have always weathered the vicissitudes of the strategic environment with mutual trust and unwavering belief in each other's support\". The army chief made the remarks on the occasion of the 97th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China hosted at the GHQ in Rawalpindi, according to ISPR. Economically, China is Pakistan’s largest trading partner and a major investor, especially in infrastructure and energy sector.  — With additional input from APP"

  "content": "KARACHI: Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz informed Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah that heavy rains are anticipated in the metropolis port city of Karachi from August 27 till 31st during a meeting on rain emergency measures. In the meeting chaired by the chief minister on Monday, the weatherman said that under the new spell, the port city is expected to experience a rainfall between 150mm to 200mm, as per an official statement issued by the Sindh CM House. The Met chief also mentioned that wind thunderstorms are also expected with scattered heavy to isolated and very heavy falls during this time. Notably, urban flooding as a result of torrential downpours is also anticipated along with rain inundation in Karachi and other metropolitan cities of Sindh. Moreover, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has reported that a well-marked low-pressure area over central India has intensified into a depression over Madhya Pradesh and is expected to move west-southwestward, possibly reaching eastern Sindh on the night of August 26th. As a consequence, this weather system is likely to bring strong monsoon currents into Sindh. The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, Sharjeel Memon, Saeed Ghani, Jam Khan Shoro, Makhdoom Mahboob, Adviser Najmi Alam, Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab, Mayor Sukkur Arslan Shaikh, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, SMBR Baqaullah Unar, and Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi. The CM was also informed by the Met chief that districts including Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu, Kambar Shahdadkot, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, and Larkana may also experience rain, wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy to very heavy and isolated hefty falls from August 26 (tonight) until August 31st, with occasional gaps. Thatta, Sujawal, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazirabad are likely to experience rainfall between 250mm to 300mm, whereas, Badin, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tharparkar, Umerkot will probably see a rainfall of 500mm as the rest of the districts are likely to experience rain showers between 70mm to 100mm. Additionally, in light of these notable rain forecasts, CM Murad alerted all local bodies, district administration, and the irrigation department to be prepared for timely action in case of any emergency. He also instructed the Fisheries Department to provide the fishermen with the necessary advice so that they can take the required precautions during this forecasted period."

  "content": "After the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) postponed its power show in Islamabad following the incarcerated party founder's directives, senior leader Azam Swati said on Monday that whoever facilitated his meeting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail had made a \"positive move\". \"It was a positive move to protect the system of Pakistan,\" said Swati outside the Supreme Court while pointing towards his meeting with the former prime minister at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi earlier this week before the former ruling party rescheduled his Islamabad power show from August 22 to September 8. He went on to say that his party was not expecting any kind of concession [from the government] after postponing its Islamabad rally. Swati added that the PTI only wanted the implementation of the law and the Constitution in the country. The Imran-founded party made all-out efforts to stage a huge power show in the federal capital apparently to revive its diminishing political strength, however, it went in vain after the city administration denied permission citing security reasons. The postponement decision was taken after Swati held a meeting with the PTI founder in the Rawalpindi Central Jail on the day of the Islamabad rally in which the latter gave permission to the party leadership to defer the jalsa. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also confirmed the development on Thursday. However, in a recent audio statement, Aleema Khan, sister of the ousted premier who was removed from office in April 2022, resented the move, criticising the PTI leadership for not having any \"real intention\" of getting the party founder out of jail. In a short audio clip, purportedly featuring the voice of Aleema, questions were raised about why Swati visited Imran early in the morning and at whose behest. “Who instructed him [Swati] to meet Imran at 7 am and deliver a message regarding the rally’s postponement?” Welcoming PTI's decision, the federal government's spokesperson on legal affairs, Barrister Aqeel Malik, claimed that the Centre approached Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for the cancellation of the public gathering. He also confirmed that the party had been given conditional permission for a rally on September 8. In yet another blow, the party also shelved its power show in Lahore scheduled for August 27 \"to focus on the forthcoming Islamabad rally” without giving a new date, according to the former ruling party's Secretary of Information for Punjab, Shaukat Mahmood Basra. The development is being dubbed another dent in the political reputation of the embattled party, which has suffered back-to-back setbacks in holding its political events. Barrister Gohar slammed the coalition government led by the PML-N for “secretly working on legislation” instead of holding parliamentary party meetings before every session of parliament. \"This is not the way to do legislation secretly around the world,\" said the PTI chairman while talking to journalists in Islamabad today, adding that his party's lawmakers would review all aspects of the government's legislation in the parliamentary party meeting. Gohar also said that his party \"would oppose any kind of extension\". His statement pointed towards the rumoured legislation of the incumbent government to grant an extension to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa despite denial from some ministers. The speculations gained attraction after it emerged that the federal government is reportedly planning to summon a joint session on August 28 to introduce key legislation, including changes in the laws related to the top jurist's appointments based on the principle of seniority. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar clarified two days ago that the federal government was not considering any option to extend judges' tenure \"for now\", rebutting speculations that the federal government was planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in parliament. When questioned about the constitutional amendments in the pipeline on Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar had categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. He further clarified that no constitutional amendment could be introduced during a joint session of the parliament. The federal minister had said that the speculations were fictitious as President Asif Ali Zardari summoned a routine session of parliament. He, however, had confirmed that there was a chance for a joint session next week in which the legislators would take up some pending bills. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, had also said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now. It is worth mentioning that prior to the expected joint parliament session, President Zardari also summoned the session of the National Assembly on August 26 (today) and the Senate on August 27 (tomorrow) under Article 54(1) of the Constitution."

  "content": "LAHORE: The suspect arrested in Lahore for allegedly spreading disinformation about the Southport killings that triggered widespread riots in the United Kingdom was cleared of charges by a local court on Monday.  Farhan Asif was booked earlier this month for allegedly publishing a \"fake news\" story that purportedly caused the UK anti-immigrant riots, which saw numerous mosques, asylum centres and immigrant homes being attacked in several regions of Britain. In Pakistan, the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime wing was investigating the charges against Asif. During the hearing today, the investigation officer (IO) informed a judicial magistrate's court in Lahore that the \"news\" about the murder had been shared on social media previously and suspect Asif only \"re-shared\" it. \"The allegations have been investigated from every aspect and no evidence against the suspect has been found,\" the IO stated. At this, the court inquired about the time and person with whom the suspect shared the news. Asif, while responding to the query, stated that he deleted the news six hours after sharing it. After this, the court discharged the suspect and ordered his immediate release. Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were the three girls who were killed in the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town of Southport on July 29. The assault also left eight children and two adults wounded. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested. However, due to his age, his identity was not disclosed. However, misinformation about the suspect's Muslim identity began circulating online. Social media reports named him Ali-Al-Shakati, claiming he migrated to the UK by boat in 2023. These social media claims that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant triggered anti-immigrant riots across the UK."

AFPISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  has filed a civil miscellaneous application in the Supreme Court in response to the objections raised by the Election Commission of Pakistan ...",
  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has filed a civil miscellaneous application in the Supreme Court in response to the objections raised by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in implementing the top court's reserved seats ruling, saying that the polls regulators wanted to \"delay\" the process. The apex court, in its much-anticipated July 12 verdict, ruled that the former ruling party is allowed to have seats reserved for women and minorities in all legislatures including the National Assembly — a decision that will potentially turn the PTI into the largest party in the lower house of parliament. The Election Commission partially implemented the judicial order and on July 29 declared 93 lawmakers in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh assemblies as \"returned candidates\" of the Imran Khan-led party.   Prior to this, the polls regulator also declared 39 PTI lawmakers from the National Assembly as the candidates affiliated with the PTI. However, on July 25, the ECP approached the top court seeking judicial guidance  on certain legal and factual issues of the order.  Later, the election regulator on August 7 filed a review petition in the top court against the short verdict involving the PTI and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). In its petition, the ECP maintained that 80 independent candidates had decided to join the SIC and submitted relevant documents to declare their allegiance to the party. However, it added that the SIC did not participate in the February 8 nationwide polls as a political party nor submitted any list of candidates for the reserved seats. Today, the party of incarcerated Imran Khan has filed its application through its counsel Uzair Bhandari advocate, seeking the apex court to dismiss the Election Commission’s review petition, asking for SC’s clarification in connection with the execution of the July 12 short order. The PTI’s plea also mentioned the electoral body’s objection, saying the ECP has averred wrongly that “the commission is facing difficulty to implement the order ibid as PTI at the moment has no organizational structure for confirmation of statements of MNAs/MPAs”. The Imran-led party also requested the court to issue directives to the election-conducting body to accept the affidavits of allegiance filed by the independent lawmakers, signed by Barrister Gohar Khan and Omar Ayub, the elected chairman and General Secretary of PTI, respectively. The party also requested the court to direct the ECP to implement the July 12 short order. The PTI said that the Election Commission has filed the application with mala fide intentions, saying that the election regulatory body seeks to “circumvent and delay the implementation of the short order” as it aims to deny the party its “rightful share of the reserved seats”. Responding to the EC’s objection regarding the PTI’s organisational structure, the plea stated that the party’s organisation structure is well in place as the “PTI has taken all necessary steps and is in full compliance with the applicable law”. Responding to another objection, the plea further said the party conducted its intra-party elections on March 3, 2024 when Barrister Gohar Khan was elected unopposed as chairman of the party and Omar Ayub Khan also was elected unopposed as General Secretary. Later, the party submitted details of its intra-party election to the ECP on March 4, 2024, the plea said, adding the election body has since written a number of letters to PTI with some of the letters addressed to Barrister Gohar Khan, referring to him as the \"Chairman of PTI\".

  "content": "NORTH WAZIRISTAN: An explosion in the Razmak area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district killed at least four people, Geo News reported on Monday citing district administration. The blast took place in the Razmak Bazaar which also wounded more than 10 people who have been moved to a hospital, according to the administration. This incident comes at a time when Pakistan, particularly its KP and Balochistan provinces, are witnessing a surge in terror activities for the past few months. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the incident in Razmak, offering his condolences to the families of those who died in the attack. Expressing his determination to continue efforts for the complete elimination of terrorism from the country, the president prayed for the departed souls.  Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi also condemned the blast and offered his condolences to the families of those who died in the incident. \"The entire nation is determined to end terrorism,\" said Governor Kundi. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents are reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — KP and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

In Musa Khel district, terrorists stopped a bus in Rara Sham area and maliciously targeted innocent citizens, working in Balochistan to earn their livelihood, the ISPR said. It went on to say that security forces and law enforcement agencies immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists and \"sent 21 terrorists to hell in ensuing clearance operations, ensuring security and protection of local populace\". However, during the conduct of operations, the statement said 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies, having fought gallantly, made the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat. Sanitisation operations are being conducted and the instigators, perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these heinous and cowardly acts, targeting innocent civilians, will be brought to justice, the statement added. \"Security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,\" the military's media wing said. The clearance operations were launched as at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorists incidents in Balochistan. In one of the attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News on Monday. Providing details of the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai said armed men blocked the inter-provincial highway and offloaded passengers from the vehicles. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat, police told Geo News earlier today. Kalat Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dostin Dashti said those martyred in the incident included a police sub-inspector, four Levies personnel and five citizens. Militants also blew up a railway bridge in nearby Bolan district on a track that connects the province to Punjab and Sindh, with six dead bodies found nearby, said Javed Baloch, a senior government official in the district. Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest province, despite an abundance of untapped natural resources, and lags behind the rest of the country in education, employment and economic development. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed \"deep grief and condemnation over the terrorist attack\" in a statement issued Monday by his office.   — With additional input from AFP"

  "content": "Millions across Pakistan are observing the Chehlum of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) with religious zeal with several small and large mourning processions and religions gatherings planned in various cities amid heightened security measures. The day commemorates the 40-day-mark of the martyrdom of Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) and his family and features majalis and religious gatherings wherein scholars recall Imam Hussain's (RA) courage and determination to underscore need to stand up against injustice.   The authorities have enforced strict security measures, including a ban on pillion riding as well as suspension of cellular services in various cities. In Karachi, the main procession will depart from Nishtar Park and will culminate at Hussainian Iranian Imambargah after passing through traditional routes. The participants will offer noon prayers at Imambargah Ali Raza located at the MA Jinnah Road. Meanwhile, the majlis at Nishtar Park has already commenced with renowned scholar Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi addressing the participants. In Punjab's capital Lahore, the main Chehlum procession departed Haveli Alif Shah and is continuing on its traditional routes. The procession will culminate at Karbala Gamay Shah. Meanwhile, in Quetta, Chehlum procession departed from Alamdar Road near Shuhada Chowk and will culminate at Bahisht-e-Zainab graveyard.

Several processions are also planned in Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Mirpur Khas, Mianwali, Bahawalnagar, Kohat, Bannu, Parachinar, Gilgit, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and other cities. The mourning processions are being held amid strict security measures enforced by the authorities. In Karachi, roads leading to the main procession have been blocked with containers with Sindh Rangers and Sindh Police personnel providing security. Expert snipers have been deployed for the security of the main procession which will have aerial monitoring as well as via CCTV cameras. Cellular services have been suspended in various cities across Sindh, including Karachi, as part of the government's bid to ensure foolproof security for the Chehlum processions. The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) has said that mobile phone services have been suspended in Khairpur, Hyderabad, Larkana, Sukkur and Shikarpur. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar has directed the authorities to ensure foolproof security on the main procession's route along with an increase in intelligence gathering in the surrounding areas. The minister has also called for the bomb disposal squad's (BDS) deployment to be ensured for sweeping and clearance of the procession route as well as entry points. In Lahore, more than 5,000 police personnel have been deployed to provide security to the various processions across the city. Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddiqui Kamyana has said that a three-tier security is being provided to the people attending the processions. Security will remain on high alert until the end of processions and meetings, the police officer added. In Quetta, shops and business centres located on processions' routes have been sealed with entry points also being closed off. Furthermore, Police personnel have been deployed on the rooftops and entrances as well. Meanwhile, a ban has been imposed on the entry of cars and motorcycles into Parachinar along with the suspension of mobile services and the closure of the border with neighbouring Afghanistan, said Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud. Mobile services have also been suspended along the procession route in Rawalpindi with more than 4,600 security personnel along with 215 officers providing security. "

  "content": "KALAT: A police officer and four personnel of Balochistan Levies are among 10 people who were martyred in exchange of fire with assailants in Kalat, Geo News reported quoting sources as saying on Monday.  Whereas, security sources said that 12 terrorists were wiped out in retaliatory firing of police and law enforcement agencies.  Kalat Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dostin Dashti said a police sub-inspector, four Levies personnel and five citizens were included in those martyred in the incident. Dashti said police have launched an area clearance operation as the suspects managed to flee after the gun attack. “An exchange of fire between police and armed men continued since last night on Kalat's national highway and city,” the police said. Meanwhile, Kalat Assistant Commissioner Aftab Ahmed and a Levies man have also been injured in the firing.  Levies authorities said the wounded security person was admitted to a hospital. While, Kalat Commissioner Naeem Bazai said condition of Ahmed was out of danger.  Security sources told Geo News that terrorists attacked multiple sites in Balochistan on the night of August 24 and 25. In response to the attacks, the security forces and law enforcement agencies retaliated, killing 12 terrorists and leaving several others injured, the sources added. They said the security operation would continue until the terrorists were eliminated. In a separate terrorist attack, a railway bridge was blown up in Bolan’s Dozan area, said police. Following which, they said, local administration and railway authorities reached the incident’s site. Pakistan Railways said the railway service between Punjab and Sindh was suspended after destruction of the bridge. Railway authorities said track in Mastung and Sheikh Wasil areas were also destroyed through explosions, following which the goods train from Quetta to Taftan was also cancelled. On the other hand, Bolan Mail and Jaffer Express could not leave from Quetta for Karachi and Rawalpindi, respectively, as train operation was suspended after the railway bridge explosion, they said.  Moreover, trains coming to Quetta from Sindh and Punjab were also stopped at different points, the authorities said. Bolan Mail coming from Karachi was stopped at Larkana station and a train coming from Rawalpindi was stopped in Sukkur, they added. In view of the multiple terrorist attacks, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind said Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had convened an important huddle. He said the terrorists struck two to three sites during the last night, including the incident wherein some passengers were identified and dislodged from vehicles. “It will take some time to repair the affected railway bridge,” he said, raising suspicion that the bridge was apparently blown up with the help of an explosive device. On the other hand, a group of armed men set several vehicles and record on fire at a Levies station in Mastung, Levies sources told Geo News. Levies maintained that no personnel was harmed in the attack. They added that the armed persons had seized the station and it was vacated through operation of security forces. No suspect could be held as they managed to escape from the building. However, a dead body of an unidentified person was found near the station, said Levies. Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said four bodies of unidentified persons were found in Kolpur area of Bolan. “They were killed by gunfire and their bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital,” said the authority, adding that the identification process of the bodies was being carried out. In his remarks on the law and order situation unfolding in Balochistan, Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi said the facts would be brought forward with evidence on the terrorist incidents after an investigation. “The incidents of terror are a conspiracy to create instability in Pakistan. The enemy wants to create anarchy in the country under a well thought out plan,” he said, confirming that the security forces and law enforcers took timely action and neutralised 12 terrorists. He said every possible step would be taken to establish peace in the province marred by violence.  “Terrorists and their facilitators will not find a place to hide,” he said, adding that he was in touch with the Balochistan government. Additionally, Naqvi said, he shared the grief of the martyrs’ families.  He said the war would continue until the complete eradication of terrorism. The law and order situation in Balochistan was being monitored on a regular basis, he maintained."

  "content": "QUETTA: In a grim tragedy, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel, police told Geo News on Monday. Providing details of the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ayub Achakzai said armed men blocked the inter-provincial highway and offloaded passengers from the vehicles. Police and Levies reached the site of the incident and bodies were being shifted to the hospital, he added. Speaking during Geo News programme \"Geo Pakistan\", Balochistan government's spokesperson Shahid Rind said that the militants had attacked on two to three fonts where they faced retaliation and resistance from the security forces and law enforcement agenceis (LEAs). However, he added, that the terrorists exploited the dark to carry out the Musakhel attack where they offloaded the passengers from the buses and shot them after identification. Underscoring the provincial government's resolve to address the law and order issue, Rind said that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had summoned a meeting wherein \"important decisions\" would be made. \"To find a way out of this situation, a wholesome approach is required by any political government or security forces and support is needed from all schools of thought,” he said. The Musakhel incident comes as Balochistan remains embroiled in security-related challenges. On the other hand, Pakistan has witnessed a spike in terrorism-related incidents since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror activities are reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Owing to the security situation, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism. Condemning the heinous incident, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of precious human lives and termed the perpetrators as “enemies of the nation”. The president also said the terrorists responsible for the brutal killings must be brought to justice. Expressing anger and sorrow over the Musakhel killings, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the local administration to cooperate with the bereaved families and provide immediate medical assistance to the injured. The premier has also ordered LEAs to investigate the brutal killings. \"The terrorists responsible for the Musakhel incident will be punished. The war against terrorists will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism from the country,\" PM Shehbaz said."

AFP/FileLAHORE: The embattled Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  on Sunday postponed yet another power show which was scheduled...",
  "content": "LAHORE: The embattled Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday postponed yet another power show which was scheduled for August 27 in Lahore after calling off its public gathering in Islamabad three days ago. The former ruling party's Secretary of Information for Punjab, Shaukat Mahmood Basra, has said that a new date would soon be announced for the Lahore rally after their \"power show\" in the federal capital on September 8. He assured that the Imran Khan-founded party would pay full attention to its forthcoming major political event. The development is being dubbed another dent in the political reputation of the embattled party, which has suffered back-to-back setbacks in holding its political events. Earlier, the PTI had announced it would rally in Islamabad's Tarnol at any cost, despite the revocation of the no objection certificate (NOC) by the local administration, which also sealed roads leading to the federal capital. Later, the party, in a last-minute move, rescheduled its public gathering for September 8. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan announced that the rally had been postponed on the directives of party founder Imran Khan. Meanwhile, in a recent audio statement, Aleema Khan, sister of the incarcerated ex-premier, resented the move, criticising the PTI leadership for not having any \"real intention\" of getting the party founder out of jail. A short audio clip, purportedly featuring the voice of Aleema Khan, is doing rounds on social media, in which a woman can be heard expressing dismay over the postponement of the rally. She questioned why Azam Swati, a senior PTI leader, visited Imran early in the morning and on whose behest. \"Who instructed him [Swati] to meet Imran at 7 am and deliver a message regarding the rally’s postponement?\" Aleema further asked why they were consulting the PTI founder, who is currently incarcerated at Rawalpindi's Adiala jail and came down hard on the party's top brass for dragging their feet on making timely decisions. However, the federal government's spokesperson on legal affairs, Barrister Aqeel Malik, claimed that the Centre approached Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for the cancellation of the public gathering. He also confirmed that the party had been given conditional permission for a rally on September 8. In a statement, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said this development had exposed cracks within the Imran-founded party, as they would never postpone their power show if there was any chance of its success. He alleged that the PTI is desperately trying to launch another false narrative to save its diminishing popularity. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader claimed that the incumbent government would protect national unity at any cost and fight those working on a \"foreign agenda\"."

  "content": "SIALKOT: Criticising Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf over its \"negative politics\", Minister for Defence Khawaja Asif has said that rifts within the PTI are evident following the abrupt postponement of the August 22 rally in Islamabad.  The Imran Khan-led former ruling party put off its public gathering in the federal capital and rescheduled it for September 8 as the local administration revoked the no-objection certificate (NOC) and sealed roads leading to Islamabad. PTI leaders Gohar Ali Khan and Azam Swati had claimed that the gathering was deferred on instructions of the PTI founder after they met the incarcerated former prime minister at 7am in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail ahead of the much-hyped public rally. However, several party leaders — including Imran's sister Aleema Khan — contradicted the top leaders' statements. Speaking to the media on Sunday (today), the defence czar solidified his stance by pointing out the recent audio clip of Aleema Khan and her WhatsApp chat with Raoof Hasan regarding Imran's wife Bushra Bibi.    Aleema had expressed a lack of confidence in the current PTI leadership, saying that they have no \"real intention\" of freeing the ousted premier from jail, who was removed from power via a parliamentary vote in April 2022. In a short audio clip, she also questioned why Swati paid a visit to Imran early in the morning and who instructed him to do so.  Meanwhile, Asif claimed that the PTI had postponed the August 22 rally over \"fear of rejection\" from the masses. \"Imran would not have cancelled the rally, if it was meant to be successful,\" he said, dismissing the notion of the establishment's interference in the PTI's decision. Currently, he also said, the PTI wants to build another \"false narrative\" to desperately save its diminishing popularity.  The minister also lambasted the former ruling party for denying involvement in the May 9 riots — wherein military installations came under attack after the former PM was arrested. \"The faces of the elements involved in the vandalism can be indisputably recognised in the videos,\" he said, referring to the PTI leaders who were recorded protesting on May 9, 2023. In response to a question regarding Imran's meeting with Swati in Adiala Jail, Asif said: \"Meetings or conversations in jail cannot remain a secret, your every movement is recorded.\" \"Work is being carried out on foreign agenda,\" he said, adding that they would vigorously fight it and defend Pakistan's national unity. He also labelled Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, 'Buzdar 2' and said he has even surpassed the former Punjab chief executive in terms of failure of governance. \"A blame game is underway in the PTI-led province as his [Gandapur] cabinet members are calling him [a] thieve,\" he added. Responding to another question, the federal minister said that it doesn't matter whether the Democrats or the Republicans come into power in the United States. \"We have to change our fate ourselves, the US cannot.\""

  "content": "KARACHI: Two armed groups clashed in Karachi's Golimar area on Sunday, resulting in the deaths of at least two people and injuries to nine others, according to police personnel, as reported by Geo News. The casualties ensued when two armed groups opened fire on each other, with some angry protesters setting various vehicles on fire and blocking both lanes of the main artery leading to Nazimabad from Lasbella. Confirming the number of fatalities, Chief Police Surgeon Dr Sumaiyya Syed stated that one body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and the other to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, while the injured were being treated at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC). Taking notice of the matter, Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar has sought a report on the incident from the Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Additional Inspector General (AIG), directing law enforcement agencies to bring the situation under control immediately. Saying that no one would be allowed to take the law into their own hands or disturb the law and order situation, Lanjar also instructed the authorities to arrest the perpetrators as soon as possible. Later, Karachi AIG Javed Alam Odho stated that the situation in the affected area was under control and the Central Superintendent of Police (SSP) was on site. Meanwhile, West DIG Irfan Baloch stated that the armed groups clashed over the movement of a procession. Later, the flow of traffic resumed after the law enforcers opened the roads. "

  "content": "A policeman kidnapped by Katcha dacoits from Rahim Yar Khan's riverine Machka area two days ago has been rescued by the Punjab Police in an operation, a spokesperson announced on Sunday. On Thursday, a group of Katcha bandits blew up two police vehicles with a rocket in Machka, martyring 12 cops and wounding six others. Constable Ahmed Nawaz was abducted by robbers heavily armed with sophisticated modern weaponry after the attack on police mobile. In a statement, Rizwan Omar Gondal, District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan, said that the police department was working with full strength in the riverine areas. Constable Nawaz was reportedly released in exchange for dacoit Jabbar Lolai, who had been in police custody, according to sources cited by Geo News. However, the police have neither confirmed nor denied this exchange. A video circulating on social media showed Katcha bandits celebrating with gunfire following the release of their accomplice. After Nawaz’s release, Punjab Police Inspector General (IG) Dr Usman Anwar met with the constable's family to inform them of his safe return. Dr Anwar stated that every member of the Punjab Police was crucial to the force, and Nawaz's recovery was a top priority for his department. He also emphasised that the Punjab Police were prepared to deal firmly with terrorists, assailants, and criminals. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz appreciated the police on a successful operation in Katcha to safely recover the abducted constable. She praised DPO Gondal and his team, saying they had done a commendable job. She expressed her best wishes for Constable Nawaz and his family, and said: \"We thank Allah Almighty for his safe recovery.\" Bandit groups in riverine areas have always been a hurdle in maintaining law and order for the provincial governments in Sindh and Punjab despite conducting multiple operations to eliminate them. A National Action Plan implementation review committee decided in a meeting at the National Counter Terror­ism Auth­ority (NACTA) headquarters in April to launch a joint operation of Sindh and Punjab police forces against notorious dacoits of the katcha areas in Sindh. The directives were issued by Interior Minister Naqvi who chaired the high-level meeting attended by the interior secretary, heads of Nacta and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), police chiefs of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) and provincial home secretaries."

  "content": "KURRAM: Terrorists on Sunday attacked a police checkpost in Central Kurram, leaving one policeman martyred and injuring another, police told Geo News. The terrorist, according to  District Police Officer Ahmed Khan, set fire to the checkpost after the gun attack. The martyred policeman was identified as Qoowat Khan, while Constable Shahzad has been injured in the attack. He has been shifted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Sadda in Central Kurram for treatment. Funeral prayer of the martyred policeman has been offered in the wake of the attack. The region has witnessed multiple similar incidents for the last few months. Earlier this month, security forces gunned down seven terrorists and wounded five others during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Kurram district with the determination to eliminate the menace of terrorism. \"On August 15, 2024, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Kurram district on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said in a statement. Pakistan has experienced a spike in terrorism since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Most terror incidents reported in provinces bordering the neighbouring country — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, during the second quarter of the current year, the country witnessed 380 violence-linked fatalities and 220 injuries among civilians, security personnel, and outlaws. The report stated that these casualties resulted from as many as 240 incidents involving terror attacks and counter-terrorism operations. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "World's youngest Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai has highlighted the plight of young Palestinian girls enduring the consequences of Israel's ongoing assault of the besieged enclave. Sharing an Instagram story of a young girl, who has lost her hair due to stress and torment caused by Israel's military onslaught in Gaza, the education activist has called for an immediate ceasefire to protect innocent people. \"This is the trauma Palestinian girls are facing under Israel's bombardment — no peace, no school. We need a ceasefire now and protect these children's lives,\" she wrote.  Malala has, time and again, raised her voice for the rights of Palestinian children and has condemned Israel’s attacks on Gaza, particularly on educational institutes.  The eight-year-old Sama Tabil — in an interview with Al-Jazeera — detailed how she once adored her hair and that she was now being ridiculed for her baldness. With teary eyes, the little girl expressed her desire to travel abroad to get treatment so she could \"be beautiful again\". In the heartbreaking video, the little girl said she was a good student in school and would do her hair everyday before going to school.  The girl was displaced with her family after Israeli forces’ assault on their camp in Rafah. Sama said she and her family were sleeping when the attack took place and they woke up to the sounds of gunfire and bomb explosions.  Several days after the incident, her hair started falling off her hair. Sama’s mother said she saw dead bodies and ruins, following the bombardment which traumatised her.  “The constant fear of shelling and lack of security has rubbed salt into the wound,” she said.  She said the Israeli forces' deadly strikes have deprived Sama of her childhood. In the Khan Younis camp, other girls tease her by calling her bald and a cancer patient, said the eight-year-old. “It really hurts,” she added.  Amid medicines' shortage, doctors cannot treat her in the besieged territory. UNICEF has warned that children in Gaza are facing mental health crisis."

  "content": "KARACHI: A weather analyst on Sunday said light to heavy rain was likely to lash Karachi between Tuesday and Thursday. Talking to Geo News, Owais Haider shared his prediction for the following week. He said the suburban parts of the port city might experience rain on Monday.  However, the weatherman warned that a threat of urban flooding lied ahead as this rain spell could be the most powerful spell of this monsoon season. Meanwhile, Haider added, there were chances of rain in different parts of Karachi on Friday as well. On the other hand, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said Karachi’s weather was expected to remain hot and humid in the next 24 hours. According to the Met Office, the city's current temperature was 30°C and the maximum temperature was likely to reach 36°C in the city. It said humidity in the air was 70%, while sea breezes were restored. \"Sea winds are blowing at a speed of 27 kilometres per hour,\" said the weather forecasting department. Amid predictions of heavy downpour in southern parts of the country, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab on Saturday imposed a rain emergency in Karachi. The PMD, in its latest update, said a new rain system located over west Bengal is likely to move westwards during the next couple of days, which would bring strong monsoon currents in Pakistan's southern parts on the night of August 25. It added that heavy rains were expected from August 26 to 29 under this system, prompting the concerned authorities to take emergency measures. Taking the predictions into account, Karachi Mayor Wahab announced that a rain emergency has been imposed to deal with the post-rain situation in the metropolis. He added that instructions were given to the municipal services of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and leaves of all concerned staffers were suspended to cope with the expected rains. As per the Met Office, the areas in Sindh that are likely to receive showers include Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allayar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tharparkar, Nagarparkar, Mithi, Mirpur Khas, Umarkot, Matiari, Sanghar, Sukkur, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Khairpur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Naushero Feroze. Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority's (NDMA) National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) also issued warning to relevant departments to stay alert in anticipation of torrential rains in Sindh and Punjab from August 26 to 29. The authority warned that besides flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and hill torrents in Punjab, coastal flooding may also occur along Makran's coast and in low laying areas of Dadu, Hyderabad, Badin and Shahdadpur district of Sindh. The NDMA, in its statement, urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains. It also instructed the departments to alert Emergency Response Teams and mobilised resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. The public has also been advised to remain vigilant and follow instructions from local authorities."

  "content": "Days after alleged reports of automated teller machines (ATMs) facing closures across Pakistan began circulating, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has issued a clarification, busting the \"fake news\". In a statement issued on Saturday night, telecommunication body refuted the issue being cited in alleged reports floating on WhatsApp and other social media sites. \"In response to the fake news circulating in the media about potential closure of ATMs, it is clarified that currently there is no such issue of non availability/closure of LDI networks that may potentially impact IT or financial sector including ATM networks,\" PTA said in its statement. The authority added that operations of the expired LDI licensees are not suspended or shutdown. A day earlier, a banking consortium, which manages the country's major e-payment gateway, also denied the \"fake\" reports regarding ATM closures. \"The public is advised not to pay any attention to such hoaxes and consult their banks for any guidance,\" the consortium stated. Earlier this week, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) spokesperson Noor Ahmad told Geo Fact Check that the claims are false. He then referred to a statement from the consortium denying the reports as well. It should be noted that fake news circulating on WhatsApp and social media in Pakistan had warned people to avoid using ATMs and online banking for the next few days due to an alleged \"ransomware attack\"."

  "content": "HUB/LASBELA: At least 11 people have died and more than 30 are injured after a bus carrying pilgrims travelling to Iran plunged into a ditch on the Makran Coastal Highway, police told Geo News on Sunday. The pilgrims — belonging to Lahore and Gujranwala, as per the police — were travelling from Punjab to Iran when their bus met the ill-fated accident due to a brake failure, Lyari Station House Officer Qadir said. Levies, police and other departments are carrying out a rescue operation, Lasbela Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retd) Naveed Alam said, confirming the death toll and injuries.

In a court hearing on Aug 21, a counsel of the victim had called for a probe into the “kind of drug” that the suspect was allegedly under the influence of at the time of the accident. The court had subsequently sent Danish on a 14-day judicial remand. IG Memon had previously said that the report of the driver’s blood test was expected soon, and in light of the medical reports, more sections would be added to the first information report (FIR) to guide the future course of action related to the probe. Talking to Dawn.com today, IG Memon said the medical examiner’s office for the Sindh Government Services Hospital issued the medical reports of the driver. “The medical report confirms that she was under the influence of the drug methamphetamine,” he told Dawn.com. The report has not yet been made public. Earlier in the day, Karachi Additional IG (AIG) Javed Odho also said that there was “something” in the medical report based on which he could say that the driver should not have been in the speeding vehicle. In a brief exchange with a reporter, the Karachi police chief addressed media reports regarding the issuance of the driver’s medical report, stating that the investigation was still ongoing. “I did not want to talk about it in a candid manner at this moment,” AIG Odho said. However, he added that “something” about the findings of the report suggested that Danish should not have been driving the vehicle. He said investigators would approach medical authorities before reaching a “final conclusion” and seek opinions from medical experts. The FIR The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed at the Bahadurabad police station on the complaint of Imtiaz Arif, whose brother and niece died in the accident. The FIR invoked sections 320 (punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving), 337-G (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent driving), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the complaint, Arif was informed at around 6:45pm on Monday that his brother Imran Arif, who was riding a motorcycle along with his daughter Amna Arif, was met with an accident. Upon reaching the JPMC, the complainant found out that the suspect, who was driving a Toyota Land Cruiser, had hit his brother’s motorcycle from behind. “Abdussalam, son of Mohammad Ishaq, who was riding on the motorcycle was also injured,” the FIR stated, adding that Imran and his daughter got several injuries and passed away later.

  "description": "The local administration has barred the Quetta Press Club from hosting events by organisations or political parties without a non-objection certificate (NOC), it emerged on Wednesday. A notification from the office of the Quetta deputy commissioner, dated Tuesday, to the press club’s president said: “Owing to current law and order situation, no any organisation/political party is allowed to organise any conference/seminar in Quetta Press Club without prior approval/permission of district administration. “Therefore, you are hereby directed not to allow any organisation/political party to organise conference/seminar without NOC/permission district administration.” Dawn.com contacted the deputy commissioner’s office for a response but received none. Meanwhile, a meeting of the press club’s executive body was called for Thursday to deliberate on the deputy commissioner’s notification and chart out the future plan of action. The restriction comes amid a tense security situation after dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks on Sunday midnight across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians, particularly those hailing from Punjab. At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives as militants went on a rampage across the province, storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In May, the police and local administration locked the press club’s gates to stop the members of rights group Baloch Yakjehti Committee from holding a seminar. The Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ) and press club had decided to launch a country-wide protest campaign against the locking up by the district administration and police. Condemnations from press bodies The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) condemned the Quetta administration for the restrictions. A statement issued by the body said it took “serious exception” to the direction issued by the Quetta district administration to the press club president. PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari condemned the actions, saying, “This is an attempt to curb free speech and press freedom in the country, and it is rejected and will not be accepted.” They called for the urgent withdrawal of the written direction and asked the administration to desist from such “ruthless practices.” They stressed that press freedom and the right to express oneself were guaranteed in the Constitution and would be safeguarded at all costs. “The PFUJ leadership noted that the law and order situation has not been created due to speeches and freedom of expression, but rather is a result of denial of rights, injustices in society and authoritarian behaviours of the establishment and crippled state machinery. “They called for respect for premises like press clubs, which are meant for upholding and promoting freedom of the press and expression in the country,” the statement said. BUJ General Secretary Abdul Shakoor condemned the move and termed it an attack on press freedom. He said the Quetta Press Club played the role of a bridge between the people and the government. “There are political and cultural activities through which people make their voices heard in relevant forums,” Shakoor said. Calling for such measures to be reviewed, he said the BUJ and Quetta Press Club had fulfilled their responsibilities in the past as well even before the current situation. The Karachi Press Club (KPC) also condemned the directive in a statement. “This unprecedented move is a blatant attack on the fundamental principles of freedom of press and freedom of speech,” said KPC President Saeed Sarbazi. “Press clubs have historically served as vital platforms for public discourse, and imposing such restrictions undermines their very purpose.” The KPC said the directive had “sparked widespread concern” among journalists and civil society activists with them arguing that it was a “direct attempt to stifle dissent and control the narrative”. The statement said KPC General Secretary Shoaib Ahmed echoed Sarbazi’s concerns. “Any interference in the affairs of press clubs is a dangerous precedent,” he said. “Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy, and it must be protected from such arbitrary restrictions.” The statement further noted that the move came at a time when tensions between the government and opposition parties have been escalating. “Some fear that the directive is aimed at silencing critical voices and consolidating government control. “The KPC has called on the authorities to reconsider the directive and respect the autonomy of press clubs. They argue that freedom of the press is essential for a vibrant and informed citizenry.” "

  "description": "The “main suspect” involved in gang-rape and murder of a 12-year old girl in Karachi was arrested, police said on Wednesday. A 12-year girl was found raped and murdered in Karachi’s Saddar area on Sunday. According to Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed, the girl’s body, which was found in a bag, was brought to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) by Saddar police for medical examination.      Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had taken notice of the rape and murder of the minor and had directed the police to take immediate action and ensure the arrest of the culprits involved. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza, while talking to Dawn.com, said that the arrested individual — who worked as a watchman at Bara Market near Cantonment Station — was the main suspect in the crime. DIG Raza said that the police had identified three suspects involved in the incident, however, the two others — employees of the Shalimar bus terminal — had fled. The victim lived underneath the Lilly Bridge at Cantt. Station along with her mother. She was playing at the bus terminus when the suspects kidnapped her, DIG said, adding that they took her to their office where they committed the heinous crime. He said that police had arrested the suspects with the help of the CCTV footage and by utilising technical resources. He said the police had taken DNA samples of seven people and interrogated more than 20 suspects. He said this was a challenging case for the police but with the help of CCTV footage, investigators identified the bike and the suspects. “The suspects involved in the girl’s rape and murder would be taken to task,” the south zone police head said. In March this year, data released by Sahil — an NGO working for the welfare of children — revealed that in 2023, a total of 4,213 child abuse cases had been reported from all four provinces as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. A gender-divide analysis of the data showed that out of the total reported cases, 2,251 (53 per cent) of victims were girls and 1,962 (47 per cent) were boys. The reported age showed that children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 6-15 years, in which more cases of boys than girls were reported. Moreover, children as young as 0-5 years were also sexually abused. The abuser’s category indicated that acquaintances were still the most involved in child sexual abuse, along with relatives, family members, strangers, and women abettors. "

  "description": "The German Embassy in Islamabad has announced that the volume of student visa applications for the winter semester has far surpassed their capacity, therefore, they will likely be able to process only the “most deserving” ones. The statement was made on Monday in response to a Dawn.com query regarding the matter. In numerous identical emails sent to Dawn.com over the past weeks, students complained of facing delays in securing visa interview appointments at the German Embassy in Islamabad despite being granted admission to universities. The emails claimed that the appointment system for study visas had been opened on May 21 for students admitted for the winter semester. However, no appointment had been scheduled for applying through the “normal track” and only “fast-track applicants” seemed to be receiving attention, the students lamented. Two such students detailed the costly process and the difficulties they faced to Dawn.com. “Regrettably, during the current academic year, it will therefore most likely only be possible to process the visa applications of the most deserving students, generally those who have been granted a public scholarship and those with the best school or undergraduate results,” the embassy’s communications sections said on Monday.      The embassy acknowledged that there was “huge interest” shown by Pakistani students to study in Germany. It added that as a result, the number of applications for German visas “currently greatly exceeds the embassy’s resources”. Noting that the number of visas processed at the German Embassy in Islamabad was “constantly increasing”, the embassy said it was looking into improvements that could be made to address the limitation. “We hope to improve the situation further in the upcoming academic years,” the embassy affirmed. ‘Wasted expenses’ Speaking to Dawn.com, former National University of Sciences and Technology (Nust) student Hamza Amjad said he had invested a substantial amount of money in applying for a visa, including nearly €500 — approximately Rs150,000 — for the summer intake, 2024. He added that his blocked account in Germany had €11,208 — approximately Rs3.4 million — that remain frozen and could only be accessed upon his arrival in the country. “Expenses for accommodation booking and a semester ticket were also wasted as I could not join the university due to these appointment issues,” Amjad said. Abdullah Yasin, a former student of Bahria University Islamabad, told Dawn.com that he had applied to multiple German universities right after his graduation in 2022 and got admitted. However, Yasin added, that his admissions kept on being cancelled because of issues with the visa appointments.      While the former Nust student has obtained an admission letter from the Technical University in Ilmenau, it seems he would have to wait for another semester. Yasin further said he spent approximately Rs300,000 on the process, adding that his International English Language Testing System (Ielts) test would go to waste given its two-year validity. The issue of a lack of appointments scheduled by the German Embassy in Pakistan for visa applications is not new. According to a statement issued in May by the embassy, it had not fulfilled all appointment requests for the summer semester either “due to the enormous interest of potential students” which “far exceeded the capacities of the embassy”. The embassy had said that due to the high demand for student visas, applicants in the sub-categories of Bachelor’s and Master’s students holding an unconditional direct admission letter from a German university could expect a longer waiting time for an appointment at the embassy. It had highlighted that holders of scholarships and PhD students would be prioritised. Another exclusive online registration category catering to students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.7 or above would also be prioritised, the embassy had said. "

  "description": "Internet services across the country are expected to remain slow till “early October” as the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said on Wednesday that the submarine cable responsible for the disruptions would likely be repaired by then. Internet speeds have witnes­sed a considerable decline over the past few weeks, and users are facing difficulties in sending or down­loading media and voice notes through WhatsApp when connected to mobile data, and experiencing slow browsing speeds, even on broadband. The business community and internet service providers (ISPs) had alleged that the government’s efforts to monitor internet traffic — including a so-called ‘firewall’ — had caused the slowdown of digital services, resulting in economic losses. While the country’s information techno­logy minister, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, had confirmed that the government was upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cyber security threats, she has categorically denied rep­orts of the government “throttling” the internet. The PTA, on the other hand, had last week blamed the internet slowdown on a faulty submarine cable, while dismissing fears that the state was installing a firewall. In a statement issued today, the PTA said the cyber slowdown was due to two submarine cables, one of which was yet to be repaired. “The ongoing internet slowdown across the country is mainly due to [a] fault in two (SMW4, AAE-1) of the seven international submarine cables connecting Pakistan internationally. “It is updated that [the] fault in SMW-4 submarine cable is likely to be repaired by early October 2024,” the telecom authority said. “Submarine cable AAE-1 has been repaired which may improve internet experience,” the PTA highlighted.      A week ago, PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, a retired major general, had said the damaged submarine cable would be repaired by August 27. The PTA chief had made the claim before a National Assembly panel, where he faced tough questions from both the government and the opposition lawmakers. Amnesty International has called on Pakistani authorities to provide greater transparency on the nationwide internet slowdown and the use of monitoring and surveillance technologies. Reasons for cyber slowdown Doug Madory, an internet expert, did endorse the claim regarding the fault in the submarine cables, saying the reduced internet capacity for Pakistan was due to a fault in submarine cables. “We can see that PTCL (AS17557) lost transit from TMnet (AS4788), NTT (AS2914) and Lumen (AS3356) as a result of the SMW-4 failure on June 17th. It recently regained Lumen, but these losses would indeed result in reduced capacity for Pakistan,” Madory said in a post on X on Aug 21. However, speaking to Gadinsider, Madory pointed out that the submarine cable break had occurred in June and if the internet issues “started in the past couple of weeks, then there must be another factor at play” than that cable damage. According to today’s PTA statement, the cable yet to be repaired is SMW-4 — the same one that Madory said faced a fault on June 17. The PTA has listed four reasons before the Lahore High Court (LHC) for the slowdown — a damaged submarine cable, a misconfiguration in an ISP’s system, possible cyber-attacks on August 15, and the increased use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for those using them.      The government has also blamed the widespread use of VPNs, which have seen increased usage due to the prolonged ban on social media platform X. Earlier this month, the PTA, referring to its plan to regulate the use of VPNs, clarified it was whitelisting them through an “automated process” to ensure the “smooth and secure functioning of the IT services and online businesses”. Possible losses to economy The Telecom Operators Association has warned that the sluggish internet could cost Pakistan almost Rs12 billion annually. Incidentally, the corresponding loss to exchequer due to reduced revenue of the telecom sector will be in excess of Rs3bn annually,“ it further said. The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has also sounded the alarm on several multinational companies planning to relocate their back offices from Pakistan. The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) had earlier said the country’s economy could lose up to $300 million due to internet disruptions caused by the imposition of a national firewall. "

  "description": "Traders across major cities of Pakistan observed a shutter-down strike on Wednesday against the government’s much-touted tax reforms, including the Tajir Dost Scheme. In March, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) introduced the ‘Tajir Dost Scheme’ to bring traders and wholesalers into the formal tax structure as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The move had led to concerns and reservations among the traders. Earlier this month, the traders’ community, including Markazi Tanzeem-i-Tajran Pakistan and All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran, announced a nationwide strike against the Tajir Dost Scheme as well as heavy taxation and inflated electricity bills. Trader’s bodies have decried the tax challans — to the tune of Rs60,000 — issued to small businesses and retailers, saying those registered under the scheme were promised they would not have to pay more than Rs1,200 in taxes. The expansion of the country’s tax base will now pose a significant challenge for the PML-N and its coalition partner, the PPP, as the protesting traders have political affiliations with these parties. Nevertheless, opposition parties — Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), and the Awami National Party — have declared their support for the agitating traders. Shutters in various parts of the country — including the metropolitan cities of Karachi and Lahore — remained closed as the call for strike from traders’ associations received an overwhelming response from the community.      Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), had urged all its members to fully support Wednesday’s countrywide strike by closing their businesses. Muhammad Kamran Arbi, president of the Site Association of Industry, has extended firm support to the traders’ strike. The Korangi Association of Trade and Industry and the Central Association of Tajran Pakistan have also announced their support. The Pakistan Oil Tankers’ Association, in its statement issued on Tuesday, said it “fully supported” the call for a strike by the trader’s community and the JI. The oil tankers’ body asserted the strike was the “voice of the country’s poor, helpless and destitute public against the heavy taxes and atrocious electricity bills”. The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) also endorsed the call for a strike, the chief of its Karachi chapter, Mufti Qasim Fakhri, said in a statement. Criticising the government for “enjoying privileges amid sky-high inflation”, Fakhri termed the imposition of taxes a “part of a foreign conspiracy”. “Where are those who made promises to the public while seeking their votes?” the TLP leader asked. Sindh Hakeem Shah, chairman of the All Karachi Traders Alliance, said in a statement that the shutter-down strike was being observed “all across from Karachi to Khyber”.    Demonstrators burn tyres on a road in Karachi as they protest against tax reforms amid a shutter-down strike on Aug 28, 2024. DawnNewsTV  Shah said the traders’ community could “no longer bear the burden of the rulers’ pleasures”. “The country is on the brink of disaster due to the rulers’ wrong policies,” he asserted. “If the Tajir Dost Scheme is not withdrawn, we will go ahead with a confrontational movement,” Shah warned. JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar called the ‘Tajir Dost Scheme’ (trader-friendly scheme) a “tajir dushman scheme” (traders’ enemy scheme). Speaking to the media in Karachi, Zafar said: “You (government) burdened the salaried class with taxes and you burdened traders with taxes under the ‘tajir dushman scheme’.”    JI’s Monem Zafar speaks to media in Karachi as rain pours on Aug 28, 2024. — DawnNewsTV  Slamming the government for being “enemies” of the common citizens through imposing harsh tax policies, the JI leader said, “Whether it is the Zardari family or the Sharif family, we do not accept these policies.” “The people do not accept this (taxes) and we once again demand that the politicians stop using delay tactics and giving ‘lollipops’ to the traders and the business community,” Zafar said. On the other hand, Sindh government spokesperson Ghanwar Isran Ali claimed that the JI had forced schools to remain shut, adding that the party’s “hooliganism” was “condemnable”. “Tactics to undermine the rule of law and to spread fear among the citizens will not be tolerated,” he said in a statement. Ali added it was “shameful to prioritise one’s political interests over the public’s well-being and progress”. Punjab In Lahore, shops on Hall Road, where the JI has set up a camp to mobilise traders and the general public, as well as on Mall Road, remained closed as traders observed the strike. According to a Dawn.com correspondent based in Lahore, the strike extended to Multan, Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and other cities of Punjab as well. Merchants on the Chakwal-Talagang road and in the main market of Kharian city kept their shops closed.    Shopkeepers in Faisalabad observe a shutter-down strike against tax reforms on Aug 28, 2024. — DawnNewsTV  In Islamabad, in a rare show of unity, not only traders and small businesses but many outlets of national clothing brands participated in the shutter-down strike. Contrary to the previous protest strikes and shutter-downs by the business community, even tea stalls, local restaurants and tandoors suspended their activities against the ‘Tajir Dost Scheme’. “Apart from the top-line food chains, we requested all branded clothing outlets and other stores to be part of the strike and they obliged to our request,” said Abdul Rehman, president of the Traders Welfare Association of F-7 Markaz. The strike was also observed at other high-end markets, including Blue Area and F-6 Markaz. The impact of the shutter-down protest was clearly visible in the low and midlevel markets of Islamabad as well as in the outskirts of the city. Thanks to the support of the Nanbai Association, almost all the tandoors in the capital remained closed on Wednesday. At the same time, however, the city’s meat shops were closed due to their weekly off. The supporters of the two main rival bodies of traders — the Markazi Tanzeem-i-Tajran Pakistan and the Anjuman Tajiran Pakistan (ATP) — were seen surveying the markets together to ensure that the strike call was being observed. The leaders of the traders’ bodies termed the shutter-down strike as a referendum against the “malpractices” of the FBR. “We demand the government to reform the tax collecting body to bridge the trust deficit between the tax payers and the FBR,” said ATP President Ajmal Baloch. “Nobody is against tax payment or being in the tax net. But can anybody, including the prime minister or the army chief, give the guarantee that there will not be any harassment by FBR officials as they do with industrialists and importers?” Baloch said. Due to the shutter down strike, the number of commuters in local transport services too was less than normal. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa In KP, traders and transporters across the Malakand and Hazara divisions observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike against the heavy taxes. Rallies in various cities of the province were also carried out with the support of the JI.    Commuters make their way through a partially deserted street during a nationwide strike called by trade organisations against excessive taxes, in Peshawar on Aug 28, 2024. — AFP  Abdur Rahim, the divisional president of a Malakand trade union, highlighted that the division was merged with Pakistan in 1969 under an agreement that exempted it from all kinds of taxes. However, the recent imposition of taxes was beyond his understanding, he said. Rahim further said that the residents of Malakand were paying huge taxes indirectly through inflated utility bills and mobile prepaid services. He added that the entire country was using their resources — particularly “electricity generated from the KP rivers” — but despite their agitations, meetings, and promises, the people there already “hit by militancy and disaster had never been facilitated or benefited”. “The entire business community is united in this cause,” said Muhammad Zada, the president of a trade union in Shangla district’s Bisham tehsil.    Shops in KP’s Shangla district observe a shutter-down strike against tax reforms on Aug 28, 2024. — Photo via Umar Bacha  Zada emphasised that the “only demand was that the government decrease the electricity rates and reverse the decision of tax net expansion to Malakand division”. He said traders in Bisham would also stage a protest rally in the afternoon on the Karakoram Highway to pressure the government to make “positive decisions in support of the business community and instead impose taxes on landlords, as well as end the agreements with independent power producers”. In Hazara Division’s Battagram district, the district president of the traders’ union, Abdul Ghaffar Deshani, lamented that businesses had been devastated by the government’s harsh policies, exorbitant taxes, and “weekly increases in the electricity rates”.      He claimed the government was favouring a particular class, alleging that it facilitated only those in Punjab as its “leadership tilt” there. Deshani warned of traders commencing a movement against the government for its “failed policies and day-to-day inflation” if it did not accept their demands. The union president emphasised that record inflation in the country had destroyed the economy, industries, and small businesses, impacting labourers. Noting that many traders had lost their businesses due to inflationary pressure, Deshani said they had “lost strength” when it came to carrying on with their businesses. He asked that the government “take emergency corrective measures” to improve the economy, considering that the “continued free fall of the rupee against the dollar snatched purchasing power from traders”. Shah Hussain, another trade leader from Battagram, said the bills had made the traders “hapless”.    Shops in KP’s Battagram district observe a shutter-down strike against tax reforms on Aug 28, 2024. — Photo via Humayun Baber  Traders had “no idea what to do and where to go” with local resources being depleted and revenue generation coming to a halt because of inflation, he said. Hussain censured the government for running on IMF directives, stating that political leaders had “no idea and plan to take the country [out of] the crisis”. Echoing Rahim’s statements, he pointed out that KP generated “7,500 megawatts” of electricity with the centre “buying it Rs2 per unit and selling it back to the people at Rs57”. Balochistan The Balochistan Anjuman-i-Tajraan (BAT) also rallied behind the countrywide calls for shutting down businesses today. The province is also reeling from the recent deadly attacks that claimed dozens of lives.    Traders in Quetta protest against tax reforms amid a shutter-down strike on Aug 28, 2024. — Photo via Abdullah Zehri    Shops in Quetta observe a shutter-down strike against tax reforms on Aug 28, 2024. — DawnNewsTV  Shops across Quetta — including Jinnah Road, Masjid Road, Liaquat Bazaar, Shahrah-i-Iqbal, Abdulsattar Road, Double Road and New Adda — remained closed as they took part in the strike. Traders in the city organised a rally against the reforms introducing heavy taxes and staged a protest outside the Quetta Press Club. BAT President Rahim Kakar and other traders addressed the gathering, terming the additional taxes “unacceptable”. According to a Dawn.com correspondent based in Quetta, traffic on the provincial capital’s roads was less than usual. ‘FBR willing to resolve issues, won’t withdraw scheme’ Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), had urged all its members to fully support Wednesday’s countrywide strike by closing their businesses. Muhammad Kamran Arbi, president of the Site Association of Industry, has extended firm support to the traders’ strike. The Korangi Association of Trade and Industry and the Central Association of Tajran Pakistan have also announced their support. Traders’ representatives visited the FBR’s headquarters on Tuesday to express their discontent to the revenue board’s chief Rashid Mahmood and his team regarding the Tajir Dost Scheme, which was implemented in April, and the recently notified tax rates that took effect in August. FBR chief Mahmood told Dawn that the FBR is willing to resolve “legitimate issues” raised during the meeting. “We are ready to make amendments to the SRO to address their concerns,” he said.      However, he emphasised that the FBR will not withdraw the Tajir Dost Scheme, which aims to bring the retail sector under the tax net. The FBR chief hinted at setting up a market-level review mechanism with representation from tax officers and traders to ensure that no shopkeepers face unfair tax rates. “We can rectify such issues by making amendments to the SRO.” Under the scheme, tax rates will be collected from shopkeepers in 42 cities across the country at a fixed rate of Rs100 to Rs20,000 per month, based on the fair market value of their stores.

  "description": "A truck driver, who rescuers initially thought was dead, was recovering on Tuesday after hospital staff receiving bodies realised he was alive despite being shot five times in one of the most widespread attacks in Balochistan in years. On Monday, Munir Ahmed was driving with three colleagues in a convoy of four trucks through Balochistan. The drivers did not notice anything amiss and had not heard of any violence until they were about an hour outside of Quetta. Suddenly, armed men crowded the dusty stretch of highway, waving at them to stop, ordering the drivers out of their trucks and lining them up on the roadside. Ahmed, 50, began to recite Quranic verses in fear. “We were all horrified,” he said. The gunmen opened fire and threw the men’s bodies into a stream, leaving them for dead.      Meanwhile, attackers along other roads were stopping buses, pulling off passengers, and killing men in front of their families, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti later said. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a banned militant group seeking secession from the resource-rich province bordering Iran and Afghanistan, took responsibility for the assaults.      Authorities said at least 70 people were killed in the attacks and subsequent military operations, including 23 civilians pulled out of their vehicles. Rescuers put Ahmed and the lifeless bodies of his three colleagues into a vehicle to take to the hospital, where medical staff realised he had survived. A nurse said he had been hit by five bullets in the arm and back but was in stable condition. Lying flat in a hospital bed, far from home in Punjab with his arm heavily bandaged, Ahmed said his memory of the attack was hazy and he was upset by his colleagues’ deaths, uncertain what would happen next after such a violent disruption to his livelihood.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Over 41 per cent of women in Pakistan suffer from anaemia, with 14.4pc being underweight and 24pc overweight, according to a new report. The state of maternal nutrition is so bleak that 186 women die per 100,000 live births; suboptimal breastfeeding leads to 2,000 dea­ths in mothers due to breast and ovarian cancer and 1,100 deaths due to type-II diabetes annually. Moreover, there are 1.4 million cases of low birth weight in Pakistan each year. This has been revealed in the ‘Cost of Inaction Tool’ developed by Nutrition International. The re­­port was presented at the ‘Nat­ional Policy Dialogue on Economic Case for Maternal Nutrition’, org­anised by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) in Bhurban.  Report says country loses $17bn every year due to under-nutrition  There are 918,154 new cases of anaemia among pregnant women and adolescent girls (15 to 49) every year. Pakistan has the fourth highest prevalence of anaemia in adolescent girls and women in eight South Asian countries and the 35th highest in the 201 countries worldwide. Nutrition International stated Pakistan loses at least $17bn every year — equivalent to 1pc of global income — due to undernutrition. The cost of low breastfeeding in Pakistan is $28bn as the country reports 6.9m cases of diarrhoea, 19,000 cases of child obesity, 30,525 child deaths (due to diarrhoea and pneumonia), 3,196 ma­­ternal deaths (due to breast and ovarian cancer and Type II diabetes). The declaration was endorsed by the federal health ministry; health departments of the four provinces, GB and AJK; and other stakeholders, including WHO, Unicef, WFP and others. ‘Bhurban declaration’ During the event, the federal government also signed the ‘Bhurban Declaration’ with the stakeholders. It pledges to accelerate the implementation of ‘Pakis­tan Maternal Nutrition Strategy 2022-27’ through a unified maternal nutrition package from preconception to postpartum care. It commits to integrating maternal nutrition into existing health services and universal health coverage frameworks, increasing pub­­­lic funding for maternal nutrition programmes and strengthening response mechanisms for addressing women’s nu­­tritional needs during emergencies. “The current maternal nutrition indicators underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition”, said Dr Fouzia Hanif, the deputy director of Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Adolescent Health and Nutrition at the federal health ministry. Emphasising the critical role of maternal health in the overall development of society, she called for coordinated efforts from all stakeholders to develop a holistic approach built on Pakistan Costed Multi-Sectoral National Nutrition Action Plan 2023-2030. She expressed hope that the declaration will serve as a powerful testament to making sustained progress towards advancing maternal nutrition in Pakistan. Nutrition Interna­tional official Dr Irfanullah said: “Our efforts focus on providing essential micronutrient supplementation, strengthening the capacity of healthcare providers, and ensuring quality care for positive pregnancy outcomes and safe births”.

  "description": "• Law enforcement thwarts attempt to block key highway • Three bullet-riddled bodies found in Nasirabad • Six militants’ bodies shifted to Quetta for identification • Truck driver thought dead in attack recovers in hospital DERA MURAD JAMALI / QUETTA: The situation in Balochistan remained tense on Tuesday, a day after militants launched coordinated attacks that left dozens dead in one of the worst waves of violence in the province’s history. Security forces hunted the militants responsible for the deadly assaults, including pulling passengers off buses before killing them, blowing up a key railway bridge and storming a hotel. At midnight between Sunday and Monday, militants took control of a highway and shot dead 23 people, mostly labourers from Punjab, and attacked the hotel and the railway bridge connecting Balochistan to the rest of the country. The sites hit were cordoned off Tuesday as the search for assailants went on. “But no arrests have been made so far, and no additional militants have been killed,” provincial government spokesman Shahid Rind said. Monday’s death toll includes 35 civilians and 14 members of the security forces, while the military said troops killed 21 militants. Situation remains tense As the province grapples with the aftermath, authorities on Tuesday discovered three more bullet-riddled bodies in Nasirabad district, while law enforcement agencies foiled an attempt to block the Quetta-Karachi National Highway in Khadkocha. “All three individuals were killed by gunshots to the head and other parts of the body, leading to their deaths,” police said, quoting hospital officials.      A pistol, spent bullet casings and a motorcycle were recovered from the scene. The faces of two of the victims were covered and the bodies have yet to be identified. Further investigation was ongoing. Separately, the bodies of six militants were shifted to Civil Hospital Quetta for identification. “We have received six bodies for autopsy and identification,” said Police Surgeon Dr Ayesha Faiz, noting that their identities had yet to be determined. Meanwhile, unknown armed motorcyclists opened fire at two people near Javed Complex in the Gormakan area of Panjgur, killing one of them on the spot and injuring the other. In another firing incident, two people were injured in the Khuda-i-Abdan area of Panjgur town. All victims were shifted to a district hospital. The deceased was identified as Sajjad Ali, while the injured included Irfan, Abdul Wahab and Sajid. Besides, Levies said that armed men barged into a house and took a man away with them at gunpoint. After 20 minutes, the man’s bullet-riddled body was found in Keshnak area. In another firing incident in the Buleda area of the Kech district, armed men kidnapped a man and killed him in the Grank area. Truck driver survives Meanwhile, a truck driver, who rescuers initially thought was dead, was recovering on Tuesday after hospital staff receiving bodies realised he was alive despite being shot five times by militants. The driver, Munir Ahmed, recounted how he and his colleagues were ambushed on the highway by armed men who forced them out of their vehicles and shot them before leaving their bodies in a stream. A nurse said Mr Ahmed had been hit by five bullets in the arm and back but was in stable condition. Bridge being restored The railway bridge in Bolan, a key link between Balochistan and the rest of the country, lay in ruins on Tuesday after explosives were used to destroy it, halting train services and leaving the area littered with debris. Railway officials are working to clear the road and restore the bridge. “Explosives were used to attack our main bridge routes yesterday, which has stopped trains from travelling to other parts of the country,” Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway official in Balochistan, told AFP. “We are working to clear the road as quickly as possible to ease traffic for the public,” he said.

  "description": "PESHAWAR: The signs of infighting within the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter are growing as two senior office-bearers have been sacked with the approval of provincial president of the party and Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. The removal of PTI president for Peshawar region MNA Mohammad Atif Khan and president for Peshawar district MNA Sher Ali Arbab comes 10 days after the de-notification of communication and works minister Shakeel Khan over alleged corruption. These three PTI leaders are reportedly part of a group opposing Mr Gandapur. PTI general secretary in the province Ali Asghar Khan notified the elevation of PTI Peshawar district general secretary Mohammad Asim Khan as the new regional president and additional general secretary Irfan Saleem as the district president.  Removal of MNAs Atif Khan and Sher Ali comes with CM Gandapur’s consent  He also issued a notification of the appointment of Shahab Khan as the new general secretary of PTI’s Peshawar district. The Peshawar region comprises Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s central districts, including Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi and Nowshera. Conflicts in the PTI and its provincial government surfaced when party founder Imran Khan sent a stern message from his jail cell to members of his party’s government that they all would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. The message was made public by the then provincial minister for communication and works department, Shakeel Khan, during a news conference at the Peshawar Press Club on August 3. “He (Imran Khan) had information that all is not well in some departments, so he asked us to deliver a clear-cut message to cabinet members, administrative secretaries and other government officials that they will be held responsible for any corruption, commission and irregularities in their departments,” Mr Shakeel said after meeting Mr Imran along with other party leaders in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. Sources in the PTI claimed that the provincial government was not happy with the way Imran Khan’s message was delivered to the cabinet by one of its members. They added that apparently, Mr Shakeel was punished through the August 17 de-notification as a minister amid growing PTI infighting over alleged corruption and irregularities in top echelons of the province’s leadership. However, the former minister claimed to have quit the cabinet, with his “resignation letter” starting to circulate on social media platforms around midnight. However, the provincial government insisted that the communication minister be removed on the recommendation of a three-member accountability committee formed by the chief minister on the orders of Mr Imran. Mr Atif later uploaded a message in favour of Mr Shakeel from his account on X (formerly Twitter), declaring him an honest person. “I have worked in the cabinet with Shakeel Ahmad for ten years and have never seen a more honest minister than him. He (Shakeel) pointed out the corruption in KP cabinet when asked by Imran Khan in jail. A conspiracy was hatched against Shakeel Khan. Two conspirators will be exposed when the time comes,” he tweeted. Sources in the PTI claimed that some central leaders of the party, including former president Arif Alvi, had requested the sacked minister and office-bearers not to issue any statement that could fuel party differences. They added that those leaders believed that the growing rifts in the ruling party would badly affect the movement for the release of Mr Imran and plans for a public rally in Islamabad on Sept 8.

  "description": "• Shehbaz says all resources at army’s disposal to uproot menace; states militants want to stop uplift through CPEC • Cabinet backs ECC’s decision to approve Rs60bn for Azm-i-Istehkam operation • Dar describes dialogue with TTP as a ‘big blunder’ • Senators discuss National Action Plan ISLAMABAD: A day after at least 50 people lost their lives in militant attacks across Balochistan, the government reiterated the resolve to “uproot” terrorism while keeping the door of dialogue open for those willing to abide by the Constitution. Separately, senators called for across-the-board consensus on a strategy to deal with the threat of terrorism. Addressing the federal cabinet on Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the armed forces would be provided with all resources to root out terrorism at all costs. “We have told the armed forces of Pakistan that whatever resources they need would be provided by cutting down other expenditures. There would be no shortage of funds,” said the PM. The cabinet endorsed the decision of its Econo­mic Coordination Commi­ttee (ECC) to approve Rs60 billion for Operation Azm-i-Istehkam. The initial disbursement of Rs20bn in the first phase would be immediately released, with the remaining funds to be released on a need-to-need basis. The PM said the “time for wiping out terrorism has come”, adding that it is the “unwavering resolve” of the army chief to end terrorism at all costs. “There are no two opinions. The entire nation is unanimous about this.” At the same time, the prime minister said doors for dialogue “were open and would remain open” for those who believe in Pakistan and “respect its national flag and the Constitution”. “However, there would be no talks with the enemies and terrorists, nor any clemency.” ‘TTP operating out of Afghanistan’ The PM said it is no longer a secret that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was operating from Afghanistan. Pakistan had informed the Afghan government of its concerns and conducted effective operations against terrorists, he added. He said the only objective of the ongoing wave of terrorism in Balochistan was to “create anarchy in the country” and “hamper the progress”. “They want to disrupt the development of Balochistan and other parts of the country through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,” the prime minister said, while referring to the terrorists’ intentions. The PM said he would soon visit Balochistan and hold detailed consultations for immediate actions on the ground. “We have to move forward with complete determination. There is no space for any kind of weakness. There is no question of debility.” Another olive branch On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar while speaking in the Senate offered the “disgruntled Baloch separatists” to hold talks with the government but made it clear that “violence in the name of anger” was not acceptable. He said political consensus was crucial to deal with economic and security challenges. He urged political forces to “sit together and find a practical way forward to eliminate terrorism and bring about economic stability”. Responding to various points raised by the senators, Mr Dar said dialogues should be held with those who “believe in Pakistan”. The elements involved in “creating chaos and killing innocent people in the name of estrangement” should be condemned by all. He said the terrorists were “playing in the hands of Pakistan’s enemies” to create instability. According to Mr Dar, parliament must collectively determine a way forward to overcome the prevailing unrest in Balochistan, and the government will implement those decisions. He said state had collectively decided to launch the operations Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad to counter terrorism after the Army Public School attack in 2014. As a result, the law and order situation improved, but in the recent past, terrorists were brought back and released from jails, the deputy PM claimed. He said talks with the banned TTP were a “big blunder” and underlined the need to set aside politics in matters of national interest. Earlier, Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz said his party believed political issues should be resolved politically and the use of force should be the last resort. Expressing concern over the terrorist attacks, he said the “nation wants to know what was happening”. He said law and order was linked with economic development and a government “lacking legitimacy and public support” cannot bring positive change. PPP Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the attacks and called for more parliamentary oversight on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP). She said there was no such thing as a “good terrorist” or a “bad terrorist”. “A terrorist is unmistakably a terrorist. Anyone who takes up arms in any country is deemed a terrorist. Let there be no confusion on this matter.” “The country has conducted successful counter-terrorism operations … There is no need to reinvent the wheel. However, parliament should exercise oversight to ensure the effective implementation of NAP,” Ms Rehman said. ANP President Aimal Wali Khan said terms and conditions for the resettlement of 40,000 terrorists should be made public. He sought an inquiry against former generals Qamar Javed Bajwa and Faiz Hameed, former president Arif Alvi and ex-KP CM Mahmood Khan to ask them about the resettlement of terrorists. PML-N leader Senator Irfan Siddiqui, in his speech, asked how many points of the NAP have been implemented in the last ten years. He also called for a collective strategy and emphasised the door for dialogue “should be shut”. According to Mr Siddiqui, the enemies of Pakistan were providing money and weapons to terrorists.

  "description": "• Fazl asks party workers to ensure success of strike • Naeem vows to pressure govt into providing relief LAHORE: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday announced support for the nationwide shutter-down strike called by Jamaat-i-Islami for Wednesday (today), and asked party workers to ensure its success. Presiding over a preparatory meeting for a Khatm-i-Nabuwat (PBUH) conference, Maulana Fazl said the government has made life increasingly difficult for the common man. Price hikes and taxation reached unbearable levels, he lamented, attributing these to the dictates of the Inter­na­tional Monetary Fund (IMF). “JUI-F fully supports the strike call and workers and business forums of the party should not only participate in it but also make this peaceful strike a success,” he declared. Later, Maulana Fazl visited the residence of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain to inquire about his health. According to a party press release, the two leaders held discussions on the current political and economic situation in the country. Earlier, JI emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said Wednesday’s nationwide shutter-down strike will be a decisive move to pressure the government into providing relief to traders and the general public. Talking to the media during a visit to the party’s Hall Road camp, Mr Rehman urged traders to remain united as solidarity is vital for protecting both their rights and those of the public. He reiterated his commitment to holding the government accountable for the agreement reached following their 14-day sit-in protest. The JI set up the Hall Road camp as a hub to mobilise traders and the general public in support of the strike. During his visit, Mr Rehman met representatives of various trader organisations, who pledged their full support for the JI’s call for a nationwide strike. The JI emir slammed the government’s newly proposed “trader-friendly [tajir dost]” scheme, branding it as detrimental to traders. He said the government’s plan to impose taxes based on market assessments, rather than fair, income-based taxation, is unjust and unacceptable. Although traders are willing to contribute to broadening the tax base, they strongly reject what they perceive as an unfair and inequitable scheme. He called upon the ruling elite to rein in their lavish spending and impose taxes on feudal lords to boost revenue for the exchequer. He said the JI has already proposed measures to revitalise the economy and safeguard the interests of traders and the public. However, he regretted, the government is reluctant to make necessary decisions, and continued to burden the already struggling poor, salaried class, and business community. To advocate for public relief, Mr Rehman stressed the importance of a peaceful resistance movement, prompting the JI to announce the strike after consultations with traders. He hinted that JI would reveal its future plans after further discussions with traders, possibly announcing more strikes if the government remains unresponsive. The JI chief also threw down a challenge to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, asking him to disclose the extent of the Sharif family’s benefits from the national exchequer through capacity charges on their independent power plants (IPPs). He lambasted Mr Sharif for portraying himself as a savior by offering what he described as token relief to the people of Punjab amidst soaring power tariffs. He claimed that the entire country could enjoy reduced electricity costs if the Sharif family and their associates waived the capacity charges they receive from their IPPs. Mr Rehman reiterated JI’s demand for a countrywide reduction in electricity tariffs and demanded a forensic audit of the IPPs. He appealed to the public to actively participate in making the strike a success. The JI emir condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan, denouncing those who target innocent people based on ethnicity as agents of foreign agendas seeking to destabilise Pakistan. He demanded stringent action against such elements with the involvement of Balochistan’s genuine leadership, and stressed that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday reserved verdict on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s plea for halting the hearing in the intra-party polls case until the Supreme Court’s clarification comes with regard to its majority judgement in the reserved seats case. A three-member bench of the ECP, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, heard the case. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, advocate Ayesha Khalid and advocate Uzair Bhandari appeared before the bench. Barrister Gohar referred to the FIA’s raid at the PTI’s office and seizure of the party record. He said the FIA officials even took away the water dispenser. He, however, said that the record can be obtained from the FIA, if the ECP issues directions.  Lawyer contends ECP cannot decide on the validity of intra-party elections  Lawyer Bhandari argued that the ECP has sent a questionnaire and the first question is about the current status of PTI. “The answer to this question has come in the Supreme Court’s short order in the reserved seats case,” he said. He stressed that the detailed verdict of the top court should be awaited while the Election Commission has asked the Supreme Court for an explanation regarding the reserved seats. To this, member of ECP from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said, “We have not made any request to the Supreme Court regarding the PTI’s new intra-party elections; we have asked the Supreme Court that whose party certificates should be recognised until the intra-party elections are recognised”. In response, Barrister Khan explained that he had issued certificates to the 39 members whom the ECP had recognised as PTI’s. “We did not accept the certificates but acted on the Supreme Court order,” the ECP member contended. The lawyer emphasised that the Supreme Court verdict is before the Election Commission, and the ECP cannot decide on the validity of the intra-party elections. To this, member of ECP from Sindh inquired ‘what do you want now’ and the lawyer replied that they want the Election Commission not to hear the case till the clarification or detailed decision of the Supreme Court regarding the reserved seats is announced. The PTI also challenged the ECP’s jurisdiction over intra-party elections, as its lawyer, Mr Bhandari, said that scrutiny of intra-party elections does not fall in the jurisdiction of the ECP, saying the electoral watchdog can only see whether the intra-party elections were held or not. He said the commission should first decide its jurisdiction. DG Law said the Supreme Court in its short order had said that party certificates of only 41 independent members should be submitted, the Supreme Court has not mentioned any specific party, as an independent member can join any political party. The ECP has asked the Supreme Court to clarify whose certificate should be accepted for joining the PTI, concerning 41 members. The ECP, later djourned the hearing of the case till September 18, reserving its verdict on the request of PTI to keep the case pending till the clarification comes from the top court in its detailed verdict. Speaking to reporters after the hearing of the case, Barrister Khan said they had submitted documents with the ECP on March 8 after the third intra-party elections, but till date they have not received the certificate. He said the PTI is a political party and people are with the ideology of fou­nder of PTI Imran Khan. “We don’t need any symbol. We will make a clean sweep by participating fully in the local government elections of Islamabad, whereas the government is trying to postpone these elections,” he said.

  "content": "KARACHI: Citing new details from ongoing probe into Karsaz road accident, Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho on Wednesday revealed that investigations suggest that the suspect should not have been driving the vehicle.  Talking to media, Odho said he doesn’t want to divulge into the details as investigation into the accident — that killed two people and left at least three others injured — was underway. “A final opinion could only be made after holding consultation with medical authorities,\" he said, adding that the police will also take medical experts on board in this regard. Earlier, Inspector General of Sindh Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon decided to form a special investigation team to probe the Karsaz road accident case. The IGP said an officer of senior superintendent of police (SSP) rank would work with the investigation team, as they were taking it as a high-profile case. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on August 19. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was reportedly in critical condition. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. As per the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on the phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the SUV driver hit his brother’s bike from the rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving license, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. They said that charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR."

  "content": "KARACHI: Amid ongoing moderate to heavy rainfall in Karachi, the provincial authorities were alerted to take precautionary measures as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted more torrential rain in the province in the wake of a deep depression system expected to move southwest. The port city continued to witness intermittent showers throughout today with the highest rainfall – recorded between 8am to 5pm – was 20 millimetres in Nazimabad. According to the statistics shared by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), 16.5mm of rain was recorded in Kemari, 13mm in Gulshan-e-Hadeed, 11.5mm in Quaidabad, 9.5mm in Orangi Town, 8.5mm at Old Airport and University Road, 8mm in Saddar, 7mm at Sharea Faisal, 6mm in Maripur and Jinnah Terminal. Other areas, including Gulshan-e-Maymar, Korangi, Tariq Road, Liaquatabad, Model Colony and Gurumandir, also experienced significant rainfall, leading to water accumulation on roads. Speaking to Geo News, Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz forecasted up to 200mm of rain in Karachi and 300mm in other cities of the province from August 29 to August 31.    He pointed out that a low-pressure system was currently present at Tharparkar’s South — which according to him may head towards the southwest and cause heavy downpours with strong winds in the metropolis and other cities, including Sajawal and Thatta, tomorrow. “Karachi may receive 150 to 200mm rain in the next two to three days,” Sarfaraz said. The PMD chief mentioned that wind thunderstorms were also expected with scattered heavy to isolated very heavy falls during this time. On the other hand, the Met Office – in a statement said – a deep depression currently located over Nagarparkar and adjoining coastal areas of Sindh, which is likely to move west/southwest during the next 24 hours. “Due to this weather system, strong monsoon currents are penetrating in the country (especially southern parts),” it said, adding a westerly wave was also likely to affect upper parts of the country from tomorrow. The meteorological department warned that torrential rains may generate pluvial flood/inundation in low-lying parts of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. Torrential rains may also generate flash flooding in hill torrents of DG Khan and local nullahs/streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbella. Meanwhile, the Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh, Syed Salman Shah urged the public to stay informed through official channels and adhere to safety precautions during current heavy rainfall. The downpour is likely to affect areas near Karachi and Badin, posing a risk of flash flooding and urban flooding in low-lying areas, he said while speaking to a private news channel. Shah said that the disaster management authority was reviewing arrangements and taking significant steps to manage the ongoing rainfall in the province. In a bid to mitigate the impact of the heavy downpour, the PDMA was providing dewatering pumps to various district administrations and municipal corporations. Additionally, the PDMA is working closely with district authorities to identify vulnerable areas and take proactive measures to protect lives and property, he added. The authority is also coordinating with emergency services, including rescue teams and medical personnel, to ensure a swift response to any emergencies that may arise, he mentioned. By taking proactive measures, the authority aims to reduce the risk of flooding and ensure a safe and secure environment for the people of Sindh, he added. Meanwhile, the Sindh Education Department has delegated the authority of school closure to respective Deputy Commissioners (DCs) owing to heavy rain and flooding. In a letter to all DCs in the province, the department noted that a monsoon season was underway in various districts and the “same is expected to prevail for few more days.” Given the intensity of heavy rains and damages in respective districts, the letter said, the deputy commissioners can announce local holidays in schools. Later, deputy commissioners of Hyderabad, Badin and Sujawal announced holiday for all private and public educational institutions tomorrow (Thursday) in light of monsoon rains.  Meanwhile, the Mirpurkhas DC announced all educational institutions in the district will remain closed for two days.  Moreover, Nawabshah and Jamshoro DCs announced holiday for all private and public educational institutions for three days due to monsoon rains.  With additional input from APP"

  "content": "In light of recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan, independent Senator and former caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar has called out for all-out support for the country's security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in what he terms a \"national war\" against terrorism. \"This is a national war and not an isolated fight of the Frontier Corps, Pakistan Army, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Military Intelligence (MI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB),\" Senator Kakar said while speaking during the Senate session on Tuesday. His remarks come against the backdrop of recent attacks in Balochistan which saw over two dozen people, including security personnel, being martyred. On Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were martyred in clearance operations — launched after at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorist incidents — wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Addressing the Upper House, Senator Kakar said that the prerogative over violence only rested with the state. However, he added, an attempt was being made to \"create a gap between institutions\" that have been made responsible for violence management by the Constitution. \"The beginning of the victory in this war starts with accepting them [security forces, LEAs] as the protector of our home, locality, province and country,\" he said. Furthermore, he underscored that all necessary assistance, whether on the legal front via the promulgation of necessary laws or on the financial front, all-out support to the security forces and the LEAs including the provision of equipment, narrative building etc. \"This is a war based on a multi-prong strategy,\" the senator noted. Continuing on the terrorists' nefarious objectives, Kakar said that the militants target whoever is standing with the state of Pakistan whether it is the Baloch, Pashtoon or anyone else. Commenting on Baloch terrorist outfits, he noted that their narrative wasn't that they were deprived of their rights, but in fact, they claim their separate identity alleging us of occupying their land and that they wanted to break Pakistan and establish another state of their own. \"Who are they [terrorists]? They are a mere 1% [of the masses] if they were not and they had the support of a large section of Baloch society then they would come to the ballot and not resort to armed struggle,\" the lawmaker stressed, adding that the militants were targeting the country's resolve targeting so that we give up this fight. On the issue of negotiations with the terrorists, Kakar said that dialogue was a mere tool for the end goal which needs to be defined. Censuring the ones who misled the country regarding holding talks with the militants, he said: \"Who were they ones who misled and deceived the people of this country over the delusion of negotiations [...] we believed them to have informed opinion but they misled the parliament\". Highlighting the need to address the internal confusion, he called for leaving aside all political differences and for a uniform effort to carve a way forward including a serious debate regarding the use of force, negotiations as other matters."

  "content": "The life expectancy of Pakistanis is being adversely impacted due to the country's poor air quality, revealed the Annual Air Quality Index (AQLI) report produced by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC). According to the report, the country's worsening air pollution is limiting the number of years that people live in Pakistan. The report said that Pakistanis — as part of South Asia, the world's most polluted region — are exposed to particulate pollution levels that are 22.3% higher than that experienced at the turn of the century. It maintained that the entire population of Pakistan breathes air that doesn't meet the PM2.5 standard set at 15 µg/m³, people's life expectancy could be increased by 2.3 years if the country is able to meet its own PM2.5 standard. \"In Pakistan, where the PM2.5 concentration was 38.9 µg/m³ in 2022 — 10% lower compared to the particulate levels in 2021, the average resident would gain 3.3 years from meeting the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline,\" read the AQLI 2024 annual update. \"Those in Peshawar, the most polluted city in the country, would gain 5.6 years,\" it added.  Elaborating on the increase in factors affecting air pollution, the AQLI underscored an approximately fourfold increase in the number of vehicles in the country since the early 2000s as well as a significant increase in the use of fossil fuel for electricity generation. Noting that 94 out of 252 countries and territories globally had national standards, making up 80% of the world's population, it highlighted that 37 of those countries weren't meeting them — which amounts to 30%of the world's population. Terming global pollution as the \"greatest external threat to human life expectancy\", the report stated that people in the most polluted areas of the world breathe air that is six times more polluted than those in the least polluted areas, which in return, reduces their life expectancy is reduced by an average of 2.7 years compared to those living in the cleanest places."

  "content": "Traders all over the country observe a nationwide strike on Wednesday to protest against the government's tax reforms and the rising cost of electricity. Political parties such as the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Awami National Party (ANP) have extended their support to the traders, endorsing the strike across the country. In Karachi, the Anjuman-e-Tajiran Karachi had announced a complete closure of business today ahead of the strike. \"The political leadership has failed,\" said Javed Shams, the president of the All Pakistan Anjuman-e-Tajiran's Sindh chapter, announcing his support for the nationwide strike. Shams added that all business will be completely closed today in all small and big cities of Sindh. \"[We] reject the hike in taxes and electricity bills.\" He added that the ruling class wants to take away the right to live from the business class and the people, insisting that the \"Trader Friendly Scheme\" is not acceptable in its current form. The Karachi Electronics Dealers Association has also backed the strike call. KEDA President Mohammad Rizwan said all trade unions from Karachi to Khyber are participating in the strike. \"If the issues are not resolved, the duration of the strike may increase,\" said Rizwan. All Karachi Traders Union President Atiq Mir termed the strike as one of the citizens and not traders. \"The common man is worried about inflation.\" Reacting to the countrywide strike, Coordinator to Prime Minister of Pakistan on Implementation and Monitoring, Rana Ihsaan Afzal Khan, said the government will not be pressured by traders. Speaking during Geo News programme \"Geo Pakistan\", Khan invited the traders for talks if they considered the government’s “wrong”. He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reorganised the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), insisting that the retail sector must also come under the tax net. Traders across cities in Sindh — including Nawabshah, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Sajawal, and others — are also striking with central commercial areas as well as small- and large-scale businesses shut in adhere with the strike. \"Monthly tax, withholding tax, professional tax are anti-business policies,\" said Sindh Traders Association President Waqar Memon. Meanwhile in Punjab, cities including Vehari, all business centres are closed following the call of nationwide strike by the Central Traders Association of Pakistan with all markets including those at the Club Road, Jinnah Road, Luddun Road, Rail Bazaar, Choori Bazar and Multan Road completely closed. The president of the association, supporting the call, said that the government has imposed \"cruel taxes\" on the traders. In Gujranwala, all small and major markets in the cities' inner parts including Cloth Market, Steel Market and Sanitary Market, as well as those in the Satellite Town will be closed. The city's mobile phone association has also endorsed the call for strike. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar, traders' organisations are observing the strike, as various markets remain shut across the city with trade unions demanding the withdrawal of the hike in power bills and reduction in tax rates. All markets including Sadar Bazaar, Shafi Market, Qisa Khwani and Khyber Bazaar have been shut, while traders organisations have set up protest camps in front of the closed markets. In Dera Ismail Khan, traders are observing a complete strike with all commercial centers closed following support from traders' association, traders' union and traders' action committee. Markets and commercial centres in Punjab cities including Chichawatani are closed following the strike with traders demanding the government to withdraw \"cruel\" taxes and reduction in electricity cost. On the other hand, JI in Charsadda have also called for the traders' strike, as all food shops including hotels remain closed. Addressing a presser in Karachi today, JI Spokesperson Qaisar Sharif said that all traders and industrialists support the party’s call for a strike. \"The public has rejected the government's attempts to stop the strike. If the problems are not resolved, a future action plan will be presented after consultation with traders and industrial organisations,\" the spokesperson added. Qaisar insisted that the government end the unfair contracts with IPPs and immediately implement the agreement made with JI. \"Jamaat-e-Islami will not back down from its demands without providing relief to the people.\" In Lahore, JI and traders’ organisations are observing the strike as most markets and businesses of the city remain closed for the day. All small and big markets as well as shops including bakeries, ovens, hotels, general stores also remain shut on the appeal of traders in Rawalpindi, where the business community and trade associations including the city’s Oil Tanker Association have extended their support for the strike. A strike was also observed in other cities of Punjab such as Rahim Yar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Cheechawatani, Sargodha, Choonian, Taxila, Chakwal, Patoki, Changa Manga and Arifwala. In Balochistan, too, traders have kept their shops and business closed in protest across cities including Quetta, Hub, Harnai and Mastung, among others. Other KP cities observing the strike include Mansehra, Bajaur, Charsadda, Kirk, Bannu and Malakand. Earlier this week, the religio-political party had announced to observe a shutter-down strike across the country on August 28 (today) to mount pressure on the coalition government to provide relief to the masses. The announcement came after the party postponed its 14-day long sit-in on August 9 following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with the Independent Power Producers which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that the country cannot afford that the bureaucracy and the elite enjoying luxuries at the expenses paid in taxes by the poor as the federal cabinet greenlighted the continuation of austerity drive. \"In view of the larger national interests, all ministries and institutions should take all possible decisions and initiatives that could save each penny of the nation,\" the premier said while chairing a meeting of the federal cabinet. He said that steps were being taken, on a priority basis, to further improve governance and bring about institutional reforms in the country. “We are introducing digitisation and smart management of institutions to modernise the country’s system and harmonise it in accordance with the international requirements,” PM Shehbaz said. He also appreciated the decisions taken by the finance minister, minister for national food security, minister for energy and other relevant ministers and officials for ensuring uninterrupted supply of urea fertiliser for the upcoming Rabi crop. An amount of $130 million was saved in the national exchequer by halting the import of urea and by ensuring uninterrupted gas supply to urea fertilizer units for the upcoming Rabi crop. On the recommendations of the Ministry of Housing and Works, proposals were presented in the federal cabinet regarding the dissolution of Pakistan Public Works Department (PWD), transfer of its staff and ongoing projects to other ministries and institutions. The meeting was informed that on the directions of the prime minister, necessary maintenance staff and inquiries were being handed over to the ministries concerned and provincial governments to continue uninterrupted work on the ongoing development and PSDP projects tasked to PWD. In this regard, the federal cabinet approved the recommendations of the Ministry of Housing and Works. The cabinet was presented with the recommendations of the Rightsizing of the Federal Government Committee set up for Institutional Reforms, headed by the finance minister. The cabinet was informed that in order to improve the performance of the federal government, proper use of manpower, removal of unnecessary impediments in the policy-making and implementation of decisions, and to further strengthen the most important departments and bodies, the first phase of work on committee’s recommendations about six ministries had already been initiated. The meeting was further informed that in the light of the recommendations of the committee, a total of 82 government bodies related to these ministries were being merged and dissolved into 40 such institutions, in which digitisation, smart management, efficient governance, transparent and speedy implementation of projects and better provision of facilities to the common man would be ensured. The federal cabinet also approved the recommendations of the committee and set up a committee to ensure the protection of the interests of the employees who were expected to be affected by the merger and dissolution of these entities. The meeting was given a detailed briefing on the progress on the ongoing austerity drive and implementation of measures under the prime minister’s vision and directives to reduce government expenditure. The federal cabinet nodded for the continuation of the austerity drive approved by the cabinet under the leadership of PM Shehbaz during the previous tenure of his government. These measures included voluntary non-withdrawal of salaries by the cabinet members, ban on purchase of government vehicles other than essential vehicles such as ambulances, ban on purchase of new equipment and machinery, creation of new government posts, non-essential foreign travel at the government expenses and ban on treatment abroad. The prime minister urged the ministers to ensure that austerity measures were being implemented in their relevant ministries and institutions. He also lauded their efforts in ensuring implementation of austerity measures. The cabinet also endorsed the decisions taken in the meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) held on August 22, 2024."

In recognition of his meritorious services, rendered towards enhancing defence cooperation with Pakistan, the president conferred the award on the Chinese general.  Over a career spanning more than forty years, he has made significant contributions to the Chinese military through his diligence, determination, and effectiveness. His steadfast loyalty, exemplary leadership, initiative, and vision earned him widespread admiration and motivated others to reach for the highest levels of accomplishment. Earlier on Monday, Commander Li expressed admiration for Pakistan’s concerted efforts in combating terrorism and extremism during a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarter in Rawalpindi, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. Moreover, during their meeting, the army chief underscored the robust relations between the Pakistan Army and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting the ongoing bilateral military cooperation is a testament to the enduring brotherhood between the two nations, as per the ISPR. PM Shehbaz also warmly welcomed General Li to Pakistan and underscored that Pakistan and China are All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners and trusted friends. Notably, during his decades of service to the nation, General Li has been recognised for his exceptional professionalism, remarkable command skills, and dedicated efforts in promoting peace and stability both within China and globally. As a close ally of Pakistan, he has significantly contributed to strengthening Pakistan-China military relations through his steadfast commitment and dedication.

  "content": "A day after a series of deadly attacks in Balochistan rattled the nation, the United States and China, two of Pakistan's key allies, have reiterated their strong support for Pakistan in its fight against terrorism. A spate of deadly attacks in the southwestern province left more than 50 dead, including civilians, police, and military personnel in a single day. The bloodbath drew widespread concern and condemnations from the government and foreign countries. Decrying the militant attacks, Pakistan's long-time regional ally China extended its support and expressed deep grief over the attacks in the southwestern resource-rich province, which is also home to major China-led projects such as a port and a gold and copper mine. Vowing to continue its unwavering support to the country in its fight against terrorism, Beijing has strongly denounced the recent attacks. \"China stands firm against all forms of terrorism. We will continue giving staunch support to Pakistan in its effort to advance counter-terrorism operations, uphold social solidarity and stability, and protect the safety of the people,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said in a press briefing on Tuesday. He reaffirmed China's readiness to enhance counter-terrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan further and jointly safeguard peace and security in the region. Meanwhile, Washington has also mourned the loss of law enforcers and civilians in Musakhail and other regions of Balochistan. \"Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those killed in yesterday’s attacks. The United States will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism,\" the US embassy in Islamabad wrote on its official X account. Meanwhile, the European Union also deplored the heinous attacks in a statement. \"Terrorism and violence in any form have no place. They threaten the foundations of democracy. Our thoughts are with those affected [by] this senseless act,\" the EU Commission Spokesperson Nabila Massrali wrote on X. Moreover, Germany also extended support by showing solidarity with the attack victims and expressing concern about the \"recent surge in violence in Balochistan\" that resulted in loss of precious lives. \"Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims. We hope for a swift restoration of peace and stability in the region,\" the German Consul General in Karachi.  Monday saw a series of horrific attacks as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In response, security forces gunned down 21 terrorists and injured several others. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism.   — With additional input from Reuters"

X/@PTIofficial/FileISLAMABAD: Incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on Tuesday submitted separate bail petitions in an accountability court seeking their release in the new Toshakhana...",
  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on Tuesday submitted separate bail petitions in an accountability court seeking their release in the new Toshakhana case. Mentioning the state and chairman National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as parties to the case, both the applications filed through Barrister Salman Safdar under Section 9(b) of NA Ordinance 1999 and Section 497 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) request the accountability court to grant post-arrest bail to the couple in \"interest of justice and fair play\". The development comes as both Imran and Bushra are on judicial remand in Adiala jail over the Toshakhana reference filed by the anti-graft watchdog last week.   The duo was arrested in the said case on July 13 hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted them in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail before the filing of the new cases.    The reference — which consists of two volumes — was filed by NAB investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan in an accountability court. The fresh reference will now be reviewed by the registrar of the accountability courts. After removing the objections, the reference will be sent to the administrative judge of the accountability court. The administrative judge will then decide whether to conduct the hearing himself or transfer it to another accountability court. It should be noted that administrative Judge Nasir Javed Rana is already hearing the £190 million reference against the PTI founder. The new NAB reference pertains to a case related to a jewellery set gifted to former first lady Bushra by the Saudi crown prince when Imran was the prime minister of the country from 2018 to 2022.  The jewellery set — comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings — was gifted to the former first lady on her visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2021, as per the NAB's reference. It said the PTI founder and his wife have illegally kept the jewellery set. It added that the deputy military secretary briefed the Toshakhana section officer to estimate and declare the price of the jewellery set. The jewellery set, it mentioned, was not deposited in Toshakhana. The jewellery company sold the necklace for €300,000 and earrings for €80,000 on May 25, 2018. The information regarding the price of the bracelet and ring could not be obtained from the company. On May 28, 2021, the price of the jewellery set was estimated at Rs70.56 million; the price of the necklace was Rs50.64 million and the price of the earrings included in the jewellery valued at Rs10.50 million back then. According to the rules, the 50% price of the jewellery set is approximately Rs30.57 million.  The national exchequer suffered a loss of approximately Rs30.28 after the jewellery was undervalued.  As per the reference, the PTI founder and his wife violated the NAB Ordinance. It added that an inquiry was initiated against the former first couple on the instructions of the NAB chairman on August 1, 2022. \"[The] PTI founder and Bushra have misused their powers. [The] PTI founder retained 58 out of 108 gifts during his prime ministership,\" read the reference."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: At least four soldiers embraced martyrdom while 25 terrorists, including a ring leader, were killed in intelligence-based operations (IBOs) being conducted since August 20 in Tirah valley of Khyber district, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.   In a statement, the military’s media wing said the security forces were conducting “extensive IBOs” in Tirah valley against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) labelled as Fitna-Al-Khwarij and other militant groups Laskar-e-Islam and Jamat-ul-Ahrar. The ISPR noted that these operations were based on “robust intelligence and resulted into major setbacks to Fitna-Al-Khwarij and its affiliates”. During the intel-based operations, the security forces so far killed 25 terrorists, including a ring leader named Abuzar aka Saddam. “However, four soldiers, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom”, the ISPR added. “The heavy losses inflicted upon Fitna-Al-Khwarij in these operations is testament to the valor and commitment of security forces to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country,” it concluded. On Aug 25, terrorists attacked a check post in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Central Kurram, resulting in martyrdom of one policeman. Similarly, security forces killed seven terrorists and wounded five others during an IBO in the Kurram district earlier this month. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. A day earlier, Balochistan faced a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In response, security forces gunned down 21 terrorists and injured several others. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh Education Department on Tuesday rebuffed the rumours regarding closure of schools in Karachi amid heavy rain forecast. Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz had predicted heavy downpour in Sindh, with Karachi likely to get more than 150 millimeters rain.  Speaking on Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', Sarfaraz warned heavy downpour was expected from tonight in Karachi and would continue for the next three to four days. \"The monsoon system is expected to grow stronger after August 28 as Karachi may receive as much as 150-200 millimeters rain,\" he said. The heavy rain forecast set off the rumour mill with port city's residents speculating whether the schools will remain open in the metropolis or not. However, a spokesperson for the education department rejected the speculations and said all educational institutions in Sindh, including Karachi, will remain open tomorrow (Wednesday). The department also instructed management of all private and government schools were instructed to remain in touch with students’ parents. It also urged the parents to avoid rumours and speculations regarding the schools’ closure. Notably, urban flooding as a result of torrential downpours is also feared in Karachi and other cities of Sindh. Meanwhile, the PMD said low pressure in the form of a deep depression was present in Indian Gujarat and monsoon winds under the said weather system’s influence were affecting Sindh. \"The center of the system may reach the Arabian Sea on August 29,” it said. Moreover, in its forecast, the meteorological department mentioned that heavy rain could last in Karachi till August 31. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday had alerted all local bodies, district administration, and the irrigation department to brace themselves for timely action in case of any emergency."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In the wake of multiple terrorist attacks recently marring Balochistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the government would equip the armed forces with all resources to eradicate terrorism, as it is now the time to do so. \"Chief of the Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir and the armed forces personnel are determined to purge the country of this scourge,\" the premier told a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad. Calling the recent terror incidents a “moment of reflection”, he said, reiterating that there was no room for terrorists in the country. The government would neither hold any talks with the enemies nor show leniency towards them, as the whole nation was unanimously determined to eliminate terrorists aiming to disrupt the country’s journey towards progress, he resolved. However, he said, doors of talks were open for only those who recognised the country's Constitution and flag. PM Shehbaz said the nefarious intentions of the terrorists would fail and they would be crushed. The terrorists would completely be eradicated, come what may, he reemphasised. In a series of violent attacks across Balochistan for the past couple of weeks, particularly those carried out between Sunday night and Monday, terrorists separately targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In the Rarasham area of the province's Musakhel district, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks on Monday. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. PM Shehbaz regretted the aforementioned attacks, adding that more than 50 citizens as well as personnel of security forces were martyred in the recent terrorist incidents. \"Innocent people were killed in Dera Ismail Khan and Karak as well,\" he said, adding that the Khawarij terrorists operated from across the border in Afghanistan. Condemning the terror attacks in Balochistan, the PM also said the terrorists wanted to halt Pakistan’s development, by thwarting the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other development projects. \"The terrorists want to create a rift between Pakistan and China as well as anarchy within the country,” he said. Announcing to visit Balochistan soon to review its situation, he said the nation should recognise its enemies and unite to defeat them. Shehbaz said the terrorists were mistaken that they could achieve their goal of spreading terror by killing innocent people. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that no operation is required to establish writ of the state as \"even an SHO alone is enough for these terrorists\". \"We need to go after those who are backing these incidents,\" he added. Naqvi stated this while addressing a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti after a special meeting on the law and order situation held at CM House today.   The session was attended by chief secretary, additional chief secretary, Inspector General Police (IGP), and other senior officers. During the session, the participants reviewed the law and order situation and a briefing was given on recent terrorist attacks in the province. The interior minister said that the terrorism incidents in Balochistan could not be tolerated and \"those people who are thinking to spread fear via these incidents would get a good message soon\". He said that the country's leadership including PM Shehbaz is concerned over the security situation in Balochistan. Addressing the same press conference, CM Bugti said that he held a detailed discussion on the law and order situation with the interior minister today, adding that terrorists were still being followed."

  "content": "GHOTKI: A local journalist, Bachal Ghunio, was shot dead by unknown suspects in the Sindh district on Tuesday, Geo News reported, citing police. According to the police, the journalist was gunned down during a visit to his fields. The journalist's body, the police added, has been shifted to the Taluka head quarter Ubuaro hospital with investigations underway. With locals blaming dacoits for Ghunio's killing, his family has held a protest outside the office of the senior superintendent of police in Mirpur Mathelo, demanding the arrest of the suspects. Ghunio's murder comes in the wake of a notable increase in violence against journalists in the country in recent times making him the ninth one to be killed in 2024. Last month, reporter Malik Hassan Zaib was shot dead by unknown assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Nowshera district while he was travelling with his brother. On May 3, Muhammad Siddique Mengal of Balochistan was killed in a bomb attack. Ashfaq Ahmed Sial from Muzaffargarh was shot by two motorcyclists on May 15, while Kamran Dawar from the Tapi area in North Waziristan was shot dead May 21. On the same day, journalist Nasrullah Gadani was shot by assailants on motorcycles near Korai Goth, 12 kilometres from Mirpur Mathelo, and succumbed to the injuries three days later. Journalist Khalil Jibran of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Landi Kotal area was also shot dead by unidentified assailants on a motorcycle on June 18. Speaking with Geo News, the slain journalist's minor son said there was enmity between his father and some members of the community, however, Ghunio was killed despite the issues being decided upon. He further revealed that opponents had also attacked his father a few years back. Taking notice of the journalist's killing, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has issued directions for the immediate arrest of those responsible for the killing. The chief minister also ordered the intensification of operation against dacoits in the riverine area. Condemning the incident, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon reassured that those responsible for the heinous act will soon be brought to justice. Terming the targeting of journalists as an attack on press freedom, Sindh Assembly Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi has called for the arrest of those responsible for Ghunio's killing. Expressing alarm over attacks on Pakistani journalists in June, the International Press Institute (IPI) global network called on the authorities to ensure the safety and protection of the media. Prior to the IPI's statement, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), in a statement issued in May this year, had said that journalism was \"under threat\" in Pakistan."

After August 28, the official said, the monsoon system will likely intensify as Karachi might receive from 150 millimeters to 200 millimeters of rain. The PMD chief mentioned that wind thunderstorms were also expected with scattered heavy to isolated very heavy falls during this time. Notably, urban flooding as a result of torrential downpours is also feared along with rain inundation in Karachi and other metropolitan cities of Sindh. Meanwhile, the PMD said low pressure in the form of a deep depression was present in Indian Gujarat and monsoon winds under the said weather system’s influence were affecting Sindh. \"The center of the system may reach the Arabian Sea on August 29,” it said. Moreover, in its forecast, the meteorological department mentioned that heavy rain could last in Karachi till August 31.

On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister of Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government had established a rain emergency cell at the Chief Minister House in Karachi. Following fear of storm, he advised fishermen not to go into the sea. “Necessary machinery has been given to towns for drainage and the water drainage system of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board has been made better,” he said, informing about the immediate measures the Sindh government has taken to cope with an emergency rain situation. CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday had alerted all local bodies, district administration, and the irrigation department to brace themselves for timely action in case of any emergency."

  "content": "    KARACHI: Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho on Wednesday said that new details emerged from the ongoing investigation into the Karsaz road accident, which suggested that the suspect shouldn't have been driving the vehicle.  Speaking to journalists this evening, Odho said he doesn’t want to divulge into the details as investigation into the accident — that killed two people and left at least three others injured — was underway. \"A final opinion could only be made after holding consultation with medical authorities,\" he said, adding that the police will also take medical experts on board in this regard.  Earlier, Inspector General of Sindh Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon decided to form a special investigation team to probe the Karsaz road accident case. The IGP said an officer of senior superintendent of police (SSP) rank would work with the investigation team, as they were taking it as a high-profile case. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on August 19. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was reportedly in critical condition. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. As per the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on the phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the SUV driver hit his brother’s bike from the rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving license, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. They said that charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR."

  "content": "   KARACHI: As Sindh, including Karachi, braces for heavy downpours amid a forecast of deep depression approaching, the provincial authorities said they have taken significant steps to mitigate the impact and deal with the potential risk of urban flooding in the province. The port city witnessed intermittent showers throughout the night and today with the minimum temperature recorded at 26°C and maximum expected to hover between 30°C to 32°C. The weather department said humidity in the air was recorded at 92% and the winds were blowing at a speed of 16 kilometres per hour. According to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the highest rainfall – recorded between 8am to 5pm – was 20 millimetres in Nazimabad, followed by 16.5mm in Kemari, 13mm in Gulshan-e-Hadeed, 11.5mm in Quaidabad, 9.5mm in Orangi Town, 8.5mm at Old Airport and University Road, 8mm in Saddar, 7mm at Sharea Faisal, 6mm in Maripur and Jinnah Terminal. Other areas, including Gulshan-e-Maymar, Korangi, Tariq Road, Liaquatabad, Model Colony and Gurumandir, also experienced significant rainfall, leading to water accumulation on roads. Sources told Geo News that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has stopped small aeroplanes from flying amid severe weather conditions. Moreover, light-weighted aircraft have been parked safely. During heavy rains, small aeroplanes face difficulties in flying due to reduced visibility and strong winds. However, major domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport remain underway. Meanwhile, Sindh's Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General (DG) Syed Salman Shah urged the public to stay informed through official channels and adhere to safety precautions during current heavy rainfall. The downpour is likely to affect areas near Karachi and Badin, posing a risk of flash flooding and urban flooding in low-lying areas, he said while speaking to a private news channel. Shah said that the disaster management authority was reviewing arrangements and taking significant steps to manage the ongoing rainfall in the province. In a bid to mitigate the impact of the heavy downpour, the PDMA was providing dewatering pumps to various district administrations and municipal corporations.  Additionally, the PDMA is working closely with district authorities to identify vulnerable areas and take proactive measures to protect lives and property, he added. The authority is also coordinating with emergency services, including rescue teams and medical personnel, to ensure a swift response to any emergencies that may arise, he mentioned. By taking proactive measures, the authority aims to reduce the risk of flooding and ensure a safe and secure environment for the people of Sindh, he added. Speaking to Geo News, Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz forecasted up to 200mm of rain in Karachi and 300mm in other cities of the province from August 29 to August 31. He pointed out that a low-pressure system was currently present at Tharparkar’s South — which according to him may head towards the southwest and cause heavy downpours with strong winds in the metropolis and other cities, including Sajawal and Thatta, tomorrow.    “Karachi may receive 150 to 200mm rain in the next two to three days,” Sarfaraz said. The PMD chief mentioned that wind thunderstorms were also expected with scattered heavy to isolated very heavy falls during this time. On the other hand, the Met Office – in a statement said – a deep depression currently located over Nagarparkar and adjoining coastal areas of Sindh, which is likely to move west/southwest during the next 24 hours. “Due to this weather system, strong monsoon currents are penetrating in the country (especially southern parts),” it said, adding a westerly wave was also likely to affect upper parts of the country from tomorrow. The meteorological department warned that torrential rains may generate pluvial flood/inundation in low-lying parts of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. Torrential rains may also generate flash flooding in hill torrents of DG Khan and local nullahs/streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbella.  Meanwhile, the Sindh Education Department has delegated the authority of school closure to respective Deputy Commissioners (DCs) owing to heavy rain and flooding. In a letter to all DCs in the province, the department noted that a monsoon season was underway in various districts and the “same is expected to prevail for few more days.” Given the intensity of heavy rains and damages in respective districts, the letter said, the deputy commissioners can announce local holidays in schools.  The deputy commissioners of Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas shut down all private and government schools in their respective districts.  Later, deputy commissioners of Hyderabad, Badin and Sujawal announced holiday for all private and public educational institutions tomorrow (Thursday) in light of monsoon rains.  Meanwhile, the Mirpurkhas DC announced all educational institutions in the district will remain closed for two days.  Moreover, Nawabshah and Jamshoro DCs announced holiday for all private and public educational institutions for three days due to monsoon rains.  With additional input from APP"

  "description": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  founder Imran Khan.   Reuters/File  Sources say university has received several emails with concerns. Oxford to shortlist of candidates fit for position in early October.Khan says he wants to \"give back\" to university for its help. <p...",
  "content": " LONDON: As incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder seeks nomination for ceremonial post of Oxford University's chancellor, the prestigious British varsity has received a number of emails and a petition raising concerns about the former premier's candidacy. University sources have confirmed that its office has received several emails raising concerns about his support for the Taliban in the past and corruption cases. The university has told Geo News that the shortlist of candidates fit for the position of Oxford's chancellor will be announced in early October. Khan has said from jail that he has submitted his nomination to run for Oxford’s new chancellor because the university helped him in his early years and he wanted to \"give back\" and that \"I am committed to giving back to the world the resilience, determination and integrity that life has taught me, even when the odds are stacked against me\". The petition to the university says that \"while Mr Khan is a prominent figure, there are significant aspects of his public and personal record that are deeply troubling and deserve careful consideration\". It tells the Oxford University: \"Mr Imran Khan has frequently expressed views and taken actions that align with extremist elements, particularly the Taliban. Mr Khan has proposed allowing the Taliban to open an office in Pakistan, which sparked widespread criticism both within the country and internationally. This suggestion was particularly alarming given the Taliban’s history of violence and human rights abuses. He has referred to the Taliban as freedom fighters', especially during the US presence in Afghanistan. After the US withdrawal, Mr Khan celebrated the event as the Afghans 'breaking the shackles of slavery', a statement widely interpreted as support for the Taliban's return to power.\" The petition says that Imran Khan also supported Osama Bin Laden.  \"In a speech to Pakistan’s National Assembly, Mr Khan controversially referred to Osama bin Laden as a 'shaheed' (martyr), a term that honours his death rather than condemning his actions as a global terrorist. Mr Khan has made numerous statements that have drawn criticism for promoting misogynistic views. He has repeatedly blamed women's clothing for incidents of rape, claiming that 'if a woman wears very few clothes, it will have an impact on men unless they’re robots'. Such remarks shift the blame away from the perpetrators and perpetuate harmful stereotypes about women.\"  The petition says that Khan supporters harassed and attacked critics and trolled them online. \"This use of social media to silence critics and discredit accusers reflects a disturbing pattern of behaviour that raises serious questions about Mr Khan's respect for women’s rights and personal integrity.\" The petition questions Khan's personal integrity and reminds the university that \"Mr Khan was recently convicted in the Toshakhana case, which involved the illegal sale of state gifts. This conviction raises serious concerns about his commitment to transparency and ethical governance.\" The petition asks the university to \"carefully consider the broader implications of electing Khan as chancellor.  \"Oxford University has a long history of upholding the highest standards of leadership, ethical behaviour, and respect for human rights — values that seem at odds with Mr Khan’s public and personal record,\" it says. The cricketer-turned-politician has confirmed he has applied to be in the running as the next chancellor of the University of Oxford for a 10-year term.  Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Keble College. He has previously served as chancellor of the University of Bradford from 2005 until 2014, is vying to replace conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who announced in February his resignation as Oxford’s chancellor. The final list will be announced after a month but reports have said that Lord William Hague, the former foreign secretary, Lord Peter Mandelson, the Labour grandee, and Lady Angiolini, the prominent lawyer who led the inquiry into the rape, abduction and murder of Sarah Everard will also be running for the post. More than 250,000 Oxford alumni will vote in an online ballot later this year. The successful candidate will serve a 10-year term, supporting Prof Irene Tracey, the current vice-chancellor."

Screengrab via YouTube/@SenateofPakistanOfficialSenator Kakar underscores multi-prong strategy for war on terror.He says militants are mere 1% of people who lack mass support.Ex-PM...",
  "content": "With the country still mourning the precious loss of lives in recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan, Independent Senator and former caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar has termed the fight against terrorism a \"national war\", stressing it is not an isolated struggle of the country's security forces and intelligence agencies. Reflecting on the recent violence in Balochistan during the Senate session on Tuesday, Senator Kakar said: \"This is a national war and not an isolated fight of the Frontier Corps, Pakistan Army, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Military Intelligence (MI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB).\" The lawmaker's remarks come in the wake of recent bloodshed in the country's largest province by terrorist groups which saw more than two dozen people, including security personnel, being martyred. On Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil including ten security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were martyred in clearance operations — launched after at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorist incidents — wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Addressing the Upper House, Senator Kakar said that the prerogative over violence only rested with the state. However, he added, an attempt was being made to \"create a gap between institutions\" that have been made responsible for violence management by the Constitution. \"The beginning of the victory in this war starts with accepting them [security forces, LEAs] as the protector of our home, locality, province and country,\" he said. Furthermore, he underscored that all necessary assistance, whether on the legal front via the promulgation of necessary laws or on the financial front, all-out support to the security forces and the LEAs including the provision of equipment, narrative building etc. \"This is a war based on a multi-prong strategy,\" the senator noted. Continuing on the terrorists' nefarious objectives, Kakar said that the militants target whoever is standing with the state of Pakistan whether it is the Baloch, Pashtoon or anyone else. Commenting on Baloch terrorist outfits, he noted that their narrative wasn't that they were deprived of their rights, but in fact, they claim their separate identity alleging us of occupying their land and that they wanted to break Pakistan and establish another state of their own. \"Who are they [terrorists]? They are a mere 1% [of the masses] if they were not and they had the support of a large section of Baloch society then they would come to the ballot and not resort to armed struggle,\" the lawmaker stressed, adding that the militants were targeting the country's resolve targeting so that we give up this fight. On the issue of negotiations with the terrorists, Kakar said that dialogue was a mere tool for the end goal which needs to be defined. Censuring the ones who misled the country regarding holding talks with the militants, he said: \"Who were they ones who misled and deceived the people of this country over the delusion of negotiations [...] we believed them to have informed opinion but they misled the parliament\". Highlighting the need to address the internal confusion, he called for leaving aside all political differences and for a uniform effort to carve a way forward including a serious debate regarding the use of force, negotiations as other matters."

  "content": "As Pakistanis grapple with the ongoing socio-political, economic, and security issues, they also remain threatened by climate-induced challenges such as air pollution, risking not only their habitat but also their overall health and well-being. In an annual Air Quality Index (AQLI) report produced by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC), the adverse effects of the country's worsening air pollution has been found to significantly affect the life expectancy of its citizens. According to the report, Pakistanis — as part of South Asia, the world's most polluted region — are exposed to particulate pollution levels that are 22.3% higher than that experienced at the turn of the century. The report maintained that since virtually the entire population of Pakistan breathes air that doesn't meet the PM2.5 standard set at 15 µg/m³, people's life expectancy could be increased by 2.3 years if the country is able to meet its own PM2.5 standard. \"In Pakistan, where the PM2.5 concentration was 38.9 µg/m³ in 2022 — 10% lower compared to the particulate levels in 2021, the average resident would gain 3.3 years from meeting the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline,\" read the AQLI 2024 annual update. \"Those in Peshawar, the most polluted city in the country, would gain 5.6 years,\" it added. Elaborating on the increase in factors affecting air pollution, the AQLI underscored an approximately fourfold increase in the number of vehicles in the country since the early 2000s as well as a significant increase in the use of fossil fuel for electricity generation. Noting that 94 out of 252 countries and territories globally had national standards, making up 80% of the world's population, it highlighted that 37 of those countries weren't meeting them — which amounts to 30%of the world's population. Terming global pollution as the \"greatest external threat to human life expectancy\", the report stated that people in the most polluted areas of the world breathe air that is six times more polluted than those in the least polluted areas, which in return, reduces their life expectancy is reduced by an average of 2.7 years compared to those living in the cleanest places."

  "content": "As Pakistan gears up to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) moot in October this year, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said that Islamabad would definitely invite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the regional summit. Asif made the statement while speaking to a private news channel amid speculations that PM Modi will not attend the upcoming SCO meeting as per reports aired by some media outlets as both South Asian nations have a history of strained ties, particularly due to the longstanding Kashmir dispute. Before the October summit, the Foreign Office spokesperson said in July that there would be a ministerial meeting and multiple rounds of senior officials meetings to concentrate on fostering cooperation in finance, economics, socio-cultural affairs and humanitarian efforts among SCO member countries. \"Yes, certainly there should be no doubt about it,\" said the defence minister when asked whether Pakistan would invite the Indian premier to the SCO summit. Elaborating on the matter, Asif recalled that India had invited then-foreign minister Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari to Delhi when it hosted the regional summit in July 2023. The defence minister said the host country could not pick and choose about inviting the heads of state, adding that not extending an invitation to any member state was inappropriate and the SCO would not accept any such move by any host member state. A day earlier, Indian government denied the media reports suggesting that PM Modi would not attend upcoming SCO summit in Pakistan. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a clarification urging media outlets to refrain from speculating on the matter, according to a report published in The News. “We have noticed several outlets are running news that the PM [Modi] won’t attend an SCO meeting in Pakistan or EAM [external affairs minister] will attend an SCO meeting in Pakistan,” Indian media quoted the country foreign ministry as saying. “MEA hasn’t commented on this matter and would request speculative news in this regard be avoided.” The statement emphasised India's position that no official decision had been made regarding the prime minister’s participation in the SCO meeting in Pakistan. The SCO, led by Russia and China, is a crucial multilateral platform for India, primarily for regional security and collaboration with Central Asian nations. India views the SCO as an essential forum for engaging with these countries, despite its cautious approach to China’s influence within the organisation. Unlike other member states, India has consistently refused to endorse China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has been a point of contention in SCO joint statements. Speaking about the reports that Iran has announced moving an arbitration court against Pakistan for not constructing the pipeline under the IP gas project, Asif said Pakistan should complete the gas pipeline project saying it \"suits [Pakistan] economically\". \"[...] Iran is our neighbourly country and if we need oil, gas or any other mineral resources then the neighbourly countries are economically beneficial,\" he said."

Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz had said the peak of this monsoon spell was yet to be seen as more than 150 millimeters rain was likely to batter the port city this week.

The heavy rain forecast set off the rumour mill with port city's residents speculating whether the schools will remain open in the metropolis or not. However, the Sindh education department rebuffed the rumours and said all educational institutions in Sindh, including Karachi, will remain open tomorrow (Wednesday).  A spokesperson for the education department, in a statement said, the management of all private and government schools were instructed to remain in touch with students’ parents.  The spokesperson also urged the parents to avoid rumours and speculations regarding the schools’ closure.  Notably, urban flooding as a result of torrential downpours is also feared in Karachi and other cities of Sindh. Meanwhile, the PMD said low pressure in the form of a deep depression was present in Indian Gujarat and monsoon winds under the said weather system’s influence were affecting Sindh. \"The center of the system may reach the Arabian Sea on August 29,” it said. Moreover, in its forecast, the meteorological department mentioned that heavy rain could last in Karachi till August 31.

An amount of $130 million was saved in the national exchequer by halting the import of urea and by ensuring uninterrupted gas supply to urea fertilizer units for the upcoming Rabi crop. On the recommendations of the Ministry of Housing and Works, proposals were presented in the federal cabinet regarding the dissolution of Pakistan Public Works Department (PWD), transfer of its staff and ongoing projects to other ministries and institutions. The meeting was informed that on the directions of the prime minister, necessary maintenance staff and inquiries were being handed over to the ministries concerned and provincial governments to continue uninterrupted work on the ongoing development and PSDP projects tasked to PWD. In this regard, the federal cabinet approved the recommendations of the Ministry of Housing and Works. The cabinet was presented with the recommendations of the Rightsizing of the Federal Government Committee set up for Institutional Reforms, headed by the finance minister. The cabinet was informed that in order to improve the performance of the federal government, proper use of manpower, removal of unnecessary impediments in the policy-making and implementation of decisions, and to further strengthen the most important departments and bodies, the first phase of work on committee’s recommendations about six ministries had already been initiated. The meeting was further informed that in the light of the recommendations of the committee, a total of 82 government bodies related to these ministries were being merged and dissolved into 40 such institutions, in which digitisation, smart management, efficient governance, transparent and speedy implementation of projects and better provision of facilities to the common man would be ensured. The federal cabinet also approved the recommendations of the committee and set up a committee to ensure the protection of the interests of the employees who were expected to be affected by the merger and dissolution of these entities. The meeting was given a detailed briefing on the progress on the ongoing austerity drive and implementation of measures under the prime minister’s vision and directives to reduce government expenditure. The federal cabinet nodded for the continuation of the austerity drive approved by the cabinet under the leadership of PM Shehbaz during the previous tenure of his government. These measures included voluntary non-withdrawal of salaries by the cabinet members, ban on purchase of government vehicles other than essential vehicles such as ambulances, ban on purchase of new equipment and machinery, creation of new government posts, non-essential foreign travel at the government expenses and ban on treatment abroad. The prime minister urged the ministers to ensure that austerity measures were being implemented in their relevant ministries and institutions. He also lauded their efforts in ensuring implementation of austerity measures. The cabinet also endorsed the decisions taken in the meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) held on August 22, 2024."

  "content": "   As the country continues to reel under back-to-back terrorist attacks, the United States and China came out in support of the country, strongly condemning the latest militant forays in Balochistan and pledging support to Pakistan in countering terrorism. Balochistan witnessed one the deadliest attacks on Monday that left more than 50 dead, including civilians, police and military personnel in a single day.  The attacks sent shock waves across the country, drawing condemnations from the government and foreign countries.  Condemning the militant attacks, Pakistan's long-time regional ally China extended its support and expressed deep grief over the dastardly attacks in the southwestern resource-rich province, home to major China-led projects such as a port and a gold and copper mine. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said at a regular press briefing on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemns the attacks in Pakistan and will continue to give strong support to the country in anti-terrorism action. \"China stands firm against all forms of terrorism. We will continue giving staunch support to Pakistan in its effort to advance counter-terrorism operations, uphold social solidarity and stability, and protect the safety of the people,\" Lin Jian said. He reaffirmed China's readiness to enhance counter-terrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan further and jointly safeguard peace and security in the region. Similarly, taking the gravity of the situation into account, Washington strongly regretted the deaths of law enforcers and civilians in Balochistan's Musakhail and other areas.  \"Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those killed in yesterday’s attacks. The United States will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism,\" the US embassy in Islamabad wrote on its official X account.  Meanwhile, the European Union also condemned the heinous attacks in the southwestern province of the country. \"Terrorism and violence in any form have no place. They threaten the foundations of democracy. Our thoughts are with those affected [by] this senseless act,\" the EU Commission Spokesperson Nabila Massrali wrote on X.  Moreover, Germany also extended support by showing solidarity with the attack victims and expressing concern about the \"recent surge in violence in Balochistan\" that resulted in loss of precious lives.  \"Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims. We hope for a swift restoration of peace and stability in the region,\" the German Consul General in Karachi.  Monday saw a series of horrific attacks as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In response, security forces gunned down 21 terrorists and injured several others. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism.  — With additional input from Reuters"

AFPImran, Bushra seek post-arrest bail citing \"interest of justice\".Couple files separate applications via Barrister Salman Safdar.Former PM and ex-first lady are in Adiala jail...",
  "content": " ISLAMABAD: Incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have filed separate post-arrest bail pleas in the new Toshakhana case pertaining to a jewellery set gifted by the Saudi crown prince. Mentioning the state and chairman National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as parties to the case, both the applications filed through Barrister Salman Safdar under Section 9(b) of NA Ordinance 1999 and Section 497 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) request the accountability court to grant post-arrest bail to the couple to in \"interest of justice and fair play\". The development comes as both Imran and Bushra are on judicial remand in Adiala jail over the Toshakhana reference filed by the anti-graft watchdog last week.   The duo was arrested in the said case on July 13 hours after a district and sessions court in Islamabad acquitted them in the iddat case — also known as the un-Islamic nikah case — which was the last hurdle in the couple's release from jail before the filing of the new cases.   The reference — which consists of two volumes — was filed by NAB investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan in an accountability court. The fresh reference will now be reviewed by the registrar of the accountability courts. After removing the objections, the reference will be sent to the administrative judge of the accountability court. The administrative judge will then decide whether to conduct the hearing himself or transfer it to another accountability court. It should be noted that administrative Judge Nasir Javed Rana is already hearing the £190 million reference against the PTI founder. The new NAB reference pertains to a case related to a jewellery set gifted to former first lady Bushra by the Saudi crown prince when Imran was the prime minister of the country from 2018 to 2022.  The jewellery set — comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings — was gifted to the former first lady on her visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2021, as per the NAB's reference. It said the PTI founder and his wife have illegally kept the jewellery set. It added that the deputy military secretary briefed the Toshakhana section officer to estimate and declare the price of the jewellery set.  The jewellery set, it mentioned, was not deposited in Toshakhana. The jewellery company sold the necklace for €300,000 and earrings for €80,000 on May 25, 2018. The information regarding the price of the bracelet and ring could not be obtained from the company. On May 28, 2021, the price of the jewellery set was estimated at Rs70.56 million; the price of the necklace was Rs50.64 million and the price of the earrings included in the jewellery valued at Rs10.50 million back then. According to the rules, the 50% price of the jewellery set is approximately Rs30.57 million.   The national exchequer suffered a loss of approximately Rs30.28 after the jewellery was undervalued.  As per the reference, the PTI founder and his wife violated the NAB Ordinance. It added that an inquiry was initiated against the former first couple on the instructions of the NAB chairman on August 1, 2022. “[The] PTI founder and Bushra have misused their powers. [The] PTI founder retained 58 out of 108 gifts during his prime ministership,” read the reference."

  "content": "   At least 25 terrorists, including a ring leader, were gunned down by security forces in multiple ongoing intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Tirah valley of Khyber district since August 20, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday. According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the security forces are conducting “extensive IBOs” in Tirah valley against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) labelled as Fitna-Al-Khwarij and militant outfits “Laskar-e-Islam and Jamat-ul-Ahrar”. These operations, it said, were based on robust intelligence and resulted into major setbacks to Fitna-Al-Khwarij and its affiliates.  During the intelligence-based operations being conducted since August 20, the security forces so far killed 25 terrorists, including a ring leader named Abuzar aka Saddam.  “However, four soldiers, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom”, the ISPR added.  “The heavy losses inflicted upon Fitna-Al-Khwarij in these operations is testament to the valor and commitment of security forces to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country,” it concluded. On Aug 25, terrorists attacked a check post in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Central Kurram, resulting in martyrdom of one policeman.  Similarly, security forces killed seven terrorists and wounded five others during an IBO in the Kurram district earlier this month. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. A day earlier, Balochistan faced a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces.  In response, security forces gunned down 21 terrorists and injured several others.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In response to a series of terror attacks in Balochistan over the past few days, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that no dialogue could be held with the enemy, nor could a 'soft approach' be taken in dealing with them. Addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad today, the prime minister said it was time to uproot terrorism and the government would provide all the available resources to the armed forces for this purpose. “Doors of negotiations are open [only] for those who recognise the constitution and flag of Pakistan, but there is no room for terrorists,” he maintained. The premier said the nefarious intentions of the terrorists would fail and they would be crushed. The terrorists would completely be eradicated, come what may, the PM reemphasised. In a series of violent attacks across Balochistan over the past few weeks, especially those carried out between Sunday night and Monday, terrorists separately targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In the Rarasham area of the province's Musakhel district, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Regretting the dastardly attacks, PM Shehbaz said that more than 50 citizens as well as security personnel embraced martyrdom in the recent terrorist incidents.  \"Innocent people were killed in Dera Ismail Khan and Karak as well,\" he said, adding that the Khawarij terrorists operated from across the border in Afghanistan. Condemning the terror attacks in Balochistan, the PM also said the terrorists wanted to halt Pakistan’s development, by thwarting the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other development projects. \"The terrorists want to create a rift between Pakistan and China as well as anarchy within the country,” he said. Announcing to visit Balochistan soon to review its situation, he said the nation should recognise its enemies and unite to defeat them. Shehbaz said the terrorists were mistaken that they could achieve their goal of spreading terror by killing innocent people. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that no operation is required to establish writ of the state as \"even an SHO alone is enough for these terrorists\". \"We need to go after those who are backing these incidents,\" he added. Naqvi stated this while addressing a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti after a special meeting on the law and order situation held at CM House today.   The session was attended by chief secretary, additional chief secretary, Inspector General Police (IGP), and other senior officers. During the session, the participants reviewed the law and order situation and a briefing was given on recent terrorist attacks in the province. The interior minister said that the terrorism incidents in Balochistan could not be tolerated and \"those people who are thinking to spread fear via these incidents would get a good message soon\". He said that the country's leadership including PM Shehbaz is concerned over the security situation in Balochistan. Addressing the same press conference, CM Bugti said that he held a detailed discussion on the law and order situation with the interior minister today, adding that terrorists were still being followed."

  "content": "GHOTKI: A local journalist was gunned down in Sindh's Ghotki district, police told Geo News on Tuesday. The locals have blamed dacoits for the killing of journalist Bachal Ghunio. According to the police, the deceased had gone to his fields when he was attacked. They added that the journalist's body has been shifted to Taluka head quarter Ubuaro hospital with investigations underway.   Reacting to Ghunio's killing, his family held a protest outside the office of the senior superintendent of police in Mirpur Mathelo, demanding the arrest of the suspects. Ghunio's murder comes in the wake of a notable increase in violence against journalists in the country in recent times making him the ninth one to be killed in 2024. Last month, reporter Malik Hassan Zaib was shot dead by unknown assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Nowshera district while he was travelling with his brother. On May 3, Muhammad Siddique Mengal of Balochistan was killed in a bomb attack. Ashfaq Ahmed Sial from Muzaffargarh was shot by two motorcyclists on May 15, while Kamran Dawar from the Tapi area in North Waziristan was shot dead May 21. On the same day, journalist Nasrullah Gadani was shot by assailants on motorcycles near Korai Goth, 12 kilometres from Mirpur Mathelo, and succumbed to the injuries three days later. Journalist Khalil Jibran of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Landi Kotal area was also shot dead by unidentified assailants on a motorcycle on June 18. Speaking with Geo News, the slain journalist's minor son said there was enmity between his father and some members of the community, however, Ghunio was killed despite the issues being decided upon. He further revealed that opponents had also attacked his father a few years back. Taking notice of the journalist's killing, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has issued directions for the immediate arrest of those responsible for the killing. The chief minister also ordered the intensification of operation against dacoits in the riverine area. Condemning the incident, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon reassured that those responsible for the heinous act will soon be brought to justice. Terming the targeting of journalists as an attack on press freedom, Sindh Assembly Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi has called for the arrest of those responsible for Ghunio's killing. Expressing alarm over attacks on Pakistani journalists in June, the International Press Institute (IPI) global network called on the authorities to ensure the safety and protection of the media. Prior to the IPI's statement, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), in a statement issued in May this year, had said that journalism was \"under threat\" in Pakistan."

  "content": "The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Naib Emir Liaqat Baloch announced on Monday that the religio-political party would observe a shutter-down strike across the country on August 28 to mount pressure on the coalition government to provide relief to the masses. Baloch, while addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, said that trader community made a unanimous decision of observing a nationwide strike against inflation, high electricity prices and imposition of hefty taxes.  He warned that any attempt by the government to stop the strike would push the country into anarchy. The politico reminded that his party staged a 14-day protest in Rawalpindi and held negotiations with the federal government. The ministers had signed an agreement after accepting the JI's demands for providing relief to the inflation-hit nation earlier this month. He added that a one-month deadline was set to review the contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) in the agreement. The JI naib emir demanded the government to implement the agreement.  Baloch also hinted at starting a long march to Islamabad if needed. He added that his party had just postponed the sit-in after signing an agreement with the government, however, they would continue their struggle to get relief for the nation. Prior to giving a strike call, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman had announced another protest two weeks ago, saying that his party would give a call for peaceful protest by joining hands with trader groups. The protests' announcement came after the party postponed its 14-day long sit-in on August 9 following successful negotiations with the government over demands including slashing high power tariffs and reviewing agreements with the IPPs which have been under the spotlight as people are paying hefty bills blamed on capacity payments being made to independent power producers."

  "description": "Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab warned citizens against unnecessary movement on Thursday as more rain is expected due to a potential cyclone over the Rann of Kutch in India that is likely to emerge along the Sindh coast tomorrow morning. According to an alert from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued at 10pm today, a deep depression over the Rann of Kutch has very slowly moved west/southwest over the last 12 hours and now lies around 250 kilometres east/southeast of Karachi. “The system is likely keep moving further west/southwestwards, emerge into northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh coast by tomorrow morning and intensify further into a cyclonic storm due to favourable environmental conditions, sea surface temperature, low/moderate vertical wind shear and upper-level divergence,” the statement read. According to Zoom Earth’s live radar, the system has a high chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 24 hours. “It’s been raining since last three days and in the next few hours, it is expected that there will be heavier rainfall with strong winds,” Mayor Wahab said on X as he urged people to avoid unnecessary movement.         Under the system’s influence, widespread rain and thunderstorms, along with scattered heavy/very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls, are likely till August 31 in the Karachi division as well as Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts.    This satellite image captured at 9:30pm on Aug 29 shows a deep depression developing over the northeast Arabian Sea. — PMD  Sea conditions are likely to remain very rough with squally winds of 50 to 60 km/hour, the PMD alert warned. It advised fishermen not to venture into the sea till August 31. “PMD’s cyclone warning centre in Karachi is monitoring the system and will issue the update accordingly,” the statement said. “The concerned authorities are requested to keep them abreast through PMD advisory.” The powerful weather system made its presence felt early on Tuesday morning with a windstorm and heavy showers lashing Karachi, disrupting life and damaging civic infrastructure. The PMD’s forecast of up to 200mm of rain in Karachi and 500mm in other cities in Sindh has kept the authorities on their toes to take urgent measures to deal with the potential risk of urban flooding. Ban on fishing, swimming in Karachi sea; schools closed In view of the PMD alert, a ban on “fishermen venturing into the sea, as well as on swimming, bathing, diving, and wading in the sea/beaches and coastal areas” of Karachi Division has been imposed, effective from today till Aug 31 (Saturday). According to a notification issued today by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the ban was imposed under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to “avoid any untoward incident of drowning and to save precious lives of the general public”. The notification highlighted that sea conditions were “likely to remain rough to very rough, with squally winds of 50-60km/hour”. It added that the South district commissioner had suggested imposing the ban “given the expected rough sea conditions, which may endanger the lives of people intending to visit the beach for swimming or those involved in fishing activities in the open sea”. The Keamari DC also “reported high tides and turbulent waves in the Arabian Sea”, the notification stated. Commissioner Naqvi also empowered the station house officers concerned to register cases under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code against those who violate the ban. The commissioner also ordered that all public and private schools would remain closed in the city on Friday. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered the local administration and all relevant departments to remain vigilant. “All necessary preparations needed to deal with any emergency situation should be completed,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa. The chief minister also directed the health department to ensure that the province’s hospitals “improved their arrangements”. He also issued instructions to the fisheries department regarding fishermen’s safety amid “extraordinary sea conditions”. “Continue monitoring the rivers, streams and other water passages,” CM Murad ordered the water department.         In the 24 hours up to 8am today, the Tharparkar district received the highest amount of rainfall in Sindh — 347 millimetres across seven tehsils — the PMD said in an update. Karachi recorded a cumulative 190mm of rain with Surjani Town receiving the highest amount (30mm). Mirpurkhas district witnessed 143mm of rain while Hyderabad and Badin got a close 116mm and 112mm, respectively. According to the Met Office, the maximum wind speed was recorded at Masroor Base (67km/hour) and Faisal Base (52km/hour). Thousands evacuated as cyclone builds Meanwhile, heavy rains battered India and Pakistan’s coastal areas along the Arabian Sea, flooding cities in western India’s Gujarat state and forcing thousands of people from their homes, with authorities predicting the cyclonic storm to develop by Friday. People waded through waist-high waters that partly submerged vehicles and roads in parts of the state, visuals from Reuters television showed. At least 28 people have died this week from rain-related incidents in the state, officials said, as meteorologists in India and Pakistan warned that more heavy downpours and strong winds were expected to lash the coast. “There is no electricity for the last two days,” said Prabhu Ram Soni, who lives in Gujarat’s coastal city of Jamnagar. “I have an eight-month-old daughter and an asthma patient, my mother, who is on oxygen support.” More than 18,000 have been evacuated since Sunday from cities near the coast, disaster management authorities said. The army was also involved in relief efforts in the state which was hit last year by cyclone Biparjoy, damaging infrastructure and leading to the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. Heavy rains also lashed Jamnagar, home to the world’s largest oil refinery complex, owned by Reliance, the district collector, B K Pandya, told Reuters. At nearby Vadinar, Nayara Energy, backed by Russian groups including its largest oil producer, Rosneft, runs another refinery. “They are operational,” Pandya said, when asked if rain had affected work in the refineries, adding that authorities were focusing on rescue efforts in the district. A deep depression off Gujarat is expected to intensify into a cyclonic storm by Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, but it was forecast to move away from the Indian coast over the next two days. The IMD has forecast extremely heavy rainfall in Gujarat’s Bharuch, Kutch and Saurashtra districts on Friday. "

  "description": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that the recent deadly terrorist attacks in Balochistan were a “wicked scheme” devised by militants, as he visited the province to assess the security situation there. In the latest flare-up of violence, dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks on Sunday midnight across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians. At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives as militants went on a rampage across the province, storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In response, security forces neutralised 21 militants. Among those killed were 23 people in Musakhail, mostly labourers from Punjab, who were offloaded from trucks and vans and shot dead after an identity check. After his arrival in Quetta earlier today, PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting of the National Action Plan’s provincial apex committee. The meeting was attended by Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal as well as other top government and security officials. “Terrorist organisations and the khawarij, who are Pakistan’s enemies, and infiltrators from within concocted this impure scheme, as a result of which Pakistanis were martyred,” the premier told the committee. “There has been a wave of great concern among the people across Pakistan due to the recent heartrending incident that occurred in Balochistan,” PM Shehbaz said. “Everyone is aggrieved on this incident,” the prime minister noted. “However, I think that at the moment, we have to decide that we must fully eradicate terrorism from Balochistan through our collective vision, power, and unwavering determination,” the premier asserted. Highlighting that the province was “extremely important and beautiful”, PM Shehbaz stressed the need to remove “all obstacles from its path to progress”. Recalling that those who lost their lives included law enforcement agencies’ officers and sepoys, jawaans (personnel) of the Levies and Frontier Constabulary, as well as civilians“, Shehbaz asserted that their sacrifices would not go to waste. The prime minister expressed the resolve to eradicate terrorism under the leadership of Gen Munir and CM Bugti, reaffirming the federal government’s full support to that extent. He vowed to root out “terrorism that has surged again since 2018” from not just Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but from the entire country. In his concluding speech, the premier said the federal government had decided to depute all the police and civil officers of the 48th Common Group in Balochistan without discrimination to ensure peace, stability, and development of the province. “After discussion with the interior minister, the army chief and other relevant high authorities, we have made a policy under which all the talented and efficient officers will be deployed in various districts and divisions of the province,” the prime minister said. Announcing the policy, he said half of the officers of the 48th Common Group of both police and civil side would be posted to Balochistan immediately for one year. The remaining half of the 48th Common Group would be posted after six months from their initial deployment who would also serve for one year. Similarly, he said after one year, the first half of the officers from the 49th common group would be posted to Balochistan for one year. After one and a half years, the remaining half of the officers from the 49th group would be posted to Balochistan for one year. The prime minister announced that the officers posted under the policy would be given four air tickets for travel of their families for every quarter. Additionally, these officers might also be given three extra points in their performance subject to their commitment and their service in the province. He said the government would implement the policy immediately with the coordination of the Balochistan government. As regards the possibility of dialogues with terrorists, the prime minister made it clear that the federal and provincial governments, along with all security forces, had an iron resolve to eliminate all anti-state elements who had nefarious designs to destabilise the country. “It is our national, political, and religious duty to fight against such elements,” he said, adding that dialogues could only be possible with those who respected the Constitution and saluted the national flag. “We must differentiate between these two elements to ensure the development and prosperity of the country.” He highlighted that the Gwadar port was vital for the development and prosperity of the province and the country but some anti-state elements did not want the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the port to be operationalised. According to state-run Radio Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, as well as other officials, were also accompanying PM Shehbaz.    Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrives in Quetta on Aug 29, 2024. — DawnNewsTV  Upon arrival at Quetta Airport, the premier was received by CM Bugti, Balochistan Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir, and newly-appointed provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari. Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, Provincial Minister for Communication and Works Abdul Rehman Khetran, and other senior government officials were also present to welcome him.      Naqvi has vowed his full support for the Balochistan government in combating terrorism when he visited the province on Tuesday. While PM Shehbaz on Tuesday asserted that there was “no room for any weakness”, President Asif Ali Zardari had ordered effective measures to ensure the “complete elimination” of terrorism. Sanaullah calls for Balochistan truth and reconciliation commission Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah called for a truth and reconciliation commission for Balochistan with inclusion from the province instead of other places. Sanaullah said the provincial government did not need the federal government’s permission for such a commission. He asked Baloch leaders to come forward and resolve the issues through dialogue. “The leaders of Balochistan should bring the resolution in the provincial assembly so that all public interest matters could be addressed in a proper manner,” he said while talking on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’. He warned that those involved in the recent killings of innocent people in Balochistan would be given exemplary punishment according to law. He invited Baloch leaders to sit together to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the province. Replying to a question about security issues in the province, he said an apex committee was constituted to deal with security matters. He said that the government was committed to rooting out terrorism at all costs. Sanaullah said the government should address and remove any misgivings or concerns of Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and try to win him over. "

  "description": "One policeman was martyred while two were injured during an anti-bandit operation carried out in the riverine areas of Sindh, according to a statement from the Rangers spokesperson on Thursday. Organised criminal gangs have been active in the riverine border areas of southern Sindh and central Punjab for decades, often making money through kidnap-for-ransom assaults. The military had launched a full-scale operation against criminal gangs in Sindh in the early 1990s but they resurfaced after successive governments failed to maintain law and order in the province. The Sindh police and Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) had decided earlier this month to intensify ongoing joint operations against bandits in the province’s riverine areas.      According to a statement issued by the Sindh Rangers spokesperson today, the bandits opened fire on the police, martyring Police Constable Lashari and injuring two others. It added that the martyr hailed from Kandhkot. The statement added that a “most wanted bandit” was killed in retaliatory firing while two bandits escaped with injuries. It added that the slain criminal was named in several first information reports and was the brother of another notorious bandit who had a bounty on his head from the Sindh government. The statement said the “Rangers surrounded the area and six more suspects were detained”, adding that the targeted operation against the escaped bandits was still under way while their hideout was destroyed. The operation came in the wake of a significant ramp up in criminal activities by riverine bandits of Sindh and Punjab. A police van was attacked last week by bandits with rockets, resulting in the deaths of over 12 policemen and multiple injuries to others in Rahim Yar Khan. The Sindh and Punjab governments had vowed decisive action against the outlaws in the inhospitable riverine area. On Saturday, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said a “massive clean-up operation” would be launched in the riverine area as soon as the flood water recedes. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Governor Kamran Tessori on Tuesday took notice of journalist Mohammed Bachal’s killing by dacoits in the katcha (riverine) area of Rounti in Sindh’s Ghotki district. Bachal, a reporter with Awaaz TV, was gunned down by unknown men in Ghotki’s Rounti area. "

  "description": "The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)’s privatisation process will be completed by October 1, Privatisation Commission Secretary Usman Akhtar Bajwa on Thursday told Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation. PIA began to be unprofitable in 2011, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the national flag carrier was saddled with $3 billion in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3bn in debt, up from $2.97bn the year before. Government bailouts were required for the carrier’s continued operation. Last year in June, the then-government had agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises, including PIA, under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion bailout. But in February 2024 — right before the general elections — the election commission had asked the then-caretaker administration to “refrain” from finalising the deal. In April, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb stated that the process of privatising PIA will be finalised by the end of June or early July. During today’s session of the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation, chairman Talal Chaudhry asked the secretary the reason for extending the date for the airlines’ privatisation process once again, inquiring if the date would exceed October 1. “We are trying not to let the date exceed,” the secretary replied, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said he did not want to extend the process beyond October 1. The secretary went on to say that six companies were finalised for the national carrier’s bid, which included Fly Jinnah, Air Blue, Arif Habib Corporation, Y.B. Holdings, Pak Ethanol, and Blue World City. The secretary noted the national flag carrier’s poor performance and deemed it close to “not functioning at all”, adding that the successful bidder would have to cover the gap of Rs80 billion in the first year. “Whoever buys the PIA will also have to clear liabilities of Rs200 billion and spend Rs400 million on ship repairs and other issues,” he stated, adding that the airline’s deficit had reached Rs500bn. Privatisation Min­ister Abdul Aleem Khan had also earlier termed the national flag carrier “a white elephant”, claiming it had caused a loss of Rs830 billion to the national exchequer, so far. Privatisation of distribution companies Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office, in a notification, announced that three distribution companies (Discos), including the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco), and Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco), would be offered for privatisation in phase 1. “In light of the recommendations of the committee on DISCOs, it was decided that Lesco, Gepco, and Fesco shall be offered for complete privatisation in phase 1,” the notification read, adding that Lahore’s Lesco, Mepco in Multan, and Hazeco in Abbottabad shall be offered for “complete privatisation” in phase 2. The notification said that the Privatisation Commission would “initiate the process for the hiring of transaction advisor and complete other formalities as per process” to finish phase 1 of privatisation and outsourcing of the three Discos.

  "description": "The Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday said that Pakistan had invited the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting being held in Islamabad. Pakistan is set to host the SCO heads of government meeting on October 15 -16. The event will be preceded by a ministerial meeting and several rounds of senior officials’ meetings focused on financial, economic, socio-cultural, and humanitarian cooperation among the SCO member states. During a weekly press briefing, the Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed the country had sent invitations to the heads of countries to participate in the meeting. “An invitation has also been sent to the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi,” she said, adding that some countries had already confirmed their participation in the meeting. “It will be informed in due course which country has confirmed,” she added. When asked about ties with India, the spokesperson said, “Pakistan does not have direct bilateral trade with India.” Moreover, the spokesperson said that Pakistan’s foreign secretary was at the 50th Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) being held in Cameroon’s Yaoundé from August 29 to 30. “The foreign secretary will present Pakistan’s perspective on Gaza and Jammu and Kashmir there,” she said, adding that he will also discuss  “terrorism and other global issues” during the session. Baloch added that “Pakistan strongly condemned Israel’s bombing of a historic mosque in Khan Younis”. In May last year, then-foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India to attend the two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Orga­ni­sation’s (SCO) Cou­ncil of Foreign Ministers. He was the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India in almost 12 years. At a Senate panel later that month, Bhutto-Zardari called it a “productive and positive decision” to participate in the event. “As far as the Kashmir issue, bilateral issues between Pakistan and India, and the responsibilities of multilateralism are concerned, my conclusion after the trip is that it is a productive and positive decision to participate in the event,” he said.

  "description": "An 11-month-old baby on Thursday was “accidentally” shot by her father inside their house in Karachi’s Federal B Area, according to the police. Azizabad police Station House Officer (SHO) Imran Afridi told Dawn.com that the baby was killed inside her home in Block 3. SHO Afridi said the police rushed to the spot after receiving the information and detained the father for interrogation. He said that during the initial probe, the father claimed that he was cleaning his pistol when it accidentally discharged, and a bullet hit his infant daughter’s head. The officer said the incident occurred at 3:20am, adding that the police were not satisfied by the suspect’s version of the events. He added that the mother narrated the same story in her video and written statement that an accidental fire had claimed her daughter’s life. The officer said the police were investigating the case while the body was moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities. The proliferation of guns within the country has claimed the lives of many people over the years. At least 95 people were injured and a child was killed as a result of celebratory aerial firing in Karachi on the eve of Independence Day. Earlier this month, a student died after being ‘accidentally’ shot by a pistol at Jamia Farooq-i-Azam in Jhang. In April, a TikToker died when a bullet accidentally hit him in the head while shooting a video clip with a pistol. "

  "description": "KARACHI: A sessions court on Wednesday sentenced a street criminal to a collective of 23 years in prison for committing offences including robbery, possession of illegal arms and an encounter with police. Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Shahid Ali Memon found Javed Jokhio guilty and sentenced him on four counts: seven years each under Sections 397 (robbery) and 324 (attempt to murder), and two years under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The accused was also sentenced to an additional seven years for possession of an illegal weapon under the provision of the Sindh Arms Act 2013, while the court also imposed a fine of Rs20,000. On default, he would serve additional imprisonment. However, the court ruled that all sentences would run concurrently, with the highest sentence being seven years.  Judge rules such offenders do not deserve any leniency  “The current situation of Karachi city, where, many people have lost their lives at the hands of such robbers, who after putting undue pressure rob them in desire of moveable and immovable property, therefore, in the betterment of the society, such offenders do not deserve any leniency and they are liable to be strictly punished in accordance with law, so no other person could commit such kind of offences,” the judge observed.      After pronouncing the verdict, the judge directed the police to take the accused into custody, as he had appeared before the court on bail. According to state prosecutor Syed Khursheed Abbas Bukhari, the complainant informed the police that in September 2021, at midnight, he was on his way to Alladin Park in Gulshan-i-Iqbal. During this time, two individuals on a 125cc motorbike stopped him at gunpoint and snatched his mobile phone and other valuable belongings. However, upon spotting a police mobile, the robbers opened fire. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire, one of the accused, Umair Ali, managed to escape, while the police apprehended the other suspect, Javed Jokhio. During the search, the police recovered a 30-bore pistol and the snatched mobile phone on the spot. During the trial, the prosecution produced three witnesses against the accused to support its case. The state prosecutor argued before the court that the prosecution had brought sufficient oral as well as documentary evidence against the accused beyond any shadow of a doubt and prayed for awarding his conviction. On the other hand, the defence counsel contended that the memo of arrest was made and the case property was sealed at the police station. He claimed the police had booked his client in the bogus case while they also foisted upon his client a fake recovery of a weapon. However, the court rejected the defence plea and noted that the accused neither produced any witness in their support nor brought evidence to prove his innocence. Two separate FIRs were registered at the Aziz Bhatti police station under Sections 397 (Robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 324 (attempt to murder), and 34 (common intention) of the PPC read with Section 23 (i) (a) of the Sindh Arms Act 2013.

Following recent incidents, President Zardari stressed the need for taking all possible steps to improve security situation in Balochistan and called for effective measures for the complete elimination of terrorists.   The newly-appointed Balochistan IGP, Moazzam Jah Ansari, calls on President Asif Ali Zardari, at Aiwan-i-Sadr, on Wednesday.—White Star    The president expressed these views during a meeting with Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti who called on him to discuss a security and law and order situation in the province on Tuesday. Case registered against militants Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Balochistan Police on Wednesday registered a case against unknown militants for killing of 23 passengers in the Rara Shram area of Musakhail district. The case has been registered by CTD of Loralai on behalf of the Station House Officer (SHO) of CTD under Anti-Terrorism Act and other clauses of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the FIR, the SHO of Counter Terrorism Department of Loralai said that on the night of August 25, he heard huge blasts and heavy firing.

  "description": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A senior army officer and his two brothers were kidnapped by suspected militants when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan district, police confirmed on Wednesday. The army officer and his two brothers — one serving in the Cantonment Board Head Office, Rawalpindi, and the other working for the National Database and Registration Authrity (Nadra) — were in a mosque in Mohalla Khadr Khel of Kalachi tehsil receiving people, who had come to condole their father’s demise, when suspected militants came and forcefully took them away. The three officers had come to their ancestral area for funeral prayer of their father that was offered on Tuesday. While Kulachi police confirmed the incident, higher police authorities neither confirmed nor denied it. On August 1, the van of a private security company, carrying Rs40 million, was hijacked by armed suspects within the limits of the Hathala police station in the Kulachi area. The hostages, including guards, driver and crew were later released while the van was set on fire. The robbers fled with the cash. On April 27, District and Sessions Judge South Waziristan Shakir Ullah Marwat was abducted from Dera Ismail Khan-Tank Road near the Kulachi area. However, he returned home soon after the incident.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday hinted at issuing a show cause notice to the city’s chief commissioner over frequent blockages of main roads, saying that the federal capital had apparently turned into a ‘container city’. Chief Justice Aamer Fa­­rooq made these remarks while hearing a contempt plea against the administration for cancelling the “no-objection certificate” issued to the opposition PTI for a public meeting. He noted that in absence of proper arran­gements, office goers suffered on a daily basis, access to the Constitution Avenue from all roads except Margalla Road was blocked. They have to wait in long queues to reach the Constitution Avenue and it takes 40-50 minutes to pass half a kilometre distance, he noted, adding that the capital has virtually closed as the containers are seen everywhere.  Tells Islamabad administration it must inform PTI in advance about any security fears  He questioned as to why district administration blo­cked main roads for one pretext or another and cautioned to summon the chief commissioner if the situation did not improve that according to the chief justi­­ce was ‘not a desirable act’. At the hearing, the counsel for PTI Shoaib Shaheen said the party was expecting that the district administration would not allow any show of power and the NOC was withdrawn at the eleventh hour despite the fact that the district magistrate had submitted an undertaking before the court for permitting the August 22 jalsa. Justice Farooq inqui­red from the Advocate Gene­ral about the reason for ca­­ncelling the NOC, the latter replied that it was withdrawn for law and order situation. The IHC chief justice observed that the country was in a war-like condition, as everyone could witness Balochistan situation. He, however, expres­sed displeasure over the district administration for cancelling the NOC a few hours before the scheduled jalsa. He said those who planned the public gathering were political workers and dignified citizens; they reached the venue from far-flung areas to learn that the event had been cancelled. “You must inform them well in time about any security threats. The party leaders are responsible and they would not put the life of thousands of party workers in danger,” the chief justice said. He also referred to some news reports about the early morning meeting at Adiala Jail that led the party to cancel the jalsa. Permission won’t be withdrawn this time The advocate general informed the court that the district administration had issued the NOC for Sept 8 and assured the court that this time the permission would not be withdrawn. However, Justice Farooq remar­ked that the court would not dispose of this matter and adjourned the proceedings till Sept 10. Published in Dawn, August 29th, 2024 "

  "description": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Wednesday expressed deep concern over the “manipulation” of the province’s youth by certain elements, insisting that young Baloch people were being systematically alienated from the state under a deliberate conspiracy. Speaking at a cheque distribution ceremony for the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Scholarship Programme, organised by the Balochistan Education Endowment Fund (BEEF), Mr Bugti emphasised the importance of making education accessible to alleviate the sense of deprivation in the province. “The provincial government has today realised its education-friendly vision,” he said. “You are the future of Balochistan and Pakistan. I promise you that we will further expand this programme. These children, after receiving a quality education, will serve Balochistan and Pakistan.”  CM vows to uplift young people through expanded scholarship programme  The chief minister highlighted that the programme would provide an excellent educational environment for the children of martyrs, minorities and top-performing students from various districts. The provincial government will facilitate 200 students in pursuing higher education at the world’s leading universities. Moreover, transgender individuals have also been incorporated into the scholarship programme. Mr Bugti also announced the initiation of technical and vocational training schemes aimed at equipping 30,000 young people with practical skills. He also mentioned that interest-free loans are being provided through the Akhuwat programme in easy instalments to help young entrepreneurs start their businesses. Reaffirming his commitment to transparency, Mr Bugti warned that no one would be allowed to sell jobs. “Merit will be upheld at all costs. If anyone demands money for a job, record their video and send it to us; we will take immediate and effective action. Jobs will be strictly on a contract basis to ensure merit and transparency,” he stated. He assured the audience that development projects would continue across every district without discrimination. He promised that the provincial government would keep citizens informed about the progress of these projects, ensuring public access to information. “Democracy is about service deli-very, and we are taking serious steps to resolve public issues by making service delivery efficient,” Mr Bugti emphasised.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Politicians belonging to the ruling coalition as well as the opposition reaffirmed unwavering support to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project on Wednesday, terming it a lifeline for the country’s economy. The speakers made this observation at a mutltiparty moot held at Pakistan-China Institute on Wednesday. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, chairman of the institute, termed ties with China central to Pakistan’s future, saying CPEC has the potential to bring progress and prosperity. The event brought together leaders from eight political parties, including the PML-N, PPP, PTI, MQM and JUI-F. Senator Mushahid highlighted the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) pivotal role in the country’s journey of reform and modernisation, adding that it is the world’s biggest political party with 100 million members. The senator listed five reasons behind China’s success story in a short time: quality of leadership, ability to do course correction, continuity of policy, learning from others, and peaceful foreign policy. Senator Sherry Rehman noted that China had played a crucial role in development of the Global South, and that CPEC had created numerous investment opportunities in Pakistan. She praised Beijing’s Global Security Initiative, calling it a commendable effort that will ensure global peace. The PPP senator also highlighted China’s role in clean energy development under CPEC as a significant contribution to sustainable development in Pakistan and the region. Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, an MNA from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, underscored the enduring strength of Pakistan-China relations, lauding President Xi Jinping’s role in his country’s march to progress. “XI’s leadership has been instrumental in driving China’s remarkable progress on the global stage.” Saadia Khaqan Abbasi commended China’s leadership for ushering in technological advancement, human development and labour productivity. “The focus on security and development is a unique selling point for China,” she added. PTI Senator Shibli Faraz, who is also Leader of the Opposition in the upper house, recounted China’s development story as a role model for the world. He described the BRI as a  symbol of shared development and prosperity. “CPEC stands as a beacon of hope for Pakistanis, symbolising the transformative impact of our strong bilateral relationship.” Senator Afrasiab Khattak of the National Democratic Movement said the Communist Party of China is more than just a political party; it is a popular ruling force that has steered China towards unprecedented development. “Pakistan must learn from China, do a course correction and become a frontline state in economic development, focusing on geoeconomics rather than being a frontline state in conflicts.” Senator Jan Muhammad Jamali said Balochistan’s future is inextricably interconnected with the country’s development goals and the past must not “impede CPEC at any cost”. Shezra Mansab Ali, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reaffirmed Islamabad’s unwavering support for the One-China policy and respect for China’s unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty. “China has consistently supported Pakistan on core issues, including the Kashmir dispute.” Senator Jan Muhammad Buledi, a leader of the National Party, emphasised the importance of enhancing collaboration between Balochistan’s universities and their Chinese counterparts. Senator Abdul Qadir, a leader of the Balochistan Awami Party, pinpointed the wealth of knowledge and experience that Pakistan can gain from China’s success story. “Pakistan can learn a great deal from China’s experience, especially in areas like economic development, infrastructure, and governance.” MQM’s Taha Ahmed highlighted the strategic importance of Karachi as Pakistan’s business hub thanks to its proximity to CPEC.  “Karachi is not only the country’s business hub but also holds critical importance due to its close ties with the CPEC route,” Taha Khan stated. Senator Ali Zafar of the PTI praised the Communist Party of China for maintaining continuity of policy and for its principle of “seeking truth from fact”. Trailblazer Yang Nuo, Minister-Counsellor at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, emphasised the importance of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee held last month, describing it as a trailblazer for China’s future. “This session serves as a blueprint for further reforms in China, setting the stage for continued progress and development.” Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, in his closing remarks highlighted China’s consensus-oriented decision-making process. “In China, decisions are made through a consensus-driven approach, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered, which contributes to their effective governance,” he observed.

  "description": "PESHAWAR/TOBA TEK SINGH: The Khyber Pahtunkhwa government has sought action against Punjab officials for failing to provide security to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, an official letter read. The KP government, in the letter to the principal secretary to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, reques­ted for an inquiry over the negligence during Mr Gan­­­dapur’s visit to Fai­­salabad. The document, a copy of which is available with Dawn, read that Mr Gandapur was scheduled to visit district Faisalabad and the chief minister’s visit was properly intimated by Mr Gandapur’s security staff to the police officials concerned, followed by an interaction over the phone with the relevant SSP operations. However, it added, no security arrangements were made during the CM’s visit. “You would appreciate that these protocols are for the safety of all VVIPs and VIPs across Pakistan, so provided for in the blue book as well the norms and are critical to avoid any untoward incidents,” the letter read. “Such inaction of not providing security unilaterally may lead to a rethink,” it read. The letter requested principal secretary to the Punjab CM to bring the issue into her notice and initiate an inquiry into the circumstances, which caused the deviation from the set protocols. Earlier on Wednesday, an anti-terrorism court of Faisalabad granted bail to Mr Gandapur in four May 9 cases until Sept 12. The cases were registered against him over his alleged role in the riots in Faisalabad following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in 2023. PTI lawyer Khalid Sha­fiq told the media Mr Gan­dapur had come to join the investigations, but all five JIT members were absent. Published in Dawn, August 29th, 2024 "

  "content": "Widespread rains along with windstorms are likely to hit most parts of the country during the next 24 hours, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Thursday. In a statement, the Met Office said heavy rainfall is likely in Sindh, northeast/south Balochistan, northeast/central Punjab, Potohar region, Islamabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Kashmir during the said period. As per synoptic situation, deep depression was present over Rann of Kutch, India and lies at a distance of 270km east/southeast of Karachi, and likely to intensify into a Cyclonic storm during next 24 hours. A westerly wave was also affecting upper parts of the country. “Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy-very heavy to isolated extremely heavy falls likely in Tharparker, Badin, Thatta, Sajawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allah Yar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts and Karachi division till August 31 with occasional gaps,” it added. The PMD also warned that torrential rains may generate pluvial flood/inundation in low lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab till August 31. Torrential rains may generate flash flooding in hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and local nullahs/streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbela. Heavy rains may trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy downpour may also cause urban flooding in low lying areas of Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan, Sahiwal, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Nowshera, Swabi and Peshawar. During the last 24 hours, rain-wind/thundershower with isolated heavyfall occurred in Sindh, upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Punjab, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and northeast Balochistan. The highest maximum temperatures recorded were Sibbi 43C, Dalbandin and Turbat 41C. Earlier in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that a severe low pressure system over the Arabian Sea is likely to transform into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours. PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz indicated that if the low-pressure system does develop into a cyclonic storm, it will be named \"Asna\", which means \"highest\" and \"brighter\". A cyclonic storm during the monsoon season is very unusual, Sarfaraz said, noting that this is the first time since 1961 that such a weather system is directed towards Sindh's coastal belt from Central India. \"During monsoon, there is approximately 1% or 2% chance for a depression or low pressure to turn into a cyclonic storm or tropical cyclone.\" meteorologist Anjum Nazir told Geo News."

  "content": "KARACHI: Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Ali Naqvi has announced the closure of all public and private schools in Karachi tomorrow (Friday) following the prediction of heavy rain.   In a statement, the Karachi commissioner said the decision has been taken after consulting the Met Office and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). The development came as Karachi has been experiencing intermittent rainfall since Wednesday with the heavy rain expected to lash the metropolis in the next few hours. The strong monsoon system near Tharparkar and India’s Rann of Kutch may penetrate into Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts, bringing torrential rains with thunderstorm, the Met Office said on Wednesday. It had said Karachi was likely to receive from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain in the next three days. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of intermittent rain in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, until August 31, with strong winds and thunderstorms, and heavy downpours in some places. Speaking during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', PMD Meteorologist Anjum Nazir Zaighum said a strong weather system was still present 270 km away from Karachi in the north-east. “The weather system will increase its intensity marginally, when it will reach the Arabian Sea, and form a cyclone storm for about one and a half days,” he warned. In the Arabian Sea, Zaigham maintained, an average cyclone lasted for three to four days. The weather department, in its daily report, said wind was blowing at a speed of 13km from south-western side in the port city. Meanwhile, schools in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal, Badin, Tandwalayar, Sanghar will remain closed on Friday, owing to the rain forecast. "

  "content": "Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch confirmed on Thursday that Pakistan has formally invited all heads of government of the the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting in Islamabad. Baloch, addressing a weekly news briefing in the federal capital, said that Islamabad has also received some confirmations for the upcoming SCO moot to be hosted by Pakistan on October 15-16. Responding to a question, Baloch said Pakistan does not have trade relations with India. The official confirmation regarding Islamabad's invitations to the heads of the SCO member states came two days after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that Pakistan would certainly invite PM Modi to the regional summit. Asif also said the host country could not pick and choose about inviting the heads of state, adding that not extending an invitation to any member state was inappropriate and the SCO would not accept any such move by any host member state. Earlier this week, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had denied the media reports suggesting that PM Modi would not attend the upcoming SCO summit in Pakistan and urged media outlets to refrain from speculating on the matter. The MEA's statement emphasised India's position that no official decision had been made regarding the prime minister’s participation in the SCO meeting in Pakistan. The South Asian nations have a history of strained ties, particularly due to the longstanding Kashmir dispute. The FO spokesperson said Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognised disputed territory. She said the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions clearly state that the final disposition of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute shall be made in accordance with the will of the people through a UN-supervised plebiscite. In this backdrop, Baloch said that any other process cannot serve as a substitute for granting the right of self-determination to the Kashmiri people. Responding to another query, Baloch said Pakistan has no plans to engage in any talks with the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). She said the presence of terror groups including the TTP in Afghanistan is confirmed by multiple international reports including the United Nations (UN). \"We expect the Afghan authorities to take robust action against these terror groups and prevent their activities that endanger Pakistan's security,\" she added. The spokesperson reiterated Islamabad’s stance given on the matter last month in which the country ruled out any dialogue with the militant outfit, saying that dialogues are not possible with elements involved in the killings of Pakistanis and foreigners. The federal government has taken a tough stance after witnessing a surge in terrorist attacks and launched a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism drive, Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability), in June to turn up the heat on militants targeting the state. When asked about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the spokesperson said: \"It is a transformational project that has contributed positively and transparently to Pakistan's national development.\" She further said that the CPEC project enjoys support and popularity in all provinces and across the political divide in Pakistan. The FO spokesperson clarified that Pakistan's total public debt relating to CPEC projects is a small percentage of its total debt. Moreover, she said, the public debt obtained from China has longer maturity periods with low interest rates. She reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to provide full security to all Chinese nationals, projects and institutions."

  "content": "QUETTA: Days after dozens of people lost their lives in horrific attacks in Balochistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday visited the provincial capital and pledged the government’s unwavering resolve to root out the menace of terrorism with collective efforts. “The blood of our will not go in vain,” the premier said while addressing a high-level meeting of National Action Plan’s provincial Apex Committee at CM Secretariat, Quetta. The meeting was attended by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, security czar Mohsin Naqvi, federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Attaullah Tarar, Jam Kamal, corps commander, and other armed and civilian officials were in attendance. The prime minister's visit to Quetta comes against the backdrop of recent bloodshed in the country's largest province by land wherein over 50 people, including 14 security personnel, were martyred in different terrorist attacks in Balochistan. In one of the deadliest attacks on Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy. Speaking during the meeting today, the prime minister expressed his profound grief over the loss of precious lives and said: “It was an extremely tragic and barbaric incident that caused a wave of grief across Pakistan.”    He noted that all terrorist organisations, the \"Khawarij\" and facilitators hatched the terror plot which resulted in martyrdom of innocent civilians and security personnel. “The entire nation is grieved by the recent tragic incident occurred in Balochistan. Khawarij who shed the blood of innocent people will be crushed through joint efforts of the nation and the valiant forces of Pakistan,” he said. Balochistan is an important and beautiful province of Pakistan, the premier noted, saying that all obstacles in its path to development and prosperity will be removed for good. PM Shehbaz noted that terrorism had reared its head again after 2018, reiterating the government’s determination to crush those involved in the ghastly bloodshed. Expressing his great trust in the professional capabilities of the armed and civilian forces, he said under the guidance of COAS General Munir, and with full cooperation from the federal government and the leadership of Balochistan, the terrorism will be rooted out. “Sacrifices of those who laid down their lives for the motherland and the innocent civilians will not go to waste”, the PM further remarked. The prime minister stated that enemies of Pakistan want to hinder the progress of Balochistan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but “will not be succeeded”.  He also emphasised the need for collective efforts to eliminate terrorism from the province, ruling out any dialogue with the terrorists.  He added that eradication of terrorism was essential for the country’s prosperity. However, the premier said, talks should be held with those elements who believe in the Constitution and flag of Pakistan.  Furthermore, he noted that the government has chalked out a policy regarding appointment of “competent and talented officers” in Balochistan.  PM Shehbaz announced that 48 Common Training Programme officers will be deployed in the province for a year. “Half of the officers will be deployed immediately and remaining after six months,” he added.  He further announced incentives for officers deployed in the province, including air tickets for their families after every three months and additional three points for performance-based evaluations.  He also assured that the policy will be implemented in consultation with the Balochistan government. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan."

  "content": "KARACHI: A severe low-pressure system over the Arabian Sea, which is expected to escalate into a cyclonic storm, is likely to hit Sindh's coastal belt within the next 24 hours, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said Thursday. According to PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz, if the low-pressure system develops into a cyclonic storm, it will be named \"Asna\", which means \"highest\" and \"brighter\". He emphasised that a cyclonic storm during the monsoon season is \"very unusual\", highlighting that this is the first occurrence of such a weather system directed toward the Sindh coastal belt from Central India since 1961. \"During monsoon, there is approximately 1% or 2% chance for a depression or low pressure to turn into a cyclonic storm or tropical cyclone.\" meteorologist Anjum Nazir said. Earlier today, the PMD reported that a deep depression over India's Rann of Kutch, situated 270km east/southeast of Karachi, is expected to intensify into a cyclonic storm later tonight or by tomorrow (Friday) morning if it gets favourable weather conditions. The Met Office expects the possible storm and weather system to bring heavy rains to Pakistan's coastal belt, including lower Sindh and Karachi. As a result, PMD's cyclone warning centre in the port city has also warned fishermen in lower Sindh and Balochistan to avoid venturing to the sea till August 31 in view of a possible cyclone. This system is also likely to bring scattered heavy rainfall to isolated extremely heavy rainfall in Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sajawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allah Yar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts and Karachi till August 31 with occasional gaps. Such torrential rains may trigger pluvial floods or inundation in low-lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. It may also cause flash flooding in hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and local nullahs and streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbella. Heavy rains may also trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Issuing an alert to relevant departments, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) anticipated more \"heavy to very heavy rain\" clubbed with wind/thunderstorms in parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan within the next 24 to 72 hours. Rainfall is likely to exceed 100mm in most parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, a statement read, adding that heavy downpours are expected to trigger urban flooding in urban centre, including Karachi and Hyderabad, as well as flash flooding in local nullahs and river tributaries. It also predicted heavy rainfall in Punjab and Balochistan that could cause urban flooding in urban centres, floods in hill torrents in both provinces and high river flows. The NDMA urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains. It issued instructions to alert Emergency Response Teams and mobilise resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations.  The public is advised to remain vigilant and follow instructions from local authorities."

  "content": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday conferred Hilal-e-Imtiaz, the second-highest civilian award of the country, on Olympian Arshad Nadeem for winning the country's first gold medal in 40 years in the recently concluded Paris 2024 Olympics. He won Pakistan’s first athletic gold medal with an Olympic record-breaking feat in the men's javelin throw competition. President Zardari bestowed the award on him during a ceremony at the President House in Islamabad. The President also announced a Rs100 million reward from his side for the athlete.   Later, the athlete also called on President Zardari. The athlete's coach Salman Iqbal Butt, Secretary Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, Nadeem Irshad Kayani, Director General Pakistan Sports Board, Yasir Pirzada, and senior government officials also attended the meeting. Congratulating the star javelin thrower, Zardari stated that he made the country proud by setting the Olympic record with a throw of 92.97 metres.  He appreciated his remarkable achievement, hard work, and dedication that not only elevated the country but also inspired countless young athletes across the country.  The 40-year drought of a gold medal in the Olympics for Pakistan ended with the javelin thrower’s achievement, despite his long struggle with lack of facilities, equipment and training. Nadeem broke the Olympic record with 92.97 meters throw. Over this achievement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on August 13 had announced to grant him Hilal-e-Imtiaz. Nadeem has been showered with rewards since his victory on August 8, the day he claimed the gold. PM Shehbaz hosted a lavish dinner for the ace javelin thrower and announced a prize of Rs150 million. Disclosing his plans for the 2028 Olympics, the prime minister announced to establish a training centre inside the Jinnah Stadium in Islamabad, which will be named \"Arshad Nadeem High Performance Academy\". Separately, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif presented a cheque of Rs100 million and a key of a car with a number plate \"PAK 92.97\" to the Olympian. While the Sindh government had given him a prize money of Rs50 million. Several other private and government entities granted him cash prizes and other rewards for his making the nation proud on the world athletes map."

  "content": "Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday reiterated Pakistan’s call for the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to take urgent steps to put an end to the genocide of Palestinian people and halt Israel’s flagrant breaches of international laws and the UN Charter. Addressing media in Islamabad, the FO spokesperson said Israel's continuous violations of international humanitarian law included airstrikes and drone operations on civilian areas, over which it should be held accountable for war crimes. Israeli forces' indiscriminate strikes in just the Gaza Strip has killed more than 40,534 people and injured about 94,000 others since October 2023. Meanwhile, Baloch also expressed country’s grave concerns over the fresh large-scale military incursion by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. She said the attack was another blatant violation of international law, including the 4th Geneva Convention, which prohibited indiscriminate targeting of civilians. Israel launched a large-scale operation Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, killing at least 11 Palestinians, as the nearly 11-month-old Gaza war showed no signs of abating.  Children were among those killed, according to the United Nations, while Hamas said the fatalities included three members of its armed wing in the Jenin refugee camp. The spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s strong condemnation of the bombing of the historic Grand Mosque in Khan Younis by Israeli forces, and said the assault on a place of deep cultural and religious significance was a clear violation of international laws and the Hague Convention. Highlighting the diplomatic engagements during this week, she mentioned Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi’s visit to Cameroon where he is leading a Pakistani delegation at the 50th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFMs). At the CFMs, he would share Pakistan’s perspective on genocide in Gaza, dire humanitarian situation and Israeli adventurism in the region threatening regional peace. He will also highlight the Indian atrocities in IIOJK, the issues of Islamophobia and climate change. Meanwhile, the eighth session of the Pakistan-Oman Bilateral Political Consultations was held in Muscat, Oman earlier this week.  The talks were co-chaired by Additional Foreign Secretary (Middle East), Ambassador Shehryar Akbar Khan and Ambassador Sheikh Ahmad bin Hashil bin Rashid Al Maskari, the Chief of GCC and Regional Neighborhood Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman. The two sides comprehensively reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and Oman including political relations, trade and investment, security and defence, culture, health and consular matters.  The two sides also expressed serious concerns on Israel’s war on Gaza and the genocide of the Palestinian people. They stressed the need for an urgent and unconditional ceasefire and reiterated the call for the creation of a viable, sovereign and contiguous Palestinian State."

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday landed in Quetta after recent attacks in Balochistan which saw more than two dozen people being martyred in various terrorist incidents. During his one-day visit, the prime minister is scheduled to chair a high-level meeting on the security, law and order situation. The premier is accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.   On Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel.

Meanwhile, Federal Interior Minister Naqvi, while on his visit to Quetta on the same day, had underscored the need to \"go after\" those who were backing these incidents. The Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial administration has vowed stern action against the terrorists to avenge the killings \"without launching any grand operation. \"The state will establish its writ and take all necessary steps. We are ready for dialogue but with whom should we hold talks? Should we hold talks with those who killed innocent labourers?\" the CM had said while addressing a press conference in the provincial capital earlier this week. \"Innocent people were martyred after being offloaded from buses. Revenge will be taken from the terrorists. These activities were not carried out by disgruntled Balochs but terrorists who always search for soft targets,\" he added."

  "content": "As Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) continues to face both internal and external challenges, former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) minister Shaukat Yousafzai has dismissed claims suggesting that the party was \"disturbed\" over its founder Imran Khan's incarceration. Speaking on Geo News' programme \"Geo Pakistan\" on Thursday, Yousafzai said: \"There is no substance in rumours suggesting that the PTI was disturbed due to Imran Khan's incarceration [...] the PTI's vote bank isn't going anywhere.\" The rebuttal comes against the backdrop of reports suggesting tug-of-war among its leadership on issues ranging from corruption and bad governance in KP under Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to the party leadership's inability to hold a public rally. The party's founder and former prime minister, who was removed from power via a parliamentary vote in April 2022, has been behind bars for more than a year as well as several other key leaders such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi are either behind bars or in hiding owing to the nationwide crackdown launched against the party after the last year's May 9 riots. Earlier this month, Khan had summoned PTI's KP leaders Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar for a meeting at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail after the duo voiced support for former KP minister for communication and works Shakeel Ahmad who had stepped down over alleged corruption and bad governance by the CM Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province. Another issue the party faces is its inability to hold a major powershow as reflected in the Islamabad rally saga which has been dragging on for months with the local administration time again denying or revoking permission for a rally in the federal capital. Last week, the PTI put off its public gathering in Islamabad and rescheduled it for September 8 with Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan saying that the powershow was postponed following a party leadership's meeting with Imran Khan in Adiala jail. Gohar along with National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub claimed that the rally was rescheduled on Khan's instructions. The postponement of the Islamabad rally didn't sit well with Aleema Khan, the PTI founder's sister, who expressed a lack of confidence in the current leadership and said that they had no \"real intention\" of freeing the former prime minister from jail. Speaking on the alleged rift between party leadership, Yousafzai said that there were no differences within the party and that action was taken against PTI members in accordance with the party's discipline guidelines. \"Atif Khan has not been expelled from the party [....] KP CM Gandapur is doing alright in light of the fact that we have to run our campaign while the founder is in jail,\" the former provincial minister said. \"The KP chief minister has been given a task by assigning him the said post,\" he added. Reiterating that the party will \"definitely\" hold the September 8 rally in Islamabad, the PTI leader said that the biggest success of the party has been keeping its workers charged. It is to be noted that Islamabad Advocate General Ayyaz Shaukat has assured the party of granting permission to hold its rally in the federal capital on the said date, The News reported on Thursday. Touching upon the party's leaders who were in hiding, he said that he couldn't say anything about them. \"I don't know anything about Murad Saeed,\" he said while referring to the whereabouts of the former minister who has been in hiding since last year."

  "content": "Forecast of heavy monsoon downpours and flooding have forced various district administrations of Sindh to announce closure of educational institutes in their respective jurisdictions on Thursday with the Sindh Education Department temporarily delegating powers to deputy commissioners (DCs) in this regard.  In a letter to district administrations, the provincial education department has authorised deputy commissioners to declare holidays in local schools, owing to the ongoing monsoon season, which is likely to prevail for few more days.  The department said the decision could be taken viewing the heavy rains and damages in the relevant districts. Hence, exercising the powers, deputy commissioners of Tando Allahyar, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Sajawal, Jamshoro and Umarkot have announced holiday for all private and public educational institutes in their respective jurisdictions on Thursday. The DCs of Nawabshah and Jamshoro have ordered for closure of schools for the remaining three days of this week, while the Umarkot DC directed to shut down schools for two days.

  "content": "An earthquake Thursday jolted Islamabad and cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meanwhile, the KP cities rocked by the quake tremors include Peshawar, Swat, North Waziristan, Hangu, Mardan, Malakand, Buner, Shangla, Dir, Mansehra, Bitgram, Torghar, Kohistan Abbottabad and Kurram. The tremors have also been felt in Punjab cities including Lahore, Multan, Chakwal and Sargodha.   The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that the earthquake originated at 10:57am Pakistan Standard Time (PST) and had a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale. The epicentre of the quake, the Met Office added, was in the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan at a depth of 215 kilometres. Today's tremors come nearly two months after a 4.7 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and KP in June. The quake was preceded by another one of 3.2 magnitude in Karachi in the same month. In May, a 2.3 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the metropolis including Gadap Town, Katohar and adjoining areas of Malir district. Before that, a 3.2 magnitude earthquake jolted Karachi's Malir district on April 24. It is pertinent to mention that earthquakes are not uncommon in Pakistan, as the country is situated on the boundary of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Large parts of South Asia are seismically active because a tectonic plate known as the Indian plate is pushing north into the Eurasian plate."

  "content": "KARACHI: The Met Office on Thursday said Karachi and other parts of Sindh were expected to witness heavy downpour as a strong monsoon system would reach the Arabian Sea in the evening.  The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said the weather system, hovering near Tharparkar and India’s Rann of Kutch, might enter Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts of the province in the evening, bringing thunderstorm and severe rains.  The weather department added that between 150 millimeters to 200 millimeters rain may be experienced in Karachi in the next three days. There is a possibility of intermittent rain in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, until August 31, with strong winds and thunderstorms, and heavy downpours in some places, the Met Office said. Speaking during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', PMD Meteorologist Anjum Nazir Zaighum said a strong weather system was still present 270 km away from Karachi in the north-east.  \"The weather system will increase its intensity marginally, when it will reach the Arabian Sea, and form a cyclone storm for about one and a half days,\" he warned. In the Arabian Sea, Zaigham maintained, an average cyclone lasted for three to four days.  The weather department, in its daily report, said wind was blowing at a speed of 13km from south-western side in the port city.  While, humidity level in the air was recorded 88% and the minimum temperature was 26°C. The mercury may maximum clock at 30°C.  Meanwhile, schools in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal, Badin, Tandwalayar, Sanghar will remain closed on Friday, owing to the rain forecast.  On the other hand, all schools in Karachi will remain open as the notification of holiday in schools of district Central has also been withdrawn.  In the last 24 hours, the PMD said, Karachi’s Surjani Town received the highest amount of rain, 30mm. Nazimabad recorded 26mm of rain, Keamari 21mm, Gulshan-e-Hadeed 16mm, Faisal Base 16mm, Quaidabad 11.5mm, Orangi Town 13.1mm, Saddar 13mm, North Karachi 12.2mm, Saddar 11mm, Sharea Faisal 10mm, University Road 9mm, Gulshan-e-Maymar 11.1mm, Old Airport 11.6mm, Mauripur 8mm, Jinnah Terminal 9.6mm, Masroor Base 9mm, Korangi 8.2mm, DHA 7.8 mm and Gadap 3.7mm during this time. Issuing an alert to relevant departments, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) anticipated more \"heavy to very heavy rain\" clubbed with wind/thunderstorms in parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan within the next 24 to 72 hours. Rainfall is likely to exceed 100mm in most parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, a statement read, adding that heavy downpours are expected to trigger urban flooding in urban centre, including Karachi and Hyderabad, as well as flash flooding in local nullahs and river tributaries. It also predicted heavy rainfall in Punjab and Balochistan that could cause urban flooding in urban centres, floods in hill torrents in both provinces and high river flows. The NDMA urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains. It issued instructions to alert Emergency Response Teams and mobilise resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations.  The public is advised to remain vigilant and follow instructions from local authorities."

  "content": "The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday forecast more widespread rain with windstorm in all across the country during the next 24 hours. In a statement, the Met Office said heavy rainfall is likely in Sindh, northeast/south Balochistan, northeast/central Punjab, Potohar region, Islamabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Kashmir during the said period. As per synoptic situation, deep depression was present over Rann of Kutch, India and lies at a distance of 270km east/southeast of Karachi, and likely to intensify into a Cyclonic storm during next 24 hours.  A westerly wave was also affecting upper parts of the country. “Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy-very heavy to isolated extremely heavy falls likely in Tharparker, Badin, Thatta, Sajawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allah Yar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts and Karachi division till August 31 with occasional gaps,” it added.  The PMD also warned that torrential rains may generate pluvial flood/inundation in low lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab till August 31. Torrential rains may generate flash flooding in hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and local nullahs/streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbela. Heavy rains may trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy downpour may also cause urban flooding in low lying areas of Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan, Sahiwal, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Nowshera, Swabi and Peshawar. During the last 24 hours, rain-wind/thundershower with isolated heavyfall occurred in Sindh, upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Punjab, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and northeast Balochistan. The highest maximum temperatures recorded were Sibbi 43C, Dalbandin and Turbat 41C. Earlier in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that a severe low pressure system over the Arabian Sea is likely to transform into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours. PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz indicated that if the low-pressure system does develop into a cyclonic storm, it will be named \"Asna\", which means \"highest\" and \"brighter\". A cyclonic storm during the monsoon season is very unusual, Sarfaraz said, noting that this is the first time since 1961 that such a weather system is directed towards Sindh's coastal belt from Central India. \"During monsoon, there is approximately 1% or 2% chance for a depression or low pressure to turn into a cyclonic storm or tropical cyclone.\" meteorologist Anjum Nazir told Geo News."

  "content": "  Pakistan has extended invitations to all heads of government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting in Islamabad, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said on Thursday. Baloch, addressing a weekly news briefing in the federal capital, said that Islamabad has also received some confirmations for the upcoming SCO moot to be hosted by Pakistan on October 15-16. Responding to a question, Baloch said Pakistan does not have trade relations with India. The official confirmation regarding Islamabad's invitations to the heads of the SCO member states came two days after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that Pakistan would certainly invite PM Modi to the regional summit. Asif also said the host country could not pick and choose about inviting the heads of state, adding that not extending an invitation to any member state was inappropriate and the SCO would not accept any such move by any host member state. Earlier this week, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had denied the media reports suggesting that PM Modi would not attend the upcoming SCO summit in Pakistan and urged media outlets to refrain from speculating on the matter. The MEA's statement emphasised India's position that no official decision had been made regarding the prime minister’s participation in the SCO meeting in Pakistan. The South Asian nations have a history of strained ties, particularly due to the longstanding Kashmir dispute. The FO spokesperson said Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognised disputed territory. She said the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions clearly state that the final disposition of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute shall be made in accordance with the will of the people through a UN-supervised plebiscite. In this backdrop, Baloch said that any other process cannot serve as a substitute for granting the right of self-determination to the Kashmiri people. Responding to another query, Baloch said Pakistan has no plans to engage in any talks with the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). She said the presence of terror groups including the TTP in Afghanistan is confirmed by multiple international reports including the United Nations (UN). \"We expect the Afghan authorities to take robust action against these terror groups and prevent their activities that endanger Pakistan's security,\" she added. The spokesperson reiterated Islamabad’s stance given on the matter last month in which the country ruled out any dialogue with the militant outfit, saying that dialogues are not possible with elements involved in the killings of Pakistanis and foreigners. The federal government has taken a tough stance after witnessing a surge in terrorist attacks and launched a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism drive, Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability), in June to turn up the heat on militants targeting the state.  When asked about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the spokesperson said: \"It is a transformational project that has contributed positively and transparently to Pakistan's national development.\" She further said that the CPEC project enjoys support and popularity in all provinces and across the political divide in Pakistan. The FO spokesperson clarified that Pakistan's total public debt relating to CPEC projects is a small percentage of its total debt. Moreover, she said, the public debt obtained from China has longer maturity periods with low interest rates. She reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to provide full security to all Chinese nationals, projects and institutions."

  "content": "QUETTA: In response to a series of horrific attacks in Balochistan that resulted in over 50 deaths, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the provincial capital on Thursday and vowed to completely eradicate terrorism from the province at all costs, saying the \"blood of martyrs will not go in vain\". The premier made these remarks while chairing a high-level meeting of the National Action Plan’s provincial apex committee.  Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, security czar Mohsin Naqvi, federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Attaullah Tarar, Jam Kamal, corps commander , and other armed and civilian officials were in attendance. The prime minister's visit to Quetta comes against the backdrop of recent bloodshed in the country's largest province by land wherein over 50 people, including 14 security personnel, were martyred in different terrorist attacks in Balochistan. In one of the deadliest attacks on Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy. Terming the incidents “tragic and barbaric” today, the prime minister said all terrorist organisations, the \"Khawarij\" and facilitators hatched the terror plot which resulted in martyrdom of innocent civilians and security personnel.    “The entire nation is grieved by the recent tragic incident occurred in Balochistan. Khawarij who shed the blood of innocent people will be crushed through joint efforts of the nation and the valiant forces of Pakistan,” he said. Balochistan is an important and beautiful province of Pakistan, the premier noted, saying that all obstacles in its path to development and prosperity will be removed for good. PM Shehbaz noted that terrorism had reared its head again after 2018, reiterating the government’s determination to crush those involved in the ghastly bloodshed.  Expressing his great trust in the professional capabilities of the armed and civilian forces, he said under the guidance of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, and with full cooperation from the federal government and the leadership of Balochistan, the terrorism will be rooted out. “Sacrifices of those who laid down their lives for the motherland and the innocent civilians will not go to waste”, the PM further remarked.  The prime minister stated that enemies of Pakistan want to hinder the progress of Balochistan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but “will not be succeeded”.  He also emphasised the need for collective efforts to eliminate terrorism from the province, ruling out any dialogue with the terrorists.  He added that eradication of terrorism was essential for the country’s prosperity. However, the premier said, talks should be held with those elements who believe in the Constitution and flag of Pakistan.  Furthermore, he noted that the government has chalked out a policy regarding appointment of “competent and talented officers” in Balochistan.  PM Shehbaz announced that 48 Common Training Programme officers will be deployed in the province for a year. “Half of the officers will be deployed immediately and remaining after six months,” he added.  He further announced incentives for officers deployed in the province, including air tickets for their families after every three months and additional three points for performance-based evaluations.  He also assured that the policy will be implemented in consultation with the Balochistan government. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan."

  "content": "Pakistan on Thursday expressed grave concerns over the fresh large-scale military incursion by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. At her weekly press briefing in Islamabad, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the attack was another blatant violation of international law, including the 4th Geneva Convention, which prohibited indiscriminate targeting of civilians. Israel launched a large-scale operation Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, killing at least 11 Palestinians, as the nearly 11-month-old Gaza war showed no signs of abating. Children were among those killed, according to the United Nations, while Hamas said the fatalities included three members of its armed wing in the Jenin refugee camp. The FO spokesperson reiterated the country’s call for the UN Security Council to take immediate measures to stop the genocide of Palestinian people, end Israel’s blatant violations of international laws and the UN Charter, and hold it accountable for war crimes. She said that the repeated Israeli transgressions and the use of force, including airstrikes and drone attacks on populated areas was a blatant violation of the international humanitarian laws. The spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s strong condemnation of the bombing of the historic Grand Mosque in Khan Younis by Israeli forces, and said the assault on a place of deep cultural and religious significance was a clear violation of international laws and the Hague Convention. Highlighting the diplomatic engagements during the last week, she mentioned Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi’s visit to Cameroon where he was leading a Pakistani delegation at the 50th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFMs). At the CFMs, he would share Pakistan’s perspective on genocide in Gaza, dire humanitarian situation and Israeli adventurism in the region threatening regional peace. He will also highlight the atrocities being committed by India in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), the issues of Islamophobia and climate change."

  "content": " KARACHI: Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab has urged the citizens to avoid “unnecessary movement” as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted heavy rains in the metropolis due to a potential cyclone that is likely to emerge along the Sindh coast late by tomorrow (Friday) morning. Taking to X, Murtaza pointed out that it has been raining since last three days and in the next few hours, it is expected that \"there will be heavier rainfall with strong winds\".  \"I would urge the residents of Karachi especially bike riders to avoid unnecessary movement. Stay safe everyone & in case of any emergency call 1339,\" he wrote. According to an alert issued by the Met Office on Thursday night, the deep depression or very strong low-pressure area over Rann of Kutch, India has slowly moved west/southwestward during last 12 hours and now lies at around Latitude 23.6 N & Longitude 69.2 E at about 250km east/southeast of Karachi.  “The system is likely keep moving further west/southwestwards, emerge into northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh coast by tomorrow (Friday) morning and intensify further into a Cyclonic Storm (CS) due to favorable environmental conditions, sea surface temperature, low/moderate vertical wind shear and upper-level divergence,” it stated.

Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorm with scattered heavy/very heavy falls also likely in Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Keach & Gwadar districts during 30 August to 1st September with occasional gaps, read the statement.  Such torrential rains may trigger pluvial flood or inundation in low lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. It may also cause flash flooding in hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and local nullahs and streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbella.  Heavy rains may also trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. “Sea conditions are likely to remain rough/very rough with squally winds 50-60 km/hour gusting 70 km/hour,” it said, advising the fishermen of Sindh not to venture into sea till 31 August and those of Balochistan till 1st September. The Met Office noted that PMD’s cyclone warning center, Karachi is closely monitoring the system and will issue the update accordingly. “The concerned authorities are requested to keep them abreast through PMD advisory.” Earlier today, PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz indicated that if the low-pressure system does develop into a cyclonic storm, it will be named \"Asna\", which means \"highest\" and \"brighter\". A cyclonic storm during the monsoon season is very unusual, Sarfaraz said, noting that this is the first time since 1961 that such a weather system is directed towards Sindh's coastal belt from Central India. \"During monsoon, there is approximately 1% or 2% chance for a depression or low pressure to turn into a cyclonic storm or tropical cyclone.\" meteorologist Anjum Nazir told Geo News. In light of the cyclone alert issued by the PMD and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) today, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has instructed all relevant departments, including the administration and the municipal bodies, to heighten their responsiveness to potential disasters. Additionally, all hospitals have been directed to enhance their management and ensure the attendance of their staff. Furthermore, the chief minister also directed the Fisheries department to issue instructions for fishermen and ordered the Irrigation department to monitor the dams of rivers, canals and other water passages. Issuing an alert to relevant departments, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) anticipated more \"heavy to very heavy rain\" clubbed with wind/thunderstorms in parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan within the next 24 to 72 hours. Rainfall is likely to exceed 100mm in most parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, a statement read, adding that heavy downpours are expected to trigger urban flooding in urban centre, including Karachi and Hyderabad, as well as flash flooding in local nullahs and river tributaries. It also predicted heavy rainfall in Punjab and Balochistan that could cause urban flooding in urban centres, floods in hill torrents in both provinces and high river flows. The NDMA urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains. It issued instructions to alert Emergency Response Teams and mobilise resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. The public is advised to remain vigilant and follow instructions from local authorities."

  "content": " Days after dozens of people lost their lives in various terrorist attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday landed in Quetta on a one-day visit to review the security, law and order situation in the province. The premier, accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, will chair a high-level meeting on the security, law and order situation during his visit. The prime minister's visit comes against the backdrop of recent bloodshed in the country's largest province by land wherein at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorist attacks in Balochistan.   On Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations — launched after at least 37 people were martyred in different terrorist incidents — wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy. \"Doors of negotiations are open [only] for those who recognise the Constitution and flag of Pakistan, but there is no room for terrorists,” the premier said while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Federal Interior Minister Naqvi, while on his visit to Quetta on the same day, had underscored the need to \"go after\" those who were backing these incidents. The Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial administration has vowed stern action against the terrorists to avenge the killings \"without launching any grand operation. \"The state will establish its writ and take all necessary steps. We are ready for dialogue but with whom should we hold talks? Should we hold talks with those who killed innocent labourers?\" the CM had said while addressing a press conference in the provincial capital earlier this week. \"Innocent people were martyred after being offloaded from buses. Revenge will be taken from the terrorists. These activities were not carried out by disgruntled Balochs but terrorists who always search for soft targets,\" he added."

  "content": "LAHORE: The National Assembly has been informed that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) is using the controversial Web Monitoring System (WMS) to block online applications and websites in Pakistan. The minister in charge for the cabinet division, a division that has administrative control over the PTA, was questioned about the PTA’s procedures for blocking web applications in the country. In a written response sent on August 26, the minister explained that the PTA is mandated to block \"unlawful content\" under Section 37 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016. While the PTA also submits complaints and requests for removal and blocking of applications directly to hosting entities such as Apple and Google, it has deployed the WMS for “internet content management.\" The minister admitted that the PTA has been using the WMS to block applications and websites within Pakistan. \"The PTA has till date blocked a total of 469 mobile applications (435 Android and 34 Apple) related to various categories including applications against the glory of Islam, indecent/immoral content, and fraudulent activities,\" the response stated. Social media site X (formerly known as Twitter) has been officially blocked in Pakistan since February 17, and the website of the opposition political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has remained inaccessible since before the elections. It is worth noting that on August 15, Minister of State for Information Technology Shaza Khawaja Fatima claimed that the WMS was necessary to “deal with cyber security attacks in the country.\" However, the minister in charge of the cabinet division’s response to the National Assembly makes no mention of cyber security concerns when blocking content. The controversial Web Monitoring System (known also as the Web Management System) was acquired by Pakistan in 2018 from the Canada-based company Sandvine for $18.5 million, according to a report by Coda. In December 2023, the WMS was further upgraded and tested on landing stations for internet submarine cables SMW 3, 4, and 5, a PTA spokesperson had told Geo TV earlier this year. The PTA claims that this “upgrade” led to national internet outages and slowdowns prior to the elections. The WMS employs Deep Packet Inspection technology to identify and block VPN traffic. It also enables government surveillance of all internet traffic coming to and from Pakistan, wrote journalist and digital rights activist Ramsha Jahangir in Dawn. However, the minister in charge of the cabinet division admitted to the National Assembly that despite its attempt to block content at the gateway level the content could still be accessed in Pakistan through VPNs, adding that VPN users who \"bypass the gateway through their private traffic are also bypassing the state policy regarding banned content.\" It should be noted that government officials, including ministers and the prime minister himself, have been using X (formerly Twitter) despite its official ban in Pakistan. It is unclear whether they are accessing the platform through VPNs. \"It is very difficult for PTA to effectively comply with PECA's obligations without controlling VPN misuse,\" the minister wrote in his written reply. The minister also revealed that the PTA had been working with the Ministry of Information Technology, the Pakistan Software Export Board, and P@SHA to \"whitelist\" IPs and VPNs in the country, having registered 20,437 VPNs to date. Additionally, the PTA has launched an e-portal for government organisations to lodge complaints and request content removal or blocking. To date, 47 stakeholders, including federal and provincial ministries and law enforcement agencies, are using the e-portal. Ramsha Jahangir told The News that the government and PTA’s disclosures to lawmakers clearly indicate that the Web Monitoring System is being used for whitelisting VPNs and blocking online content. \"They [PTA] have also acknowledged placing blocks at the gateway level. The cybersecurity or cable fault cover doesn’t hold anymore,\" she said. Jahangir added that, given the precedent of internet filtering in Pakistan through the WMS, it is now even more crucial for authorities to be transparent about their plans. \"Who purchased the WMS? Where did the funds come from?\" she asked."

  "content": "Earthquake tremors were felt in Islamabad and other parts of the country including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday. The KP cities rocked by the quake tremors include Peshawar, Swat, North Waziristan, Hangu, Mardan, Malakand, Buner, Shangla, Dir, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Kohistan, Abbottabad and Kurram. Meanwhile, Punjab cities Lahore, Multan, Chakwal and Sargodha also jolted.   The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that the earthquake originated at 10:57am Pakistan Standard Time (PST) and had a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale. The epicentre of the quake, the Met Office added, was in the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan at a depth of 215 kilometres. Today's tremors come nearly two months after a 4.7 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and KP in June. The quake was preceded by another one of 3.2 magnitude in Karachi in the same month. In May, a 2.3 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the metropolis including Gadap Town, Katohar and adjoining areas of Malir district. Before that, a 3.2 magnitude earthquake jolted Karachi's Malir district on April 24. It is pertinent to mention that earthquakes are not uncommon in Pakistan, as the country is situated on the boundary of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Large parts of South Asia are seismically active because a tectonic plate known as the Indian plate is pushing north into the Eurasian plate."

AFPKP CM doing alright at a time when PTI founder is in jail: Yousafzai.Former minister says party will \"definitely\" hold Sept 8 rally in ICT.Refutes rumours alleging differences within the former ruling...",
  "content": "With the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embroiled in 'internal turmoil' and challenges on legal and political fronts, senior leader and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) minister Shaukat Yousafzai has rebuked the rumours claiming the ex-ruling party was \"disturbed\" over its founder Imran Khan's detention. \"There is no substance in rumours suggesting that the PTI was disturbed due to Imran Khan's incarceration [...] the PTI's vote bank isn't going anywhere,\" Yousafzai said while speaking on Geo News' programme \"Geo Pakistan\" on Thursday. The PTI leader's remarks come as the Khan-founded party has been witnessing a rather public tug-of-war among its leadership on issues ranging from corruption and bad governance in KP under Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to the party leadership's inability to hold a public rally.   The party's founder and former prime minister, who was removed from power via a parliamentary vote in April 2022, has been behind bars for more than a year as well as several other key leaders such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi are either behind bars or in hiding owing to the nationwide crackdown launched against the party after the last year's May 9 riots. Earlier this month, Khan had summoned PTI's KP leaders Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar for a meeting at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail after the duo voiced support for former KP minister for communication and works Shakeel Ahmad who had stepped down over alleged corruption and bad governance by the CM Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province. Another issue the party faces is its inability to hold a major powershow as reflected in the Islamabad rally saga which has been dragging on for months with the local administration time again denying or revoking permission for a rally in the federal capital. Last week, the PTI put off its public gathering in Islamabad and rescheduled it for September 8 with Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan saying that the powershow was postponed following a party leadership's meeting with Imran Khan in Adiala jail. Gohar along with National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub claimed that the rally was rescheduled on Khan's instructions. The postponement of the Islamabad rally didn't sit well with Aleema Khan, the PTI founder's sister, who expressed a lack of confidence in the current leadership and said that they had no \"real intention\" of freeing the former prime minister from jail. Speaking on the alleged rift between party leadership, Yousafzai said that there were no differences within the party and that action was taken against PTI members in accordance with the party's discipline guidelines. \"Atif Khan has not been expelled from the party [....] KP CM Gandapur is doing alright in light of the fact that we have to run our campaign while the founder is in jail,\" the former provincial minister said. \"The KP chief minister has been given a task by assigning him the said post,\" he added. Reiterating that the party will \"definitely\" hold the September 8 rally in Islamabad, the PTI leader said that the biggest success of the party has been keeping its workers charged. It is to be noted that Islamabad Advocate General Ayyaz Shaukat has assured the party of granting permission to hold its rally in the federal capital on the said date, The News reported on Thursday. Touching upon the party's leaders who were in hiding, he said that he couldn't say anything about them. \"I don't know anything about Murad Saeed,\" he said while referring to the whereabouts of the former minister who has been in hiding since last year."

  "content": "Heavy rain is expected to lash Karachi and Hyderabad as strong monsoon system will reach the Arabian Sea Thursday evening, as per the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). The strong monsoon system near Tharparkar and India’s Rann of Kutch may penetrate into Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts, bringing torrential rains with thunderstorm in the evening, the Met Office said.  It said Karachi was likely to receive from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain in the next three days. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of intermittent rain in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, until August 31, with strong winds and thunderstorms, and heavy downpours in some places. Speaking during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', PMD Meteorologist Anjum Nazir Zaighum said a strong weather system was still present 270 km away from Karachi in the north-east.  “The weather system will increase its intensity marginally, when it will reach the Arabian Sea, and form a cyclone storm for about one and a half days,” he warned. In the Arabian Sea, Zaigham maintained, an average cyclone lasted for three to four days. The weather department, in its daily report, said wind was blowing at a speed of 13km from south-western side in the port city.  While, humidity level in the air was recorded 88% and the minimum temperature was 26°C. The mercury may maximum clock at 30°C. Meanwhile, schools in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal, Badin, Tandwalayar, Sanghar will remain closed on Friday, owing to the rain forecast. On the other hand, all schools in Karachi will remain open as the notification of holiday in schools of district Central has also been withdrawn. In the last 24 hours, the PMD said, Karachi’s Surjani Town received the highest amount of rain, 30mm.

Issuing an alert to relevant departments, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) anticipated more \"heavy to very heavy rain\" clubbed with wind/thunderstorms in parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan within the next 24 to 72 hours. Rainfall is likely to exceed 100mm in most parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, a statement read, adding that heavy downpours are expected to trigger urban flooding in urban centre, including Karachi and Hyderabad, as well as flash flooding in local nullahs and river tributaries. It also predicted heavy rainfall in Punjab and Balochistan that could cause urban flooding in urban centres, floods in hill torrents in both provinces and high river flows. The NDMA urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains.

  "content": "Critically acclaimed writer David Sedaris was in Pakistan to speak at the 2024 edition of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) last February. We caught up with him to discuss his impressions of the country, the often-tortured nature of an artist, and more. Excerpts: How is Pakistan different from what you expected or imagined? To tell you the truth, when I told people I was coming to Pakistan, they said you can’t go to Pakistan. They said it’s too dangerous. I’ve been so struck by how kind everyone has been. I can’t tell you how many people stopped me in the street — and they had no idea who I was — to just shake my hand and say: ‘Hello sir, where are you from?’ I don’t think I’ve ever met friendlier people in my life. When I get home, I’m going to tell everybody you have to go to Pakistan. It’s been a wonderful experience; I have really enjoyed it. That is great to hear, because most people have less-than-stellar things to say. Maybe they don’t travel enough. I went to the [Lahore] Museum and people stopped me and asked me to take a picture together. Also, the food has been great, a delight. Is there a chance your Pakistan experience will make it into your next book? Oh, yes. I’m already writing an essay about my time here. Any particular highlights from your trip? It’s nice to go to a place where you don’t speak the language, you can’t read it, and you just have to look around and guess what’s going on. What’s even better is when you’ve got someone who lives here who can explain things to you that they know. Like, I saw a sign that somebody with a tray of birds covered with a net had. I thought that people buy those birds and eat them, and then someone said, ‘No, you pay and then let the birds free.’ Then I saw a picture of mice that was [pasted on the side of a] truck and I thought, oh, you can pay to let the mice free and someone said, no, that’s the exterminator. I’ve had a number of experiences like that which I think would be fun to write about. If you lived in Tanzania, you wouldn’t want to hear what I have to say about Tanzania. But Pakistan? Thumbs up. What is humour and where does it come from? Are all funny people inherently sad and damaged? I’m sad and damaged. I can’t speak for everyone. But my sister [comedienne and actress] Amy [Sedaris] is very funny and she’s not sad and damaged. But I am. I just have a hole inside that can never be filled. I need applause and I need laughter to go into that hole, and there’s no amount that will ever fill it up; I need an endless supply or I would curl up and die. I don’t know why — I’m afraid to go to a psychiatrist — and I don’t know that I want to know. I’d be afraid that if I understood that, then I would stop writing or I would stop performing. I just keep on going. Actually, I’m not that sad, I’m just damaged. I think most people who are on stage, they’re trying to get by until they can get somewhere else. But I would rather be on stage looking for [affirmation] than to have gotten it in the first place. I divide the world into two groups: there are people who pay someone to listen to their problems and then there are people who get paid for telling people their problems. I’d rather be someone who gets paid for telling people my problems. What are you working on next and how soon can we pick it up? I’m working on another book. But I think I’ve only written two things that are good enough for it. Since my last book came out, I’ve probably written 12 things [and] I think three of them are good enough. The other nine are fine, but they are not good enough for a book.  How do you figure out what’s good enough and what’s not? I just feel it. I wrote an essay a few months ago and I feel strongly that it’s the best thing I’ve ever written. I didn’t need an audience to tell me that, I felt it. It’s not like I have a formula and I can sit down and do it again, it just sort of happened. I would like more essays like that before I [publish a new book]. Because if I were to put out a book and I had three essays that are good and 13 that were just okay, I can’t expect people not to notice that. And if people notice it, they’re going to say, ‘Obviously, he doesn’t really care anymore.’ And that’s the worst that can happen: not to care anymore. Then you should just stop. You don’t want to lose your passion or your drive. Right. But I think it happens to people all the time, especially when they become comfortable. So you have to become uncomfortable again? That’s the good thing about travelling. All of a sudden, you’re not in your comfort zone and you’re not getting special treatment because people recognize you. I don’t like to do things in order to write about them. Let’s say if I would get a job in McDonald’s so I can write about it, it’s just fake. I just don’t want to have inauthentic experiences and then write about them. It’s different, too, because I’m here [in Lahore] because I was invited so that’s always different than buying a ticket. It just changes the circumstances of the visit. It doesn’t mean that I can’t write about it, I just have to write about it differently. What inspired you to start travelling? When did you start travelling in earnest? I have a list called ‘countries I have been to.’ And then I was trying to get to two new countries per year, but then I got slowed down during the pandemic. So, Pakistan is my 58th country, but I really want to get to 100. I feel I really have to step on it. I’m 67, I got to get going here. And I just travel with different people. Some people are great to travel with, some people are just… they’ll just slow you down or are just not interested in the same things."

  "description": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  founder Imran Khan.   Reuters/File  Sources say university has received several emails with concerns. Oxford to shortlist of candidates fit for position in early October.Khan says he wants to \"give back\" to university for its help. <p...",
  "content": " LONDON: As incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder seeks nomination for ceremonial post of Oxford University's chancellor, the prestigious British varsity has received a number of emails and a petition raising concerns about the former premier's candidacy. University sources have confirmed that its office has received several emails raising concerns about his support for the Taliban in the past and corruption cases. The university has told Geo News that the shortlist of candidates fit for the position of Oxford's chancellor will be announced in early October. Khan has said from jail that he has submitted his nomination to run for Oxford’s new chancellor because the university helped him in his early years and he wanted to \"give back\" and that \"I am committed to giving back to the world the resilience, determination and integrity that life has taught me, even when the odds are stacked against me\". The petition to the university says that \"while Mr Khan is a prominent figure, there are significant aspects of his public and personal record that are deeply troubling and deserve careful consideration\". It tells the Oxford University: \"Mr Imran Khan has frequently expressed views and taken actions that align with extremist elements, particularly the Taliban. Mr Khan has proposed allowing the Taliban to open an office in Pakistan, which sparked widespread criticism both within the country and internationally. This suggestion was particularly alarming given the Taliban’s history of violence and human rights abuses. He has referred to the Taliban as freedom fighters', especially during the US presence in Afghanistan. After the US withdrawal, Mr Khan celebrated the event as the Afghans 'breaking the shackles of slavery', a statement widely interpreted as support for the Taliban's return to power.\" The petition says that Imran Khan also supported Osama Bin Laden.  \"In a speech to Pakistan’s National Assembly, Mr Khan controversially referred to Osama bin Laden as a 'shaheed' (martyr), a term that honours his death rather than condemning his actions as a global terrorist. Mr Khan has made numerous statements that have drawn criticism for promoting misogynistic views. He has repeatedly blamed women's clothing for incidents of rape, claiming that 'if a woman wears very few clothes, it will have an impact on men unless they’re robots'. Such remarks shift the blame away from the perpetrators and perpetuate harmful stereotypes about women.\"  The petition says that Khan supporters harassed and attacked critics and trolled them online. \"This use of social media to silence critics and discredit accusers reflects a disturbing pattern of behaviour that raises serious questions about Mr Khan's respect for women’s rights and personal integrity.\" The petition questions Khan's personal integrity and reminds the university that \"Mr Khan was recently convicted in the Toshakhana case, which involved the illegal sale of state gifts. This conviction raises serious concerns about his commitment to transparency and ethical governance.\" The petition asks the university to \"carefully consider the broader implications of electing Khan as chancellor.  \"Oxford University has a long history of upholding the highest standards of leadership, ethical behaviour, and respect for human rights — values that seem at odds with Mr Khan’s public and personal record,\" it says. The cricketer-turned-politician has confirmed he has applied to be in the running as the next chancellor of the University of Oxford for a 10-year term.  Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Keble College. He has previously served as chancellor of the University of Bradford from 2005 until 2014, is vying to replace conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who announced in February his resignation as Oxford’s chancellor. The final list will be announced after a month but reports have said that Lord William Hague, the former foreign secretary, Lord Peter Mandelson, the Labour grandee, and Lady Angiolini, the prominent lawyer who led the inquiry into the rape, abduction and murder of Sarah Everard will also be running for the post. More than 250,000 Oxford alumni will vote in an online ballot later this year. The successful candidate will serve a 10-year term, supporting Prof Irene Tracey, the current vice-chancellor."

  "description": "With a deep depression situated approximately 170 kilometres from Karachi on Friday, Pakistan’s coastal areas are bracing for rains as the storm system has intensified into Cyclone Asna over the northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh’s coast. Zoom Earth’s live radar also denoted the system as a cyclonic storm with a speed of 65 kilometres per hour. According to an alert from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued at 5:30pm today, a deep depression (a very strong low-pressure area) over India’s Rann of Kutch has moved westward during the last six hours and now lies around 170 kilometres east/southeast of Karachi. It said the system was likely to “keep moving initially west/northwestwards” and under its influence, widespread rain/wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy/very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls were likely in Karachi division, Tharparker, Badin, Thatta, Sajawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts till Saturday.    This satellite image captured at 9:30am on Aug 30 shows a deep depression over Arabian Sea, about 200km away from Karachi. — PMD  Met officials have described the formation of a cyclone in the monsoon season as a “rare phenomenon”. “It would be a rare event as cyclones are uncommon in the monsoon season,” Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz said earlier. “There is an 80 per cent chance for a cyclonic storm’s formation when the deep depression would move from land to the sea and get favourable conditions.” Sarfraz earlier said if the storm materialised it would be the first cyclone in the Arabian Sea in August since 1976 and would get the name ‘Asna’ suggested by Pakistan. He added that regional cyclones were assigned names according to a list prepared by a 13-country panel, including Pakistan.      India’s weather office said that the deep depression would move northwest over the Arabian Sea in the next two days. The formation of a cyclonic storm over the Arabian Sea in August was a rare occurrence, the Indian Express newspaper reported, saying the last such storm was in 1964. “Cyclone formation generally takes place over sea and then it moves over to land. This type of system is unusual because it formed over land and is now moving towards the sea,” Ashok Kumar Das, head of the Indian Meteorological Department in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, told Reuters. Heavy rains expected over next 3 days Under the weather system’s influence, the PMD has predicted widespread heavy rains in several districts of Sindh as well as those along the Balochistan coast.    View of sea waves seen from a residential apartment at Clifton Beach in Karachi on Aug 29, 2024. — Reuters  “Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy/very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls” are likely till August 31 in the Karachi division as well as Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts. About the Balochistan coastline, the PMD predicted “widespread rain/wind-thunderstorm with scattered heavy/very heavy falls” in Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Kech, and Gwadar districts from August 30 to September 1, with occasional gaps. “Heavy rains may create water logging/rain inundation in low-lying areas of Sindh-Makran coast,” the Met Office warned. It further said sea conditions were likely to remain rough/very rough with squally winds of 50-60km/hour gusting at 70km/hour. The PMD advised fishermen in Sindh not to venture into the sea till August 31 and those in Balochistan till September 1.            View this post on Instagram              Schools shut; death toll in India reaches 31 Meanwhile, schools in Karachi and Hyderabad as well as in parts of Kutch district in India’s Gujarat were shut, officials said, as heavy rain lashed both places. Three more people died in Gujarat overnight from rain-related incidents, taking the toll to 31 this week, and authorities evacuated more than 8,700 people from ten districts in the state over the last 24 hours, officials said.    Children play, with the rainbow and rain clouds in the background, at Clifton Beach in Karachi on Aug 30, 2024. — Reuters  While the Karachi authorities had earlier decided to keep schools open on Thursday despite predictions from the Met Office, today’s closure was finally announced late last night. In Hyderabad, Deputy Commissioner Zainul Abedin Memon announced the closure of all public and private schools across the district for today, according to a notification dated August 29. Memon, also the chief of the district’s disaster management authority, said the decision was made in view of the “ensuing heavy monsoon rains” and the relevant alerts issued by the PMD. Parts of Karachi received 147 millimetres of rain overnight, the local weather office said, and the city’s mayor, Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X, urged residents to avoid “unnecessary movement”. Pakistani authorities warned of urban flooding and flash floods in rural areas due to the heavy rain, and urged citizens to stay indoors. Both countries warned fishermen against venturing out into the sea. A ban on “fishermen venturing into the sea, as well as on swimming, bathing, diving, and wading in the sea/beaches and coastal areas” of Karachi Division had been imposed from Aug 29 till Aug 31 (Saturday).

  "description": "Five terrorists have been killed while three others were injured in intelligence-based operations (IBOs) carried out by security forces in multiple Balochistan districts, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. In the latest flare-up of violence, dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks on Sunday midnight across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians. At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives as militants went on a rampage across the province, storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In response, security forces neutralised 21 militants. Among those killed were 23 people in Musakhail, mostly labourers from Punjab, who were offloaded from trucks and vans and shot dead after an identity check. Referring to the deadly attacks earlier this week, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement today: “The security forces are conducting extensive intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to hunt down the perpetrators of these heinous acts. “On night [of] 29/30 August, in three separate IBOs in District Kech, Panjgur, and Zhob, five terrorists were sent to hell by the security forces, while three terrorists got injured during the intense fire exchange,” the ISPR said. It added that the sanitisation operations would “continue until all perpetrators, facilitators, and abetters of these atrocious acts are brought to justice”. “Security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability, and progress of Balochistan,” the military asserted. Following the spate of attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday asserted that there was “no room for any weakness”. Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari ordered effective measures to ensure the “complete elimination” of terrorism. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi vowed his full support for the Balochistan government in combating terrorism when he visited the province on Tuesday. PM Shehbaz also undertook a one-day trip to the region to assess the security situation there. 12 TTP terrorists eliminated in KP’s Khyber district Later in the day, the ISPR said that security forces were conducting extensive IBOs in the Tirah valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Khyber district based on the reported presence of militants from the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outfit since August 20. It said security forces “effectively engaged” TTP locations on Wednesday and Thursday, sending 12 terrorists “to hell”. The ISPR said the operations had resulted in a “major setback” for the TTP and its affiliates with 37 terrorists so far “sent to hell” while 14 militants suffered serious injuries. “The IBOs will continue till peace in the area is restored” and the TTP eliminated, the ISPR said, adding that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country”. President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for the successful IBOs.         Rise in terror attacks On August 19, three terrorists responsible for the killing of Panjgur’s deputy commissioner were eliminated in an operation by security forces in Mastung. Separately, three soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed the same day after security forces foiled an infiltration attempt at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district. In “extensive” IBOs conducted since August 20 in KP’s Khyber, security forces had neutralised 25 terrorists and injured 11 others. The country has lately witnessed a sharp uptick in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and KP. Attacks escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces. According to an annual security report issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies, Pakistan witnessed 1,524 violence-related fatalities and 1,463 injuries from 789 terror attacks and counter-terror operations in 2023 — marking a record six-year high. Islamabad has blamed Kabul for allowing the TTP — a separate group but aligned with the Afghan Taliban — to use Afghan soil for launching attacks inside Pakistan. However, the Taliban administration has denied the charges. "

  "description": "Pakistan and Bangladesh on Friday agreed that there was a need to work closely for the progress and prosperity of the people of both countries, the prime minister’s office said in a press release. Pakistan’s government had earlier, through a statement on Aug 7, expressed solidarity with the people of Bangladesh after the fall of Hasina Wajid’s government amid widespread protests.      Hasina’s 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents. She was replaced by Nobel laureate Yunus, who is heading an interim government facing the monumental task of charting democratic reforms ahead of expected new elections. Last week, Prime Minister (PM) Shehbaz Sharif reached out to the interim government of Bangladesh, extending an offer of aid to address the catastrophic impacts of recent flooding. In a telephone conversation between the Chief Adviser of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus and PM Shehbaz today, the two leaders agreed that greater regional cooperation could play a vital role in uplifting the lives of South Asian people. “While congratulating him on his new role, lauded his contribution towards socio-economic development of his country and expressed my heartfelt sympathies over the devastating recent floods in Bangladesh,” the PM wrote on the X platform.         He expressed sympathies over the devastation caused by the recent floods in Bangladesh, the statement from his office added. The prime minister underscored the importance of revitalising bilateral relations through enhanced cooperation in different domains. Noting the historical, religious, and cultural bonds between Pakistan and Bangladesh, the prime minister also expressed a keen desire to boost commercial relations, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people contacts. Relations between Paki­stan and Bangladesh largely remained strained during Hasina Wajid’s tenure, marked by historical grievances stemming from the 1971 war. Additionally, the punishments meted out to figures associated with that period by her government have been a continuous source of tension. The change in Dhaka is being seen as an opportunity for Pakistan to reengage with the important South Asian country. "

  "description": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday said that the recent spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan was “planned to ruin” a Pakistan-hosted summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) scheduled for October. Islamabad is set to host the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting from October 15-16 under its rotating chairmanship. Islamabad has also sent an invite to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite long-standing tensions over occupied Kashmir and allegations of terrorism. In the latest flare-up of violence, dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks on Sunday midnight across Balochistan, killing at least 50, including 14 security men. Addressing the Senate today, Naqvi said: “We have identified clear links showing that they [terrorists] planned to ruin the SCO conference. “A lot of people are in anguish [about SCO meeting] so that it should not be organised,” he said, adding that the attacks were a conspiracy against the summit.            View this post on Instagram              The interior minister noted that the Balochistan attacks were devised by not just one body but “terrorist organisations had carried them out together”. “The incident on the night of August 26 was not a normal one. There was complete planning behind it,” the independent senator emphasised. “There is no [military] operation being carried out,” the interior minister clarified, responding to another senator’s statements. Naqvi recalled that during his Thursday visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had “very detailed” discussions with the local political stakeholders, in which various decisions were taken after considering their feedback. “Those who acknowledge Pakistan, we will highly welcome them. They are very respectable for us, though there can be differences [with us], which we are trying our best to address and will do so. “Those who do not accept the state and take up arms are terrorists and we will deal with them,” Naqvi vowed. He stressed the need for “clarity and unity” against those who opposed the state. ‘Rs13bn allocated for governance, counterterrorism’ Naqvi also informed the Senate that Rs8 billion have been allocated for Balochistan — Rs1bn for each of the eight divisions — while another Rs5bn for the province’s Counterterrorism Department (CTD). Those Rs8bn would be used to “solve minor issues with the support of the local MNAs and MPAs”, the senator explained.      “The biggest issue [in Balochistan] is the shortage of government officers, who are the federal government representatives,” the minister said. Referring to the deputation of the 48th Common Group in Balochistan, the minister said 30-40 officers would head to the province within 10-15 days. Naqvi further said that “more than a dozen decisions” were taken regarding the province during his visits there. At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives as militants went on a rampage across the province earlier this week — storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In response, security forces neutralised 21 militants. Among those killed were 23 people in Musakhail, mostly labourers from Punjab, who were offloaded from trucks and vans and shot dead after an identity check. Naqvi vowed his full support for the Balochistan government in combating terrorism when he visited the province on Tuesday. Following the spate of attacks, PM Shehbaz asserted that there was “no room for any weakness”, also making a one-day visit to the province to assess the security situation there.

  "description": "   Photo via author.  Twelve members of a family were killed in their sleep early Friday morning when the roof of their mud house collapsed due to heavy rainfall in Maidan tehsil, Upper Dir, a rescue official said. Women and children were among the dead, rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi confirmed to Dawn.com. He added that the bodies had been pulled out and shifted to Maidan hospital after the search operation was completed under the supervision of the district emergency officer. District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed also confirmed the incident. He identified the deceased as Noshad Khan, Khan Bacha, Wali Rehman, their respective wives, and their children aged three to 22. Heavy rain has lashed parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa all month, including the Malakand and Hazara division, where river flow has also increased. Floods have swept away the main bridge connecting Mansehra and Naran. Recently, a steel bridge was installed for connectivity with Babusar. The Karakoram Highway was blocked after a landslide at Diamer. However, it was reopened for traffic on Friday. Pakistan experiences its monsoon season from July to August, typically receiving around 255mm of rain each month. In 2022, the monsoon rains caused extensive damage throughout the country, with over 75,000 homes destroyed and 130,000 partially damaged in KP alone, according to figures from the government and international aid agencies. A Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) report issued on August 28 shows that 74 people have been killed and 128 injured from July to August 28 due to the current monsoon spell in KP. The report also said that 906 houses were damaged due to rain-related incidents in the last two months. From July 29 to August 1, 24 people were killed and 17 injured as heavy rains lashed the province, according to the KP PDMA. On August 17, a local government representative was swept away by strong currents in a Swabi nullah, and a minor boy was killed in a Bannu wall collapse incident as heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: “Religious outfits” manipulate Islamic laws to suit their likes and dislikes, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) chairman said on Thursday. “No law carries the death penalty for desecration of Holy Quran, but religious elements resort to mob justice to kill suspects,” Dr Raghib Hussain Naimi said. “This is not only un-Islamic but also contrary to the law of the land.” Talking to media here at the CII office, Dr Naimi said blasphemy laws had four different punishments. The punishment for desecration of the Holy Quran is life imprisonment while the punishment for insulting members of the Holy Prophet’s (Peace be upon him) household and his companions (Sahaba) is seven years imprisonment, the CII chief added. The punishment for violation of the Prohibition of Qadianiyat Ordinance is three years.  The law envisages death penalty only for a person found guilty of blaspheming the Holy Prophet (PBUH)  The law envisages death penalty only for a person proven guilty of committing blasphemy against the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), Dr Naimi said. “But religious groups believe that the punishment for all the four crimes is the same — death — and take the law into their own hands. “No one has the authority to issue a Fatwa for killing an individual suspected of committing blasphemy,” Raghib Naimi said. He criticised religious elements for “playing with the popular sentiment for political gains”.      When his attention was drawn to a perception that the CII had failed to identify and isolate clerics who issue inflammatory statements or incite the public over blasphemy, the CII chairman recounted his own recent experience. “I declared that the Fatwa for death of the Chief Justice of Pakistan was Haram. Soon after that I received up to 500 threatening messages, some of which were laced with abusive language,” Dr Naimi said. He said the “saner elements among religious circles” were afraid of extremists. The CII has repeatedly stated that giving Fatwa to kill or taking the law into one’s own hands is illegal,  unconstitutional and against the principles of Sharia. “Sharia does not authorise any individual to take another person’s life,” the CII chairman said. He expressed displeasure over growing intolerance in society, regretting that many people get “emotionally charged after receiving media messages”, but they are not ready to listen to religious matters in their true spirit. “It is clear in all respects that only the state has the authority and the right to punish those found guilty of committing any blasphemy.” Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday granted seven-day protective pre-arrest bail to the husband of the main suspect in the Karsaz traffic accident case. The SHC directed the applicant to furnish a solvent surety of Rs50,000 and surrender himself before the trial court till or before Sept 4. Danish Iqbal, husband of suspect Natasha Danish, through his counsel moved the SHC and asserted that after registration of a case, the female suspect was arrested, but during the course of investigation the applicant had also been named as suspect. The lawyer contended that police had been raiding the house of the applicant and other places in order to arrest him while prosecution had nothing to connect him with the alleged offence. He also argued that the applicant was the chief executive officer of Gul Ahmed Energy Limited and the Toyota Land Cruiser, which had been used in the accident, was registered in the name of the company. The lawyer further contended that after receiving letters from the investigating officer of the case to provide documents about ownership of the vehicle in question, the same had already been provided to the IO, but again a notice was issued by the IO under Section 160 of the Pakistan Penal Code for similar purpose and with ulterior motive. The counsel sought two-week protective bail to enable the applicant to approach the IO and join the investigation. After a preliminary hearing, a single-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Muhammad Saleem Jesser in his order said: “Prima facie, without dilating upon the merits and demertis of the case, applicant Danish Iqbal son of Iqbal Ali Mohammad is hereby granted protective pre-arrest bail in crime No.229/2024, under Sections 320, 337-G, 279, 247 PPC read with Section 322 PPC, registered with PS Bahadurabad, Karachi, for seven days subject to furnishing his solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000 and PR bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of Nazir of this court”. This order shall cease to have its effect on Sept 4 or whenever the applicant approaches/surrenders before the court having jurisdiction whichever is earlier, it added. According to the prosecution, Natasha Danish has been accused of recklessly driving the Toyota Land Cruiser and killing 60-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter Amna and wounding three others in an accident near Karsaz on August 19. Initially, the police had registered a case against the female suspect under various provisions of the PPC, which were all bailable offences and later during the course of investigation Section 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab) of the PPC was also incorporated in the FIR, which is a non-bailable section. The female suspect was arrested on Aug 19 and a couple of days later a local court had sent her to prison on judicial remand and sought investigation report from the IO as required under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code. It may be recalled that the provincial police officer Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday said that the medical report of the female suspect showed that she was under the influence of the narcotic methamphetamine (commonly known as crystal meth).

  "description": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Thursday released videos of two of three men, including a senior army officer, kidnapped from D.I. Khan the previous day. The officer and his two brothers were kidnapped from a mosque in their native area, Mohalla Khadr Khel of Kalachi tehsil, when they were receiving people who had come to condole with them over their father’s demise. The suspected militants forcefully took away the three brothers, one of whom worked for the Rawal­­pindi Cantonment Board and the other for Nadra. In separate videos, two of the abducted men said they were “far away” from the “government-controlled areas”. The two brothers were seen sitting in front of a black cloth, surrounded by gunmen whose faces were cropped. “We are safe and far away from the government [controlled] areas and in the custody of the Taliban. We request the government and higher authorities to accept the Taliban’s demands as soon as possible to ensure our release,” said the two men. They urged their relatives not to post anything about their kidnapping on social media. There has been no official statement by the ISPR. Reports suggest there were more people kidnapped along with the three brothers, but Dawn could not independently verify this information. Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2024 "

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has claimed his government was “actively engaged” with the Afghan Taliban on cross-border terrorism and that Kabul was “ready to cooperate”. While talking to reporters after the hearing of the 190m pounds corruption reference on Tuesday, Mr Khan rejected the criticism of his party’s government over resettling alleged terrorists. He said after the fall of Kabul in August 2021, Pakistan asked the interim Afghan government to eliminate the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and they were ready to cooperate. Pakistan has blamed the outlawed TTP operating out of Afghanistan for the terrorist attacks carried out in the country during the past few years.  Claims Shehbaz will ‘go missing’ after exiting PM Office  The Foreign Office and the Army have repeatedly urged the Afghan government to take action against the presence of terror inside Afghanistan. However, officials in Pakistan believe that the Afghan Taliban government is unwilling to act against these terror outfits. During his interaction with the reporters, Mr Khan also admitted that his government was holding talks with the Kabul regime, and the former ISI chief, retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed, briefed the opposition on this issue. However, the ex-ISI chief was removed “on the demand of Nawaz Sharif” which “adversely affected the dialogues”. According to Mr Khan, the interior minister said terrorists were operating out of Afghanistan, which means that the allegations against PTI were baseless. He questioned the recent wave of terrorism in Balochistan and asked whether the PTI was responsible for unrest in the province and the law and order situation in the Kacha area. According to Mr Khan, the Army was being blamed for the unrest in Balochistan, dacoits’ attacks of dacoits in the Kacha area and even street crimes. He claimed that during his party’s government, intelligence agencies were countering terrorism, but now they are working to “finish a political party”. Enforced disappearances Mr Khan also said the government is “doing nothing” to stop the enforced disappearances of the citizens despite Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) directions. The ex-PM warned that his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, would become a missing person if the establishment “devises a Plan B”. He recalled that the IHC has advised PM Shehbaz to stop enforced disappearances, however, no step has been taken to resolve this grave issue. Mr Khan also denied media reports that he instructed PTI party leaders to come out of hiding, saying they would be “picked up” upon resurfacing. He advised the party leaders to continue staying in their respective hiding places. Proceedings Earlier, during the hearing, defence counsels continued the cross-examination of the National Accountability Bureau investigation officer. The proceedings were adjourned till Friday (today). Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2024 "

  "description": "RAWALPINDI: The superintendent of Central Jail Adiala has issued a notice to former deputy superintendent Mohammad Akram to vacate his official residence in jail colony within two days otherwise its electricity and water supplies will be cut off. A letter to Mr Akram said he would be held responsible for any liquidity damage, no excuse would be accepted and action would be taken in accordance with the law. Referring to a notification issued by S&GAD regarding the allotment of government residences, the letter from the jail superintendent said government employees after transfer or retirement can only keep their residences for two months. Therefore, it said: “Since you have been transferred to Inspectorate General Prison Lahore on June 20 2024 by the Punjab Home Department, more than two months have passed. Still you have occupied the government’s official residence which is against the law.” It may be noted that Mr Akram, after his transfer, was residing in the official house and was taken into custody on Aug 14 by law enforcement agencies for allegedly facilitating PTI founder Imran Khan in jail. Mr Akram’s wife Maimoona Riaz later filed a petition in the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench seeking recovery of her husband. On Thursday, the city police officer (CPO) appeared before the court and stated that the police had been working to trace Mr Akram. The court directed the CPO to ensure the safety of his family. The court said the missing persons’ issue had become alarming. After the police requested the court to grant them 14 days to recover the missing man, the court adjourned the case till September 10. Meanwhile, the Home Department made a major reshuffle in the prison department and posted an additional superintendent and two deputy superintendents to the Adiala jail on Thursday. According to a notification, Ali Ameer Shah (BS-17), deputy superintendent from the inspectorate of prison Lahore, has been posted as additional superintendent and Sabtain Raza (BS-17), deputy superintendent (executive) Central Jail Lahore, as the deputy superintendent at Adiala jail against the vacant post. Zaibunnisa (BS-16), deputy superintendent Central Jail Bahawalpur, has also been posted as deputy superintendent in the Rawalpindi jail. Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2024 "

  "description": "• Sindh launches project to bring solar power to 1.6m households • PPP chief says green energy only solution to crisis • Compares PML-N’s power relief with PTI’s petrol subsidy, warns ‘short-term relief may lead to long-term suffering’ KARACHI: The decision of the Punjab government to provide a subsidy to power consumers in the province remains a bone of contention between the two major allies, with PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calling the move ‘unsustainable’ in a speech on Thursday. The PPP chief, whose party rules Sindh, also compared the relief with a petrol subsidy announced by the PTI government during its last days in power. Such moves could provide “short-term relief but [may] lead to long-term suffering”, he said while speaking at the Chief Minister’s House to mark the launching ceremony of the solar home systems project. The project aims to provide solar panels to 1.6 million low-income households across the province in phases. In the first phase, 200,000 households will be solarised. “We welcome the [Punjab government] announcement to the extent that it aims to lower electricity costs, but the decision remains perplexing to me. If short-term relief leads to long-term suffering, such projects are not in the public interest,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “Frankly speaking, I am unable to understand this decision [of the Punjab government],” he said, adding that “it could cause a year-long pain” to the people of the province. “It reminds [me of] the same decision which Khan Sahib [Imran Khan] had taken when his government was about to fall [due to the opposition’s protests]… At that time, he reduced the price of petrol by Rs20 per litre. That relief, however, had lasted a week or two but we are still facing the challenges due to that decision,” he added. “Today, there’s neither a long march nor a threat of a vote of no confidence. So I am unable to guess that why such a decision has been made.” He reiterated his desire for a sustainable solution to the electricity crisis and asserted that relief to the masses in electricity bills could be achieved through green energy. He also highlighted the plight of the people of Larkana, who endure 18 hours of loadshedding daily. However, he asked Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to discuss the electricity relief matter with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Sindh consumers and find ways to facilitate the inflation-hit people. “If the federal government can convince us of its cheaper electricity plan, we are ready to forego our solar home system project and follow theirs. But if they cannot, they should support us,” he said, linking the relief with renewable energy. The event was attended by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, former CM Qaim Ali Shah, PPP Sindh President Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Sindh Energy Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, provincial ministers, and other party leaders. Solar power project Earlier, the PPP chairperson inaugurated the first phase of the solar energy project, which aims to provide relief to the people affected by expensive electricity and loadshedding. The project, launched by the Sindh government, will see 200,000 families, eligible under the Benazir Income Support Programme, receive free solar systems in two regions — Larkana district and Karachi division — of the province. In his address, Mr Bhutto-Zardari emphasised his party’s commitment to sustainable solutions for public issues. He stated that this project aligned with the PPP’s manifesto vision, adding that the PPP wanted to ease the burden on the lower-income segments of society. He also highlighted that when he initially proposed the idea of providing solar energy to low-income families, it was criticised by various quarters, including the media and caretaker government. However, he noted with satisfaction that the entire nation had now recognised the need to provide the poor with affordable electricity. Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2024 "

  "description": "LAHORE: As Punjab cabinet on Thursday approved a Rs14 per unit subsidy on August and September electricity bills for consumers in the province and Islamabad, using from 201 to 500 units, Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman was conspicuous by his absence, sparking speculations that he was made to skip the meeting for his ‘controversial remarks’ on the issue. The finance minister earlier had claimed that the actual cost of the subsidy was Rs90 billion and not Rs45bn, as claimed by the Maryam administration, and that half of the amount to be spent on providing this relief to Punjab would be funded by the federal government. Following the minister’s statement, the Punjab government categorically clarified that it would exclusively fund this relief with Rs45bn. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had reportedly expressed her displeasure over Rehman’s statement and barred him from issuing any further statements on the matter. Mr Rehman could not be reached out for his comment on the matter as his cell phone was switched off, while Information Minister Azma Bokhari couldn’t respond to Dawn’s query as she was in the UK. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) senior leader Qamar Zaman Kaira has also sought clarity on who will foot the bill for this subsidy. “Since electricity is a federal subject, it appeared that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, who had announced this relief, along with CM Maryam, was referring to all the people of Pakistan consuming up to 500 units of electricity. Had it been only for Punjab, the announcement would have been made by the CM, instead of Nawaz Sharif,” Mr Kaira told Dawn. Besides the opposition PTI, PML-N’s two partners in the federal government – the PPP and the MQM-P – have also questioned the rationale behind the move, with the latter’s leader Mustafa Kamal demanding Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to announce a matching relief for the entire country. Speaking at the cabinet meeting on Thursday, CM Maryam Nawaz said the people of Punjab and Islamabad consuming electricity from 201 to 500 units were being given a relief of Rs14 per unit of electricity in August and September bills and Punjab has allocated Rs46bn for the purpose. “This is a huge relief in electricity bills, which has never been given before. With [inclusion of] this relief, two million electricity bills have reached the consumers so far for payment. On every bill, it is written that this was the original bill and after the relief from Punjab government, it has been reduced to that [amount]. More than 150,000 consumers of Islamabad are also being given relief in their electricity bills,” she said. The CM said that the relief in electricity bills was an urgent measure, while a solar panel project was also being launched for [provision of] sustainable relief. “Press conferences were held, competition was held, but I must thank them [the critics of the relief] for promoting our project in the public,” she said, indirectly referring to the PPP and the PTI governments in Sindh and KP, respectively. The cabinet also approved Punjab’s first comprehensive Climate Resilient Punjab Vision and Action Plan 2024. In the first comprehensive policy in the country’s history, an action plan has been prepared on flood management, ecosystem infrastructure, food security, agriculture and heatwave, the meeting was told. “Green cover, biodiversity, waste management, green transport, water conservation and departmental action plans have been included,” the CM added. The CM said the impact of transparency and end to corruption should be visible in the performance of all institutions. “There is corruption in every institution, the elimination of which is our responsibility,” she added. The cabinet also approved formation of the Punjab Zakat and Ushar Council. It dissolved the existing Punjab Bait-ul-Mal Council under the Punjab Bait-ul-Mal Act 1991 and approved the establishment of the new council. Moreover, the cabinet gave approval to lease the government land to Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital in Lahore, besides approving Punjab Public Service Commission Annual Report for 2023. It also approved the Annual Audit Report 2023-24 of Public Sector Enterprises of Punjab Government, besides giving nod to the Special Audit Report of Accounts of Punjab Government and District Governments for the years 2016-17, 2021-22 and 2022-23.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday dismissed the Afghan Taliban’s latest offer to mediate between Pakistan and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, labelling it an insult to the victims of TTP’s terrorist activities. “Pakistan has no plans to engage in any talks with TTP. We believe that such offers are an affront to thousands of victims of TTP, who have been killed in Pakistan,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said during a weekly media briefing. She was responding to a query regarding the offer made by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, who had suggested in a recent media interview that the Taliban administration could facilitate negotiations with the TTP. Mujahid also trivialised the TTP issue, referring to it as an “internal matter” of Pakistan. The TTP, which maintains sanctuaries in Afghanistan from where it orchestrates and executes terrorist activities in Pakistan, has significantly strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban government. Reiterating Islamabad’s position on the TTP, Ms Baloch advised the Afghan authorities to take action against the TTP and other terror groups that continue to threaten Pakistan’s security and have been involved in the killing of Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil. She also noted that Pakistan has not only bilaterally shared “concrete evidence” of the involvement of Afghanistan-based individuals and groups in terrorist incidents within Pakistan, but the presence of terror groups, including the TTP, in Afghanistan has also been documented in multiple independent reports.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: With the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) heads of government meeting drawing closer, New Delhi is faced with a diplomatic dilemma: whether or not Prime Minister Narendra Modi should attend the summit in Islamabad. While diplomatic sources suggest the chances of Mr Modi crossing the border are slim, India is keeping its cards close to its chest, fuelling a guessing game that has left analysts and observers on both sides of the divide wondering — will he or won’t he?“ Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch confirmed at the weekly media briefing on Thursday that Prime Minister Modi has been invited for the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting, which Pakistan is hosting on Oct 15-16, under its rotating chairmanship. Speculation about PM Modi’s participation in the SCO meeting gained momentum in the Indian media last weekend, following reports that Delhi had received an invitation. Mr Modi’s past record of skipping meetings of heads of government council — the second highest forum within SCO and instead sending a ministerial representative — fuelled media claims he would also miss this event.  Pakistan to host SCO meeting on Oct 15-16  Tensions between Islamabad and Delhi because of longstanding dispute over Kashmir, allegations of terrorism, and a history of military conflicts further reinforce the notion that Mr Modi’s in-person attendance is unlikely. Furthermore, his possible non-attendance would align with India’s broader strategic caution in dealing with Pakistan, especially on platforms where Islamabad plays a significant host role. India’s participation in the SCO, even otherwise, is a delicate balancing act, weighing its need for regional security cooperation against its wariness of China’s growing influence within the organisation. By engaging selectively in SCO’s economic strategies, India is pursuing a nuanced approach that aims to counterbalance Chinese dominance while fostering constructive ties with Central Asian nations. A surprising turn, however, came earlier this week when the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), following reports in Indian media, issued an advisory to its domestic media outlets, cautioning them against speculating on PM Modi’s participation in the SCO meeting. The advisory stated, “We are noticing that several outlets are running news that PM won’t attend a SCO meeting in Pakistan or EAM will attend a SCO meeting in Pakistan. Please note, MEA hasn’t commented on this matter and would request speculative news in this regard be avoided.” Ironically, this advisory instead of quelling the rumors, breathed new life into them. Diplomatic sources in both capitals still insist that not only Mr Modi’s visit to Pakistan is highly unlikely, but Delhi is also unlikely to send a high-profile figure like External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar as his representative. Instead, India’s participation in the SCO meeting will be a closely guarded secret, leaving many to wonder who will ultimately represent the country. India’s hesitation to attend meetings in Pakistan is a well-established stance, dating back to its boycott of the 19th Saarc Summit in November 2016, which was to be hosted by Pakistan. The boycott led to a stalemate, leaving the regional body in limbo, as the Saarc charter mandates that all member states must be present for a summit to take place. In contrast, the SCO has no such restriction, allowing for more flexibility in its meeting arrangements. Islamabad has, meanwhile, regularly shown openness to participating in meetings hosted by India. Notably, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari travelled to India in 2023 to attend an SCO meeting. Similarly, former adviser on foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz, visited Amritsar in Dec­­ember 2016 for the Heart of Asia conference. Add­itionally, when India hosted the SCO Council of Heads of State on July 4, 2023, in a virtual format, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif participated, demonstrating Pakistan’s willingness to engage despite the strained bilateral relations with India.

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephonic conversation with Chief Adviser of Bangladesh Professor Muhammad Yunus on Friday wherein the two leaders agreed that there was a need to work closely for the progress and prosperity of the people of both countries. Both leaders also agreed during the conversation that greater regional cooperation could play a vital role in uplifting the lives of the people of South Asia, according to a statement issued by the PM Office. The premier congratulated Yunus on assuming the office of chief adviser and lauded his contribution to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh. He expressed sympathies over the devastation caused by the recent floods in the country. Moreover, the prime minister underscored the importance of revitalising bilateral relations through enhanced cooperation in different domains. Noting the historical, religious and cultural bonds between Pakistan and Bangladesh, he expressed a keen desire to boost commercial relations, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts. The rare contact between the leaders of the two states came only days after PM Shehbaz offered Pakistan's all-out support to Bangladesh after the relentless monsoon rains and subsequent flooding that affected millions in the South Asian country. More than a dozen people have been killed in the neighbouring country while 4.5 million affected by floods following heavy rains, the disaster management and relief ministry said. The prime minister offered the support in a letter written to Yunus. The hopes for improvement in the ties between the two countries were rekindled following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as a result of the student-led protests turning into a mass uprising that caused her to resign earlier this month. More than 1,000 people also lost their lives in the violent protests that began against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding Hasina's ouster, she resigned and fled the country. Jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup."

  "content": "Incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan has slammed the doors shut on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) deserters, saying there is no room for those who abandoned the party during difficult times.  Speaking to journalists in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday, the PTI founder clearly stated that there was no space for those who left the party in challenging times.  \"I know who abandoned us during difficult times. Those who were active during good times but left during hardships have no place in the party,\" he added.  However, the deposed premier said, those who endured violence — which according to him included torture of their families and blackmailing — in difficult times but did not leave the party should rest assured. After the violent protests of May 9, 2023, several PTI leaders including the party’s bigwigs parted ways with Khan, while several others were detained by authorities over their alleged involvement in the mayhem. The May 9 incidents, refer to the violent protests, that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in a corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. A few months later and ahead of the February 8 elections, reports had emerged that some deserters desired to join the party's ranks once more, but the PTI leadership categorically denied taking anyone back. Most prominently, former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry — who is also a strong critic of current PTI leadership — expressed a desire to rejoin the party’s fold, which was denied by the party’s core committee. The PTI core committee “strongly condemns” those politicians who parted ways during the difficult time, a resolution read, adding that such politicians have no moral rights or powers to comment on the party affairs. The ex-Imran's aide, on May 24 last year announced “taking a break from politics” and parting ways with PTI over the May 9 mayhem when party workers and supporters allegedly attacked public and military installations almost across the country immediately after the arrest of the PTI founder. A group of disgruntled PTI leaders also formed a separate political party — Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) led by Jahangir Tareen. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than a year after he was booked in a plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case. Despite securing relief in several cases, the PTI founder remains behind bars after he was booked in a new Toshakhana case and other cases related to the May 9 mayhem."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Calling the August 26 attacks in Balochistan \"completely planned,\" Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi on Friday said that the incident was a “plot to sabotage” upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be hosted by Pakistan next month. Balochistan faced a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In one of the deadliest attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to host SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting from October 15-16. In this regard, Islamabad extended invitations to all heads of government of the member states, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite strained ties. Speaking on the floor of the Senate today, the interior minister said that the Balochistan attacks were carried out by “two to three terrorist organisations”. “A lot of people are in anguish as they don't want Pakistan to host the [SCO] meeting,” he said, adding that the August 26 incident was a “conspiracy to sabotage the summit”. Naqvi further said that no operation was being launched in Balochistan while “stringent action would be taken against those who did not accept the state and took up arms”. He also said that the apex committee reviewed the decisions related to the National Action Plan (NAP) and coordinated with the federal and provincial institutions, adding: “Parliament is supreme and will remain supreme.” Giving details of the Thursday's meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Quetta, the minister said that dialogue could only be held with those who respect the Constitution of Pakistan and salute the national flag. He said the meeting decided to provide Rs5 billion to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) to enhance capacity against terrorism while Rs8 billion including Rs1 billion would be given to each division of the province for the development which would be spent with their local parliamentarians recommendations. The security czar said that to overcome the shortage of federal government employees as many as 30 to 40 officials would be deputed in the province within two days. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. — With additional input from APP"

  "content": "Pakistan, in the current financial year, earned $46.7 million in mango exports, the Ministry of Commerce on Friday revealed in a report presented before the National Assembly. According to the ministry, Pakistan exported the sweet tropical fruit to at least 42 countries around the world with 13,681 metric tons of export volume. In the lower house session today, the commerce ministry said the United Kingdom was the largest importer of Pakistani mangoes this year with the country buying the fruit worth $13.2 million followed by the UAE at $9.2 million. Other countries that imported the sweet tropical fruit from Pakistan included Germany, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. Germany bought at least $1.9 million worth of the fruit, Oman imported mangoes worth $1.7 million, Saudi Arabia stood at $1.3 million, while mangoes worth $2.2 million were also exported to Afghanistan. The exports from the aforementioned countries collectively accounted for at least $4.4 million. Earlier this year, the All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (APFVEA) feared Pakistan wouldn't meet its export target for mangoes owing to the impact of climate change in the country. APFVEA patron-in-chief Mian Waheed Ahmed was of the view that the effects of climate change emerged as the biggest threat to mango production, which could be gauged from the fact that mango production had declined for the third year in a row. Pakistan produces 1.8 million metric tons of mangoes and of that, 70% is produced in the Punjab, 29% in Sindh and 1% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Due to climate change this year, however, the production of the fruit in Punjab was 35% to 40%, while in Sindh it was less than 20%. Therefore, the total production was feared to be reduced by 600,000 metric tons. Speaking with The News in July this year, Ahmed said long winters, rains and hailstorms followed by a severe heatwave have changed the pattern of agricultural diseases with the season. "

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the security personnel have launched extensive intelligence based operations (IBOs) to hunt the culprits involved in the fresh terrorist attacks in the province. According to the military's media wing, the operations are being conducted in the backdrop of cowardly terrorist activities that targeted innocent civilians across Balochistan on August 26.  \"On night August 29-30, in three separate IBOs in District Kech, Panjgur and Zhob, five terrorists were sent to hell by the security forces, while three terrorists got injured during the intense fire exchange,\" said the statement.  Moreover, sanitisation operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abetters of these atrocious acts are brought to justice, it added.  The statement further mentioned that the forces, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.

  "content": "KARACHI: The deep depression, which is gradually moving towards the Arabian Sea from India's Rann of Kutch, is now 170 kilometres southeast of the port city, the Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD) warned Friday. In its latest alert regarding the deep depression, the PMD said that the low-pressure area is now located approximately 170 kilometres southeast of the port city. It further stated that it lies around Latitude 23.5 N & Longitude 67.9 E at about 170km south/southeast of Karachi and 88km south of Kati Bandar. It is expected to move west-southwestward along Sindh's coastal belt and may intensify into a cyclonic storm upon entering the Arabian Sea by today afternoon or evening, subject to favourable environmental conditions. PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan said in a press conference that the cyclone namely Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which may result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas.  \"Cyclones usually advance from sea to land but Asna's advancement is vice versa [...] It will intensify into a hurricane whose impacts will be seen in the next week,\" he added. \"Our country is receiving more than usual downpours due to this cyclone. Upper areas of the country will experience more rain from September 2 to 4.\" Mehar predicted that the weather conditions would improve in southern areas after two days. Furthermore, the PMD has also forecast a possibility of heavy rainfall in the provincial capital of Sindh with strong winds and thundershowers in the next 24 hours. The meteorology department's forecast on Friday recorded the minimum temperature in the metropolis at 26°C while the maximum temperature in the city is likely to be 28°C to 30°C.

Heavy rains may cause water logging or rain inundation in low lying areas of the Sindh-Makran coast while sea conditions are likely to remain rough with squally winds of 60-70kph gusting 80kph. The PMD has advised fishermen in Sindh to avoid venturing into the sea till August 31 and those of Balochistan till September 1 while residents are advised to avoid unnecessary movement.

  "content": "Days after Balochistan was marred by terrorism, the United States Department of Defence \"strongly condemned\" the series of terrorist attacks in the province that resulted in the tragic loss of lives, including those of civilians and security personnel. Commenting on the heinous attacks in the country's southwestern province, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said: \"We strongly condemn any terrorist attack like that and of course our thoughts are with those who lost their lives during that attack.\" When questioned about Washington's support to Islamabad in fighting against such terror groups in the province, the Pentagon official said she not aware of any current US involvement or assistance to Pakistan in this matter. \"But if that changes, I can certainly let you know,\" she added, addressing a press briefing at the Pentagon on Thursday. Singh's statement comes in the wake of the recent bloodshed in Balochistan where over 50 people were martyred in different terrorist attacks. In response to the series of horrific attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the provincial capital on Thursday and vowed to completely eradicate terrorism from the province at all costs, saying the \"blood of martyrs will not go in vain\". The press secretary, when responding to another question on whether the US can help Pakistan in rooting out terrorism from that region, said that Washington is always willing to work with any nation that wants to root out a terrorist organisation. \"We have good cooperation with the Pakistani government. But in terms of these attacks, I just — I don't have anything for you other than that we, of course, condemn them,\" said Singh. She maintained that the US defence department would update on any change in decisions with regards to the American government's cooperation with the Pakistani government. In one of the deadliest attacks on Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Adiala jail administration on Friday refuted the claims about Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan's facilities withdrawn in the prison, as the party asserted that founder was facing difficulties owing to inadequate amenities. Khan had access to all the facilities listed in the jail manual, with special consideration given to his security and health condition, according to the superintendent of Central Jail Rawalpindi, also known as the Adiala jail. \"One English newspaper is sent to the PTI founder every day. To stay in shape, he has a place to walk and an exercise machine,\" he remarked. The jail official added that the former prime minister and his incarcerated spouse, Bushra Bibi, had been allocated a separate kitchen, while prison staff was present 24/7 for his security. The Adiala jail superintendent said books were also available for him to read. The official repudiated the report about an open sewer in Khan’s cell and rats in Bushra Bibi’s cell, saying: \"There is no veracity in the news of an open sewer in Khan’s cell or rats in Bushra’s.\" The official said the PTI founder was allowed to meet family, lawyers as well as hold political meetings twice a week. Also on the occasion of case hearings the PTI founder met those who attended the hearings in the jail, the official maintained. The jail official said Khan also had the facility of television in his prison cell. The jail's stance comes in the wake of claims made by PTI Senator Muhammad Ali Khan Saif who relayed media about a spectrum of \"facilities\" his leader is being deprived of. The senator said he called on Khan at the prison and found he was encountering adversities there. The PTI founder was not given the facilities that President Asif Ali Zardari and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif enjoyed during their respective jail terms, he maintained. “The PTI founder is suffering from ear pain. He’s not being provided an electric toothbrush and a dumbbell for exercise,” he said. Saif said the ex-premier was not being allowed to talk to his sons as well over the phone. He conveyed the workers' sentiments to the PTI supremo, saying that they were dejected after the August 22 public rally was postponed abruptly. The PTI founder directed him to make the party leaders sit down and resolve grievances, he said."

Almost a week after he formally assumed his new diplomatic responsibilities in Washington, Rizwan attended the ceremony at the US Department of State, according to the statement. Top US diplomats, including Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Horst, attended the ceremony. Speaking to the attendees at the ceremony, the new Pakistan envoy to the US vowed to contributing to cementing Pak-US bilateral ties to the best of his abilities. He particularly emphasised the significance of enhancing the frequency of \"high level interaction, economic linkages and people-to-people contacts between the two countries\". Last week, as he assumed his new responsibilities, Rizwan held introductory meetings with officers from the embassy and discussed priorities in the context of Pakistan's economic situation. Rizwan, who previously served as the deputy chief of Mission at the Pakistan Embassy for a long time, has held diplomatic responsibilities with former ambassadors Jalil Abbas Jilani, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Asad Majeed Khan, and Ali Jahangir Siddiqui.

  "content": "KARACHI: Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Ali Naqvi has announced the closure of all public and private schools in Karachi today (Friday) following the prediction of heavy rain.   In a statement, the Karachi commissioner said the decision has been taken after consulting the Met Office and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). The development came as Karachi has been experiencing intermittent rainfall since Wednesday with the heavy rain expected to lash the metropolis in the next few hours. The strong monsoon system near Tharparkar and India’s Rann of Kutch may penetrate into Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts, bringing torrential rains with thunderstorm, the Met Office said on Wednesday. It had said Karachi was likely to receive from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain in the next three days. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of intermittent rain in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, until August 31, with strong winds and thunderstorms, and heavy downpours in some places. Speaking during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', PMD Meteorologist Anjum Nazir Zaighum said a strong weather system was still present 270 km away from Karachi in the north-east. “The weather system will increase its intensity marginally, when it will reach the Arabian Sea, and form a cyclone storm for about one and a half days,” he warned. In the Arabian Sea, Zaigham maintained, an average cyclone lasted for three to four days. The weather department, in its daily report, said wind was blowing at a speed of 13km from south-western side in the port city. Meanwhile, schools in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal, Badin, Tandwalayar, Sanghar will remain closed on Friday, owing to the rain forecast. "

  "content": "KARACHI: In a major development, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab has warned the citizens against “unnecessary movement” as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted heavy rains in the metropolis due to a potential cyclone that is likely to emerge along the Sindh coast by today (Friday) morning. Taking to X, Murtaza pointed out that it has been raining since last three days and in the next few hours, it is expected that \"there will be heavier rainfall with strong winds\". \"I would urge the residents of Karachi especially bike riders to avoid unnecessary movement. Stay safe everyone & in case of any emergency call 1339,\" he wrote. According to an alert issued by the Met Office on Thursday night, the deep depression or very strong low-pressure area over Rann of Kutch, India has slowly moved west/southwestward during last 12 hours and now lies at around Latitude 23.6 N & Longitude 69.2 E at about 250km east/southeast of Karachi. “The system is likely keep moving further west/southwestwards, emerge into northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh coast by tomorrow (Friday) morning and intensify further into a Cyclonic Storm (CS) due to favorable environmental conditions, sea surface temperature, low/moderate vertical wind shear and upper-level divergence,” it stated. Under its influence, the PMD forecast widespread rain/wind-thunderstorms with scattered heavy/very heavy and isolated extremely heavy falls in Karachi division, Tharparker, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, TM Khan, TA Yar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts till August 31. Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorm with scattered heavy/very heavy falls also likely in Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Keach & Gwadar districts during 30 August to 1st September with occasional gaps, read the statement. Such torrential rains may trigger pluvial flood or inundation in low lying areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. It may also cause flash flooding in hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and local nullahs and streams of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad, Sibbi, Naseerabad, Barkhan, Loralai, Awaran, Panjgur, Washuk, Mastung and Lasbella. Heavy rains may also trigger landslides in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. “Sea conditions are likely to remain rough/very rough with squally winds 50-60 km/hour gusting 70 km/hour,” it said, advising the fishermen of Sindh not to venture into sea till 31 August and those of Balochistan till 1st September. The Met Office noted that PMD’s cyclone warning center, Karachi is closely monitoring the system and will issue the update accordingly. “The concerned authorities are requested to keep them abreast through PMD advisory.” Earlier today, PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz indicated that if the low-pressure system does develop into a cyclonic storm, it will be named \"Asna\", which means \"highest\" and \"brighter\". A cyclonic storm during the monsoon season is very unusual, Sarfaraz said, noting that this is the first time since 1961 that such a weather system is directed towards Sindh's coastal belt from Central India. \"During monsoon, there is approximately 1% or 2% chance for a depression or low pressure to turn into a cyclonic storm or tropical cyclone.\" meteorologist Anjum Nazir told Geo News. In light of the cyclone alert issued by the PMD and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) today, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has instructed all relevant departments, including the administration and the municipal bodies, to heighten their responsiveness to potential disasters. Additionally, all hospitals have been directed to enhance their management and ensure the attendance of their staff. Furthermore, the chief minister also directed the Fisheries department to issue instructions for fishermen and ordered the Irrigation department to monitor the dams of rivers, canals and other water passages. Issuing an alert to relevant departments, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) anticipated more \"heavy to very heavy rain\" clubbed with wind/thunderstorms in parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan within the next 24 to 72 hours. Rainfall is likely to exceed 100mm in most parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, a statement read, adding that heavy downpours are expected to trigger urban flooding in urban centre, including Karachi and Hyderabad, as well as flash flooding in local nullahs and river tributaries. It also predicted heavy rainfall in Punjab and Balochistan that could cause urban flooding in urban centres, floods in hill torrents in both provinces and high river flows. The NDMA urged all relevant authorities and the public to take necessary precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of flooding and heavy rains. It issued instructions to alert Emergency Response Teams and mobilise resources to ensure a swift response to any arising situations. The public is advised to remain vigilant and follow instructions from local authorities."

  "content": " Security forces have neutralised at least 12 terrorists during the intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Tirah Valley, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Friday. \"Since 20 August 2024, security forces are conducting extensive intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Tirah Valley, Khyber District, on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" said the military's media affairs wing in a statement.  On August 28 and 29, troops effectively engaged the terrorists' locations where after intense fire exchange, 12 militants of \"Fitna-Al-Khwarij were sent to hell,\" the military's media wing said while referring to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants. The statement further said that these operations have resulted in a major setback to the TTP and its affiliates, adding that so far, 37 terrorists have been \"sent to hell\", while 14 others have suffered serious injuries. The military reaffirmed its commitment to restoring peace, saying that the IBOs will continue till peace is restored in the area and terrorists are eliminated, as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country. Earlier today, at least five terrorists were killed and three others injured during separate IBOs in Balochistan's Kech, Panjgur and Zhob districts.  A statement issued by the ISPR said the security forces are conducting extensive IBOs to hunt down the perpetrators of the Balochistan incident. According to the military's media wing, the operations are being conducted in the backdrop of cowardly terrorist activities that targeted innocent civilians across Balochistan on August 26.  \"On night August 29-30, in three separate IBOs in District Kech, Panjgur and Zhob, five terrorists were sent to hell by the security forces, while three terrorists got injured during the intense fire exchange,\" said the statement.  Moreover, sanitisation operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abetters of these atrocious acts are brought to justice, it added.  The IBOs were launched after at least 23 passengers on Monday were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday held a telephonic conversation with Chief Adviser of Bangladesh Professor Muhammad Yunus wherein the two leaders agreed that there was a need to work closely for the progress and prosperity of the people of both countries. During the conversation, both leaders also agreed that greater regional cooperation could play a vital role in uplifting the lives of the people of South Asia, according to a statement issued by the PM Office. The premier congratulated Yunus on assuming the office of chief adviser and lauded his contribution to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh. He expressed sympathies over the devastation caused by the recent floods in the country. Moreover, the prime minister underscored the importance of revitalising bilateral relations through enhanced cooperation in different domains. Noting the historical, religious and cultural bonds between Pakistan and Bangladesh, he expressed a keen desire to boost commercial relations, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts. The rare contact between the leaders of the two states came only days after PM Shehbaz offered Pakistan's all-out support to Bangladesh after the relentless monsoon rains and subsequent flooding that affected millions in the South Asian country. More than a dozen people have been killed in the neighbouring country while 4.5 million affected by floods following heavy rains, the disaster management and relief ministry said. The prime minister offered the support in a letter written to Yunus. The hopes for improvement in the ties between the two countries were rekindled following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as a result of the student-led protests turning into a mass uprising that caused her to resign earlier this month. More than 1,000 people also lost their lives in the violent protests that began against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding Hasina's ouster, she resigned and fled the country. Jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup."

  "content": "    The federal cabinet has approved starting negotiations on the Financial Commitment Agreement between China and Pakistan Railways to upgrade the long-awaited Mainline-1 (ML-1) project — a crucial component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad on Friday, instructed that the final agreement on the state-of-the-art railway project be brought back to the cabinet for approval. The ML-1 is one of the strategic projects between both countries for the development of infrastructure after the federal government approved the annual plan for budget 2024-25 in June to kick-start implementation of the second phase of the CPEC. Under the plan, the government will focus on bilateral cooperation in diverse sectors including industry, agriculture modernisation, socioeconomic development, scientific collaboration, infrastructure and energy, The News reported. The railway project consists of three phases having a total length of 1,726km, once implemented, is expected to considerably improve the logistics performance of the country. It is the commitment of the Chinese side they will consider providing financing support, including loans with favourable terms, for this strategic project. The financing scheme shall be negotiated and agreed upon by the relevant departments of both sides. The upgraded ML-1 is designed for 160km/hr on the upgraded track, while its operational speed is set at 120km/h. The existing line capacity of ML-1 will be enhanced from 34 to 120 trains per day, addressing future population growth with a forward-looking approach. Upgraded ML-1 will seamlessly combine speed, reliability and capacity in rail transportation. The passenger handling capacity of ML-1, at its optimum, will be boosted from the existing 29 million to 170 million, and freight capacity from 8 to 43 million tons. Realistically speaking, the envisaged upgradation of ML-1 will meet passenger and freight requirements for about 25 to 30 years. There are certain observations of relevant ministries. The PC-I of ML-1 does not include the scope and cost of the rolling stock and security infrastructure of ML-1, the publication said, adding that another PC-I of around Rs36 billion is under process for the purpose of security. The prime minister briefed the cabinet on his recent visit to Quetta, highlighting ongoing efforts to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies, such as the police and levies, in Balochistan. “This is for sure, the armed forces and the law enforcement agencies will collectively make them (terrorists) an example. Without this, the country’s journey of progress and prosperity cannot be accomplished. We have unity of thought and action on this,” he remarked addressing the meeting. PM Shehbaz said that the provincial government and the political leaders unanimously viewed that any talks with the anti-state elements were out of the question. He said the family members of the martyrs he interacted with during his visit, were in high morale despite losing their dear ones in the terrorist incident. The premier said the federal government would implement the proposals put forward by the provincial political leaders during his visit. He told the cabinet members that during the visit, the Quetta Corps Commander gave a presentation on challenges faced by Balochistan and how the terrorists, funded by foreign forces, were sowing hatred against Pakistan among the people. He said the civilian government was also taking effective measures for the youth's uplift. Besides, the officers and the personnel of the armed forces were chasing the terrorists with the federal government’s support, he said and assured the federal government’s support for the capacity building of Levies. He said a 10% additional quota had been allocated for Balochistan in schemes like laptops and agricultural training in China. Besides, the federal government would spend Rs55 billion to solarise agricultural tube wells in Balochistan. He also praised the Balochistan provincial government for its commendable efforts to integrate Baloch youth into the national mainstream, aiming for their development and prosperity. The prime minister said that the federal government will fully support the Balochistan government in offering world-class education and equal development opportunities to Baloch youth. The prime minister said that Moody’s has recently upgraded Pakistan’s rating to indicate the country’s improving economic condition. “This is a long journey. This yet needs more concerted efforts to improve the economy. The whole nation, including the provincial governments, are united on this.\" Prime Minister Shehbaz said that the federal government would soon unveil its five-year Home Grown Economic Revival Plan aimed at boosting exports, agriculture, industry, youth’s uplift, skill and vocational training. “We have to take this journey ahead. The nations who work hard and face challenges resolutely achieve excellence. Pakistan will soon achieve economic independence and emerge as an economic power as there is no other way out,” he added. The cabinet also approved the decisions made by the Economic Coordination Committee on August 29, 2024."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: British High Commissioner Jane Marriott has invited Pakistani students looking for scholarships at the United Kingdom universities to apply for the Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship programmes. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the Commonwealth Scholarship programme as 46 Chevening and 47 Commonwealth scholarships have been awarded to Pakistanis, according to an official statement issued from the British High Commission in Islamabad on Friday. These long-standing programmes have developed a network of over 1,500 Commonwealth and nearly 2,000 Chevening alumni in Pakistan, who regularly meet to discuss live issues, it added. The statement further stated that scholars come from diverse backgrounds, representing the rich cultural tapestry of Pakistan, adding that this year’s cohort come from Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, Pakistan Administered Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and the Federal Capital Territory. Over 60% of this year’s Chevening scholars are women. The British High Commission strongly encourages people from all backgrounds and across Pakistan to apply. Talking to the students, the high commissioner offered advice to them for living in the UK, ahead of a year of studying at British universities. She said, “The Chevening programme helps develop a new generation of Pakistani leaders and change-makers. Many of our alumni have gone on to achieve extraordinary things back home.\" \"Not only do they get the benefit of studying at some of the best universities in the world, they also get to experience the best of living in the UK. From climate studies to football coaching, I am looking forward to seeing what they achieve, and encourage all those interested to apply early.” Fareeha Gull Hashmi, Assistant Manager of Oral History Project Citizens Archive of Pakistan and upcoming Chevening scholar, said: “I am thrilled to be joining the University of Essex for my MA in Heritage and Museum Studies. This programme is exactly what I was looking for to help me on my journey to improve heritage and cultural preservation in Pakistan. I can’t wait for my journey to begin.” The cohort includes those on a scholarship in Football Science, with the support of Swindon Town Football Club.  For the first time, this year’s cohort also saw an additional scholarship for Heritage and Museum Studies with the support of Essex University. This scholarship will cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs. This, and a University of Essex Scholarship for Climate Studies, are again available in this year’s application cycle, as are additional scholarships from the University of Birmingham. This month, the British High Commission launched Chevening Connect in Karachi, a new debate series bringing together industry experts and Chevening alumni.

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi on Friday said that the horrific attacks in Balochistan, wherein dozens including security personnel lost their lives, was a “plot to subvert” upcoming  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be hosted by Pakistan next month. Balochistan, on August 26, faced a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In one of the deadliest attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Amid the latest terror incidents, Pakistan is set to host SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting from October 15-16.  In this regard, Islamabad extended invitations to all heads of government of the member states, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite strained ties.  Speaking on the floor of the Senate today, the interior minister said that the “completely-planned” Balochistan attacks were carried out by “two to three terrorist organisations”. “A lot of people are in anguish as they don't want Pakistan to host the [SCO] meeting,” he said, adding that the August 26 incident was a “conspiracy to sabotage the summit”. Naqvi further said that no operation was being launched in Balochistan while “stringent action would be taken against those who did not accept the state and took up arms”. He also said that the apex committee reviewed the decisions related to the National Action Plan (NAP) and coordinated with the federal and provincial institutions, adding: “Parliament is supreme and will remain supreme.” Giving details of the Thursday's meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Quetta, the minister said that dialogue could only be held with those who respect the Constitution of Pakistan and salute the national flag. He said the meeting decided to provide Rs5 billion to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) to enhance capacity against terrorism while Rs8 billion including Rs1 billion would be given to each division of the province for the development which would be spent with their local parliamentarians recommendations. The security czar said that to overcome the shortage of federal government employees as many as 30 to 40 officials would be deputed in the province within two days. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran.

After the violent protests of May 9, 2023, several PTI leaders including the party’s bigwigs parted ways with Khan, while several others were detained by authorities over their alleged involvement in the mayhem. The May 9 incidents refer to the violent protests that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. A few months later and ahead of the February 8 elections, reports had emerged that some deserters desired to join the party's ranks once more, but the PTI leadership categorically denied taking anyone back. Most prominently, former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry — who is also a strong critic of current PTI leadership — expressed desire to rejoin party’s fold, which was denied by the party’s core committee.  The PTI core committee “strongly condemns” those politicians who parted ways during the difficult time, a resolution read, adding that such politicians have no moral rights or powers to comment on the party affairs. The ex-Imran's aide, on May 24 last year announced “taking a break from politics” and parting ways with PTI over the May 9 mayhem when party workers and supporters allegedly attacked public and military installations almost across the country immediately after the arrest of the PTI founder. A group of disgruntled PTI leaders also formed a separate political party — Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) led by Jahangir Tareen. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than a year after he was booked in plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case. Despite securing relief in several cases, the PTI founder remains behind bars after he was booked in new Toshakhana case and other cases related to May 9 mayhem.  "

  "content": "Pakistani mangoes are not just popular locally but are famous around the world for their sweet and delicious flavours with their exports generating profits for the growers annually. This year around, mangoes from Pakistan were exported to at least 42 countries around the globe, earning the country $46.7 million in exports, the Ministry of Commerce said. However, which country consumed the most Pakistani mangoes was revealed during the National Assembly session on Friday. In the lower house session, the commerce ministry said the United Kingdom was the largest importer of Pakistani mangoes this year with the country buying the fruit worth $13.2 million followed by the UAE at $9.2 million. Other countries that imported the sweet tropical fruit from Pakistan included Germany, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. Germany bought at least $1.9 million worth of the fruit, Oman imported mangoes worth $1.7 million, Saudi Arabia stood at $1.3 million, while mangoes worth $2.2 million were also exported to Afghanistan. The exports from the aforementioned countries collectively accounted for at least $4.4 million. According to the Ministry of Commerce, Pakistan earned at least $46.7 million by exporting mangoes to 42 nations in the current financial year, while the export volume stood at 13,681 metric tons. Earlier this year, the All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (APFVEA) feared Pakistan wouldn't meet its export target for mangoes owing to the impact of climate change in the country. APFVEA patron-in-chief Mian Waheed Ahmed was of the view that the effects of climate change emerged as the biggest threat to mango production, which could be gauged from the fact that mango production had declined for the third year in a row. Pakistan produces 1.8 million metric tons of mangoes and of that, 70% is produced in the Punjab, 29% in Sindh and 1% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Due to climate change this year, however, the production of the fruit in Punjab was 35% to 40%, while in Sindh it was less than 20%. Therefore, the total production was feared to be reduced by 600,000 metric tons. Speaking with The News in July this year, Ahmed said long winters, rains and hailstorms followed by a severe heatwave have changed the pattern of agricultural diseases with the season. "

  "content": "KARACHI: After a deep depression moved further closer towards Sindh in the Arabian Sea, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Friday warned fishermen and sailors not to venture into the sea until Sunday. The weather office said the depression could develop into a cyclonic storm, causing flooding in cities as well as flash floods in hilly areas in coming days.  Heavy rains and stormy winds have already battered a slew of districts in different parts of the country.  The PMD in its warning said the fishermen of Sindh should not venture into the sea till August 31 and fishers of Balochistan till September 1, owing to the threat of rough sea.  The department said Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta and other districts of Sindh were expected to experience intermittent heavy downpours till August 31. Whereas, added, Hub, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech and Gwadar districts might witness torrential showers till Sunday.  Meanwhile, issuing its third alert for the tropical cyclone, the Met Office said the deep depression was present near India’s Rann of Kutch and its adjacent areas. “The system has been moving towards west and south-west, though slowly, during the last 12 hours,” it said. The PMD said the system was located 200 kilometers east and southeast of Karachi.  “This system will continue to move further west and southwest. The system may enter the Arabian Sea and adjoining Indus coastline by evening today,” the meteorological department said. It said because of this system there would be severe flooding in the sea, as winds in the sea are already blowing at 50 to 60 km an hour with gusts of 70 kmph."

According to the PMD, this deep depression — a very strong low-pressure area — is expected to keep moving west-southwestward along Sindh's coastal belt. It further stated that it lies around Latitude 23.5 N & Longitude 67.9 E at about 170km south/southeast of Karachi and 88km south of Kati Bandar. The low pressure area may further intensify into a cyclonic storm upon entering the Arabian Sea by today afternoon or evening, if environmental conditions remain favourable, the PMD said in its latest cyclone alert.

Upper areas of the country will experience more rain from September 2 to 4.\" Mehar predicted that the weather conditions would improve in southern areas after two days.

  "content": "The United States Department of Defence has \"strongly condemned\" the recent attack on Balochistan days after the province was marred by terror leaving dozens of civilians and security forces martyred. Responding to a question regarding the Washington's support to Islamabad in dealing with such terrorist groups, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said she was not aware of any US involvement or assistance to Pakistan at this time. \"But if that changes, I can certainly let you know,\" she maintained. \"We strongly condemn any terrorist attack like that and of course our thoughts are with those who lost their lives during that attack, but I don't have anything beyond that,\" said Singh, addressing a press briefing at the Pentagon on Thursday. Singh's statement comes in the wake of the recent bloodshed in Balochistan where over 50 people were martyred in different terrorist attacks. In response to the series of horrific attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the provincial capital on Thursday and vowed to completely eradicate terrorism from the province at all costs, saying the \"blood of martyrs will not go in vain\". The press secretary, when responding to another question on whether the US can help Pakistan in rooting out terrorism from that region, said that Washington is always willing to work with any nation that wants to root out a terrorist organisation. \"We have good cooperation with the Pakistani government. But in terms of these attacks, I just — I don't have anything for you other than that we, of course, condemn them,\" said Singh. She maintained that the US defence department would update on any change in decisions with regards to the American government's cooperation with the Pakistani government. In one of the deadliest attacks on Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Adiala jail administration on Friday denied reports about withdrawing facilities for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, while the party is insistent he is facing hardships citing a lack of due facilities. The superintendent of Central Jail Rawalpindi, famously referred to as the Adiala jail, said all the facilities as per the jail manual were available to Khan, with special attention on his security and health.  “The PTI founder is supplied one English newspaper daily. He has an exercise machine and place for walk [to keep him fit],” he said. The jail official added that the former prime minister and his incarcerated spouse, Bushra Bibi, had been allocated a separate kitchen, while prison staff was present 24/7 for his security.  The Adiala jail superintendent said books were also available for him to read.  The official repudiated the report about an open sewer in Khan’s cell and rats in Bushra Bibi’s cell, saying: \"There is no veracity in the news of an open sewer in Khan’s cell or rats in Bushra’s.\" The official said the PTI founder was allowed to meet family, lawyers as well as hold political meetings twice a week. Also on the occasion of case hearings the PTI founder met those who attended the hearings in the jail, the official maintained. The jail official said Khan also had the facility of television in his prison cell. The jail's stance comes in the wake of claims made by PTI Senator Muhammad Ali Khan Saif who relayed media about a spectrum of \"facilities\" his leader is being deprived of. The senator said he called on Khan at the prison and found he was encountering adversities there. The PTI founder was not given the facilities that President Asif Ali Zardari and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif enjoyed during their respective jail terms, he maintained. “The PTI founder is suffering from ear pain. He’s not being provided an electric toothbrush and a dumbbell for exercise,” he said. Saif said the ex-premier was not being allowed to talk to his sons as well over the phone. He conveyed the workers' sentiments to the PTI supremo, saying that they were dejected after the August 22 public rally was postponed abruptly. The PTI founder directed him to make the party leaders sit down and resolve grievances, he said. "

  "content": "KARACHI: The local authorities have announced the closure of all public and private schools in Karachi today (Friday) amid heavy rain forecast. In a statement on late Thursday, Karachi Commissioner Hassan Ali Naqvi said the decision has been taken after consulting the Met Office and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). The development came as Karachi has been experiencing intermittent rainfall since Wednesday with the heavy rain expected to lash the metropolis in the next few hours. The strong monsoon system near Tharparkar and India’s Rann of Kutch may penetrate into Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts, bringing torrential rains with thunderstorm, the Met Office said on Wednesday. It had said Karachi was likely to receive from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain in the next three days. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of intermittent rain in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, until August 31, with strong winds and thunderstorms, and heavy downpours in some places. Speaking during Geo News programme 'Geo Pakistan', PMD Meteorologist Anjum Nazir Zaighum said a strong weather system was still present 270 km away from Karachi in the north-east. “The weather system will increase its intensity marginally, when it will reach the Arabian Sea, and form a cyclone storm for about one and a half days,” he warned. In the Arabian Sea, Zaigham maintained, an average cyclone lasted for three to four days. The weather department, in its daily report, said wind was blowing at a speed of 13km from south-western side in the port city. Meanwhile, schools in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal, Badin, Tandwalayar, Sanghar will remain closed on Friday, owing to the rain forecast."

PIDPremier says terrorism reared its head again after 2018.\"Terrorist outfits, Khawarij and facilitators hatched terror plot.\"Vows all obstacles in Balcohistan&rsquo;s...",
  "content": "QUETTA: In response to a series of horrific attacks in Balochistan that resulted in over 50 deaths, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the provincial capital on Thursday and vowed to completely eradicate terrorism from the province at all costs, saying the \"blood of martyrs will not go in vain\". The premier made these remarks while chairing a high-level meeting of the National Action Plan’s provincial apex committee.  Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, security czar Mohsin Naqvi, federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Attaullah Tarar, Jam Kamal, corps commander , and other armed and civilian officials were in attendance. The prime minister's visit to Quetta comes against the backdrop of recent bloodshed in the country's largest province by land wherein over 50 people, including 14 security personnel, were martyred in different terrorist attacks in Balochistan. In one of the deadliest attacks on Monday, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. The recent bloodshed has resulted in a strong reaction from both the federal and provincial governments with PM Shehbaz ruling out dialogue and a \"soft approach\" in dealing with the enemy. Terming the incidents “tragic and barbaric” today, the prime minister said all terrorist organisations, the \"Khawarij\" and facilitators hatched the terror plot which resulted in martyrdom of innocent civilians and security personnel.    “The entire nation is grieved by the recent tragic incident occurred in Balochistan. Khawarij who shed the blood of innocent people will be crushed through joint efforts of the nation and the valiant forces of Pakistan,” he said. Balochistan is an important and beautiful province of Pakistan, the premier noted, saying that all obstacles in its path to development and prosperity will be removed for good. PM Shehbaz noted that terrorism had reared its head again after 2018, reiterating the government’s determination to crush those involved in the ghastly bloodshed.  Expressing his great trust in the professional capabilities of the armed and civilian forces, he said under the guidance of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, and with full cooperation from the federal government and the leadership of Balochistan, the terrorism will be rooted out. “Sacrifices of those who laid down their lives for the motherland and the innocent civilians will not go to waste”, the PM further remarked.  The prime minister stated that enemies of Pakistan want to hinder the progress of Balochistan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but “will not be succeeded”.  He also emphasised the need for collective efforts to eliminate terrorism from the province, ruling out any dialogue with the terrorists.  He added that eradication of terrorism was essential for the country’s prosperity. However, the premier said, talks should be held with those elements who believe in the Constitution and flag of Pakistan.  Furthermore, he noted that the government has chalked out a policy regarding appointment of “competent and talented officers” in Balochistan.  PM Shehbaz announced that 48 Common Training Programme officers will be deployed in the province for a year. “Half of the officers will be deployed immediately and remaining after six months,” he added.  He further announced incentives for officers deployed in the province, including air tickets for their families after every three months and additional three points for performance-based evaluations.  He also assured that the policy will be implemented in consultation with the Balochistan government. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan."

  "description": "Cyclone Asna has moved further southwestward during the last 12 hours weakened into a deep depression and is likely to move further southwestwards and weaken gradually, according to a notification from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued on Sunday. The cyclone now lies Northwest over the Arabian Sea and is 350km southwest of Ormara, 370km south of Gwadar and 340km east-southeast of Musqat, Oman, PDM said in its last notification on the cyclone.      Under the influence of its circulation, “sea conditions are likely to remain rough-very rough with squally winds of 40/50 kilometres per hour gusting 60km/h till tonight,” the notification said. While fishermen in Balochistan were advised not to venture into the open sea till tonight, those of Sindh were given the green light to resume their activities from today. Separately — in an update on 2:29pm — PMD informed that rain was expected in the Karachi division on Monday (September 2)  and Tuesday (September 3), adding that areas such as Sukkur, Larkano, Khairpur, Dadu, Jacobabad, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar could receive heavy downpour and lightning. “Farmers are advised to manage their activities keeping in view the weather forecast,” a statement from the Met Office said.      “Travelers and tourists are advised to remain extra cautious and manage their travelling according to weather conditions and avoid any untoward situation during the wet spell,” it added On Thursday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab warned citizens against unnecessary movement as more rain was expected due to a potential cyclone over the Rann of Kutch in India, which was likely to emerge along the Sindh coast  on Friday morning. According to a PMD alert issued at 10pm on Thursday, a deep depression over the Rann of Kutch had very slowly moved west/southwest over the past 12 hours and lay around 250 kilometres east/southeast of Karachi. On Friday, the deep depression was situated approximately 170 kilometres from Karachi, which made Pakistan’s coastal areas brace for rains as the storm system intensified into Cyclone Asna over the northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh’s coast. On Saturday, Cyclone Asna steered away from Pakistan’s coastline — lying about 370 kilometres away from Karachi — but residents of Balochistan’s coastal belt still braced for expected rains brought by the weather system.

  "description": "Police on Sunday confirmed to have arrested Karachi University (KU) professor and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed a day earlier over a case dating back to 2017, saying he was let go when it was proven that he was acquitted in the case. Following his release from detention on Saturday, Dr Ahmed had alleged that he was “abducted” to prevent him from attending a syndicate meeting which was supposed to decide the degree issue of a sitting judge of Islamabad High Court. He was released by the police after an outcry by teachers, students and rights activists who protested his eight-hour “detention” outside the Bahadurabad Police Station. Police spokesperson Syed Umair Shah told Dawn.com today, “Social media has launched a campaign that Professor Dr Riaz, who teaches at the chemistry department of the University of Karachi, was detained by Bahadurabad police without any justification and who was released later on.” Social media users claimed there were “some hidden and complex reasons” behind the arrest, the police added. Information was sought from Bahadurabad police to verify this but Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Naeem Rajput clarified that it was a “routine matter”, the statement reads. The SHO said he received information that an “absconder” named Riaz, wanted by Artillery Maidan Police Station in an FIR 35/2017, was present in the jurisdiction of Bahadurabad police. Therefore, police took Dr Ahmed into custody, where he clarified that he was a professor at KU and that he had been acquitted in the case against him, the police statement added. “There were no hidden aspects behind this matter.” Dr Ahmed, meanwhile, disputed the police statement and reiterated in a statement that he was abducted to prevent him from attending KU’s syndicate meeting, which discussed the degree issue of a sitting IHC judge. He urged Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice, claiming that an “injustice” was being carried out against a sitting IHC judge. He raised objections regarding the formation of the inquiry body and alleged that it was pursuing a one-sided inquiry/ The professor said that the meeting approved “an Unfair Means Committee report not commissioned by the syndicate”, deeming it “against the [Karachi] University Rules”.

  "description": "Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) may take to the streets itself and on issues of its own choosing but will not participate in any protests orchestrated by the PTI despite multiple rendezvous between the parties’ senior leadership, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza revealed in an interview on Saturday. On August 23, PTI leaders visited JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence, claiming that both the parties had decided to cooperate on an “issue to issue and agenda to agenda” basis. The two parties’ leaders met again days later.      As tensions rose, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari, also took turns visiting the JUI-F chief, who had announced a “solo flight” against the government. President Zardari called on the JUI-F chief a day after the Maulana reportedly agreed with the PTI to have a joint strategy to give a tough time to the government. PM Shehbaz also visited him on Friday to garner his support, urging him not to participate in any agitation campaign against the government. Some political experts consider the meeting to be a significant move, linking it with the upcoming National Assembly and Senate sessions, while others believe that the president might have tried to prevent the Maulana from announcing any agitation against the government and might have made some “offers” to him in return. While speaking on DawnNewsTV programme Doosra Rukh, Senator Murtaza said that the meetings with the prime minister and the president were “social” in nature.      “There were political conversations definitely, but you could call this more of a social meet than a political one,” Murtaza said. Regarding the conversations between PTI and JUI-F leaders, Murtaza said that in those sit-fowns JUI-F clarified to the opposition party the extent to which they would stand with them. The meeting was attended by Senator Shibli Faraz, Lawyer Gohar Khan and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Murtaza confirmed. “We have told them some things with clarity as to how far we would go with them and to what end we would not,” Murtaza said. He said that “the party (JUI-F) would protest on the streets on their issues but, for the time being, they won’t be party to another party’s protest.” "

  "description": "Pakistan’s fourth case of the mpox virus has been confirmed in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Public Health Director Dr Irshad Ali Roghani said on Sunday. The mpox virus presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, and children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications. Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the recent outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant of the virus, Clade 1b, was identified. The Clade 1b variant has triggered global concern due to the ease with which it spreads through routine close contact. However, the mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the WHO has said, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it. The first three cases of the virus were all found at the Peshawar  airport, with the fourth one confirmed today. “The medical team at Peshawar Airport transferred the patient (fourth case) to the Police and Services Hospital (PSH) after they showed symptoms during the screening,” Roghani said. “The rapid response team took samples from the patient’s wound in the hospital and sent it to the laboratory”. The Public Health Reference Laboratory confirmed mpox in the patient, he explained, adding that the patient was in a “stable condition” and was undergoing treatment“ at the hospital. The doctor confirmed that the patient belonged to the Peshawar district — with this being the fourth confirmed case of mpox in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “No local cases have been reported so far,” he stated, adding that the province’s health department had “created an integrated surveillance and response system for mpox”. The health ministry had clarified earlier that the first mpox case detected in Pakistan was of the clade 2 variety. A second case of mpox was confirmed last week, with the patient also detected at the Peshawar airport. The third case was confirmed on Saturday after medical personnel at Bacha Khan International Airport identified two travellers displaying symptoms of the mpox virus. The WHO sounded its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in DRC since the current outbreak began in January 2023. One case each of the clade 1b variant has been confirmed in Sweden and Thailand so far — the first signs of its spread outside the continent. However, the WHO has not urged any travel restrictions to curb the spread of mpox. The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, and children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications. "

  "description": "A landlord in Sargodha has admitted to killing his employee and burying him in a crop field after accusing him of theft last month, police said on Sunday. According to Sargodha police spokesperson Khurrum Iqbal, police at the Kot Momin police station received information on August 30 that an individual named Mazhar Iqbal had been kidnapped by his employer Amir on August 24. The police immediately registered a case of kidnapping and began searching for the suspect and the abductee. Within 12 hours, Amir was arrested, following which he confessed to killing Mazhar — who he claimed had stolen from him — and threw his body in a harvest field, according to the spokesperson. Police reached the site of the incident and recovered the remains of the body. “A case has been registered against the arrested suspect, who will be brought to justice and punished,” the spokesperson said. He said that Sargodha Rescue 1122 Control Room received received a call on August 31, stating that bones from dead body were found lying in a field. The police official added that Mazhar, 28, was an employee of the suspect. On the accusations of theft, Mazhar was subjected to torture and subsequently killed, after which his body was thrown into the field, for which an ambulance from the Rescue 1122 Control Room was sent to the site of the incident. On August 30, the victim’s uncle, Muhammad Aslam, registered a first information report (FIR) at the Kot Momin police station, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com. According to the FIR, Aslam met his nephew Mazhar at a fair 12 days prior to registering the case. The victim told his uncle that he hadn’t been paid his salary for several months and was being tortured by his employer, Amir, without reason. Mazhar had expressed his desire to work elsewhere, at which Amir had threatened him with “dire consequences,” according to the FIR. It further stated that following that interaction, Aslam had no contact with his nephew, and his cellphone was switched off. He went to Amir’s house and questioned the whereabouts of his nephew, to which Amir said Mazhar had left his employment without informing him and had gone elsewhere. Upon investigating, Aslam was informed by two farmhands that on August 24, at around 10am, they saw Amir and five unknown men torturing Mazhar and pushing him into a car before speeding away. "

  "description": "Two bystanders were injured on Sunday in a grenade attack on a security checkpoint in Quetta’s Chaman Phatak area, according to a senior police official. Superintendent of Police (City) Azhar Shah told Dawn.com that the injured were taken to Civil Hospital, adding that police and CTD cordoned off the area and launched an investigation. Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects threw a grenade at the checkpost, but it fell outside and exploded. SP Shah also told Dawn.com that Safe City cameras are being employed to trace the suspects. Balochistan Health Department Spokesman Dr Waseem Baig confirmed that both the victims, Osama and Ghulam Hussain, were out of danger and receiving medical aid. Last week, at least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives in different parts of Balochistan as dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — went on a rampage across the province, storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In subsequent operations, the armed forces’ media wing said 21 militants were neutralised by the security forces as Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi vowed to crush terrorism in the province. In Musakhail, a district on the border with Punjab, the militants shot dead 23 people after checking their identity documents. “We found 23 bullet-riddled bodies lying by a roadside,” Ayub Achakzai, Musakhail SSP told Dawn. He added that among the dead bodies, a person who was shot in the legs was rescued. In Kalat, militants attacked a Levies station, two hotels, and the residence of a tribal elder besides setting alight a toll plaza on the national highway. In the exchange of fire, 11 people, including four Levies officials and a police sub-inspector, lost their lives whereas nine people, including Kalat Assistant Commissioner Aftab Lasi, were injured. In Bolan’s Kolpur area, six bodies were recovered. Security officials believed they were also shot dead by militants. "

  "description": "KARACHI: A sessions court on Saturday allowed the police to grill the Karsaz accident suspect in prison in a case pertaining to alleged drug use. Natasha Danish has been arrested and sent to women prison on judicial remand for recklessly driving her SUV that ran over and killed 60-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter Amna in an accident near Karsaz on August 19. On Saturday, Sub-Inspector Shakir Rind, the investigating officer of the case, filed an application before a judicial magistrate (East) seeking permission to arrest and interrogate the suspect in a new FIR lodged under Section 11 (drinking liable to tazir) of the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979. In his order, Judicial Magistrate Javed Ali Korejo stated that medico-legal officer Dr Zainab Irshad had issued final medico-legal certificate (MLC) and opined that it had been confirmed that the suspect was under the influence of methamphetamine, commonly called ‘ice’, at the time of incident. Therefore, on the basis of such a report, a new FIR was lodged against the suspect at the Bahadurabad police station and since it was a cognizable offence, the IO was fully empowered to arrest the nominated suspect, who is already in judicial custody, after adopting all legal formalities as per law in prison, it added. “Accordingly, the Senior Superintendent of Central Women Prison is directed to facilitate the investigating officer SIP Muhammad Shakir Rind as per rules in order to arrest and interrogate the accused Ms. Natasha wife of Danish Iqbal inside the jail,” the order concluded. Earlier in the day, the police registered the new FIR. Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed on Saturday told Dawn that “chemical analysis report is positive for methamphetamine (ice).” Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2024 "

  "description": "• Ahsan, Asif oppose dialogue with PTI; Rana Sana says meeting with Achakzai had nothing to do with PTI • PML-N president favours all-embracing approach to tackle crises • PTI’s Asad Qaiser says govt ‘uncertain’ about negotiations, asks it to make contact if serious LAHORE: Amid efforts by the coalition government to woo a former key ally, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif has proposed an across-the-board dialogue involving all political parties, including the PTI, as well as the state institutions to steer Pakistan out of crises. The proposal to take everyone on board was floated amid attempts by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to court their former ally, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who had announced a solo flight against the government earlier this month. During a meeting of the party’s top brass at the Model Town headquarters on Saturday, the PML-N bigwigs discussed a host of issues, including the recent relief to power consumers, local bodies reforms in Punjab, and reorganisation of the ruling party in Punjab. Another issue that the meeting pondered upon was the strategy to deal with the rival PTI, which is facing the ire of the powers that be following the May 9 riots. A statement issued by the PML-N after the meeting quoted the elder Sharif as saying: “All political parties, governments, and institutions should join hands in decision-making. [They] …need to sit together to steer the country out of crises.” This statement came amid reports that PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah has been tasked to approach Pakht­u­nkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai — who heads the PTI-dominated opposition alliance for constitutional supremacy — for talks. Clarifying speculations on his recent meeting with Mr Achakzai, PML-N leader Sanaullah told Dawn: “I met Achakzai sahib as he is a veteran politician who stood with the PML-N leadership during testing times. I relayed to him Nawaz Sharif’s regard for him and asked him to get along with the PML-N.” He said neither Mr Achakzai nor the PML-N was under any impression that the former was mandated to speak on behalf of Imran Khan. According to Rana Sanaullah, no one from the PML-N approached the PTI for talks. “How come we seek dialogue with PTI when it categorically said it would not hold talks with us,” Mr Sanaullah questioned. Speaking about the Saturday meeting, Mr Sanaullah said: “Today, Mian sahib asked all political parties, including the PTI, and institutions, including the army and judiciary, to work jointly to address people’s issues, especially those related to the economy.” He said Nawaz Sharif’s stance had not changed from the one he spoke about at the Minar-i-Pakistan rally upon his homecoming. ‘No to talks’ Even though the PML-N president favoured talks with all parties, some senior party leaders ruled out talks with the PTI. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, the PML-N secretary general, told reporters after the Model Town meeting that there would be no talks with the PTI until it apologised for the May 9 mayhem that targeted military installations. “How come talks can be held with the party (PTI) that brought a US Congress resolution through an Indian lobby against Pakistan, and was involved in the May 9 riots,” the minister wondered. Another party leader, Khawaja Asif, said: “I am against holding any talks with the PTI.” A party insider said there were two groups in the PML-N: one favours engagement with the PTI to lower political temperature and restore political stability for the sake of the economy, while the other thinks a dialogue with the PTI will make the PML-N vulnerable as it will give political space to the PTI. ‘Uncertain mindset’ In response to a question about negotiations with the government, PTI leader Asad Qaiser questioned the sincerity of the offer, saying the government was uncertain about the dialogue and making contradictory statements. He said the statement of PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif was followed by a statement from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif that the government would not talk to the PTI. Asked if Nawaz Sharif’s statement was more important, the former National Assembly speaker said that Imran Khan had already nominated Mr Achakzai to hold negotiations with the government and that if the government was serious about the offer, it should get in touch with the PkMAP chief rather than giving suggestions. “We will respond once we get the suggestions,” he said, adding that talks can be held on an agenda-to-agenda and point-to-point basis. The PTI opposition leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, had also said that his party was ready to hold talks provided that the Shehbaz administration freed PTI prisoners, including Imran Khan. It may be noted that when PTI incarcerated founder leader Imran Khan recently spoke of conditional apology regarding the May 9 events, PMLN leaders — Maryam Nawaz, Attaullah Tarar, Azma Bokhari, Marriyum Aurangzeb, and Talal Chaudhry — rejected his offer in unison and declared that he would not be pardoned at any cost. Huddle at Model Town PML-N leaders Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif jointly chaired the party huddle in Lahore, with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and other senior leaders in attendance. The meeting was primarily a follow-up on the electricity relief measures announced by the Punjab government. Besides the power relief, it also considered suggestions to reorganise and strengthen the PML-N, especially in Punjab, which was once its stronghold. The meeting was also briefed on the performance of the party’s federal and Punjab governments of Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz. Briefing journalists, Ahsan Iqbal said: “In the meeting, Nawaz Sharif asked the federal and provincial governments to reduce their expenditure and give maximum relief to the public. “The meeting was also briefed about the new local body system, and the performance of the federal and Punjab governments.” The minister said that during the meeting, it was decided that local government polls in Punjab would be held after reforms. Responding to a question regarding Nawaz Sharif’s plan to go to London for treatment in September, Mr Iqbal said it was not final yet. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the meeting about his contacts with the political leadership of other parties. Recently, the PM called on JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, urging him not to participate in any agitation against the government.

  "description": "KARACHI: Six hundred and sixty-four Pakistani pilgrims, who were stranded for many hours in Iraq due to flight issues, returned on Saturday, according to a spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Media footage showed pilgrims arriving at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport. CAA spokesperson Saifullah told Dawn.com that an Iraqi Airways flight arrived with 358 pilgrims on early Saturday morning. Later, another flight from Iraq, which was supposed to land at Karachi at 2:20pm, landed at 5:20pm with 306 passengers on board, the CAA spokesperson added. Thus, a total of 664 pilgrims arrived on the two flights.  FO blames ‘technical fault’ with two aircraft for the delay  The travellers had visited Iraq for Arbaeen — the Chehlum commemoration marking the 40th day of mourning for Imam Hussain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). More than 21 million devotees from across the world took part in the Arbaeen pilgrimage this year, which reached its peak on Sunday, with attendees displaying their support for Gaza. Earlier, in a press release issued late on Friday night, the FO said Pakistani pilgrims were stranded at the Baghdad airport “because of technical fault with two aircraft of Iraq Airways”. “The return of these zaireen (pilgrims) is expected to start tonight,” the FO said, adding that it expected all stranded passengers to return by Aug 31. The affected travellers said they were not being informed about when or how they would be able to travel. “We have been sitting hungry and thirsty at the airport, and no one is addressing our concerns,” one pilgrim said. The FO claimed that the foreign and aviation ministries and Pakistan’s embassy in Iraq were in contact with Iraqi authorities and Iraq Airways for early repatriation of the stranded Pakistanis. Later, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar directed Pakistan’s Ambassador in Baghdad Hamid Abbas Lafta to “look after the stranded Pakistanis and to facilitate their early return”, the FO statement claimed. It added that the embassy provided meals and “facilitated their temporary stay” in Baghdad. Buses carrying Pakistani pilgrims have seen multiple accidents in Iran and Pakistan in the past weeks, resulting in at least 42 deaths. At least three were killed and 48 injured in a bus-truck collision near Iran’s Neyriz city on Sunday night, days after another crash in Yazd city killed 28 people and wounded 23. A bus accident on Pakistan’s Makran coastal highway on Sunday had also claimed the lives of at least 11 people and injured 35. Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: The syndicate of the University of Karachi on Saturday cancelled the degree and enrolment of a candidate, said to be a high court judge, on the recommendation of its Unfair Means (UFM) Committee, varsity officials said. The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. Dr Riaz, an associate professor at the university’s department of applied chemistry, was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree. Talking to rights activists and some members of the media after being released, Dr Riaz in a video statement claimed that the degree issue involved Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri of the Islamabad High Court.  Syndicate member claims police detained him to stop him from attending the ‘crucial’ meeting  However, it could not be verified independently as neither KU Vice Chancellor Dr Khalid Iraqi nor any other official of the university were immediately available for comment. As the syndicate meeting was scheduled for Saturday afternoon, Dr Riaz claimed he had already objected to an agenda item pertaining to the case involving the judge’s law degree after 40 years. Dr Riaz claimed that he was picked up from Tipu Sultan Road at around 1pm when he was on his way to KU to attend the meeting. Later, the syndicate meeting was held without Dr Riaz and among other decisions it gave consent to the cancellation of the degree. According to a KU press release, “The members also approved the recommendations of the KU UFM [unfair means] Committee which has proposed cancellation of the degree and enrolment cards of the candidate(s) who were found in unethical and immoral acts.” The press release did not name any candidate. Over two months ago, a letter began circulating on social media, purportedly from the KU’s controller of examinations, regarding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree. The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking in-formation under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name of Tariq Jahangiri. Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme. Justice Jahangiri is among the six judges who previously complained to the Supreme Judicial Council about chief justice and accused the Inter-Services Intelligence of interfering in judicial affairs. The complaint included allegations of spy cameras being detected at the entrance and in the bedroom of a judge, a matter that was reportedly conveyed to the chief justice but to no avail. Earlier, Dr Riaz while talking to his colleagues claimed that he was taken away from Tipu Sultan Road when he left his residence to go to the KU at 1pm. He was initially taken to the Jamshed Quarters police station from where he was brought to the Bahadurabad police station where his wife, Sophia, arrived at 6pm and met him. He claimed police told her that they were releasing him, but again took him to the Brigade police station. The KU teacher was released after eight hours of ‘illegal’ detention.

  "description": "LAHORE: Embattling scathing criticism for not being able to hold the much-hyped mass political public gathering, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has shifted its Lahore public meeting from Sept 15 to 22. PTI Punjab general secretary Ham­mad Azhar on Saturday announced that the party had submitted an application afresh for a public meeting at Minar-i-Pakistan ground (Iqbal Park) for Sept 22. PTI secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan wrote a three-page application to the Lahore deputy commissioner seeking an NOC to hold a ‘mass political gathering’ at the Minar-i-Pakistan ground (Iqbal Park) on Sept 15. Since the PTI had abruptly cancelled its Aug 22 “Islamabad Jalsa” amid varying views of the party leaders on the postponement, the party has been facing strong criticism for not being able to mobilise enough public for its public meetings. Stating that a fresh application has been filed for Sept 22 public meeting in Lahore, Hammad Azhar tweeted the party would focus more on Sept 8 Islamabad jalsa. He stated the party would organise a major “religious event” on 12th Rabiul Awal. On the other hand, leaders of the ruling PML-N criticised the PTI leadership for not being able to organise a public meeting for a second consecutive time. Some of their senior leaders had publicly said the PTI might have to complete its hat-trick by postponing the upcoming Sept 8 Islamabad jalsa. Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2024 "

  "description": "   GWADAR: Fishing boats being shifted to safe place due to the expected cyclone in the Arabian Sea, on Saturday.—Behram Baloch  • Heavy rains wreak havoc in Balochistan; hundreds of families rendered homeless • Quetta-Chaman highway washed away at multiple points KARACHI / QUETTA: Altho­ugh Sindh has largely moved out of Cyclone Asna’s influence, Baloch­is­tan may still experience thundershowers with heavy downpours along its coastal areas until Sun­day night, according to a senior official at the Pakistan Met­eorological Department (PMD). “The cyclone is moving away from both Sindh and Balochistan, though the latter’s coastal parts are likely to experience rain-thundershowers with a few heavy falls till Asna dissipates at sea tomorrow night (Sunday) before reaching Oman,” Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz told Dawn. It’s the same system that brought about heavy downpour in Balochistan from Aug 26 onwards and later turned into a cyclone. “At that time, it prevailed over east Rajasthan, India, in the form of a low pressure area, sending strong monsoon currents over Balochistan where the conditions became critical due to flash floods and poor infrastructure,” Mr Sarfaraz said. Regarding media reports of another low-pressure developing over the Bay of Bengal, he said a weather system goes through multiple stages of intensity before becoming a cyclone, and it’s too early to comment on this specific system at present. According to a PMD advisory released on Saturday night, cyclonic storm Asna over central Arabian Sea continued to move further westward and lies at a distance of about 370km southwest of Karachi, 250km southwest of Ormara and 260km south-southeast of Gwadar. The system is likely to track further westwards till Sunday, then turn southwestward and weaken gradually. “Under its influence, rain-thundershowers with a few heavy falls and accompanied with squally winds (60-70Km/hour) are likely in Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Ormara, Pasni, Gwadar, Jiwani, Turbat, Panjgur, and surrounding areas till Sunday night. “Heavy rains may create water logging in low-lying areas of Makran coast. Sea conditions are likely to remain rough/very rough with squally winds of 60-70km/hour gusting 80km/hour till Sept 1. “Fishermen of Balochistan are advised not to venture in open sea till the night of Sept 1 while those of Sindh can resume activities from tomorrow,” the PMD advisory said. Massive destruction Heavy monsoon rains and flash floods continued to wreak havoc in Balochistan on Saturday, causing massive destruction of road infrastructure, leaving hundreds of families homeless as numerous mud houses collapsed in various areas of the province. The Afghan transit trade was suspended after the Quetta-Chaman highway was washed away at multiple points. Officials said the mountainous area of Khojak Pass, connecting Quetta with Chaman and Kandahar, received the heaviest rainfall, causing severe damage to the historical Shella Bagh tunnel. The tunnel was filled with mud after a mudslide in the area, rendering it impassable. Consequently, the train service between Quetta and Chaman has been suspended, as the 4.5km long railway tunnel is buried under approximately five feet of mud. “Train services cannot be restored immediately,” officials told Dawn, adding that cleaning the mud from the tunnel will be a time-consuming process. The Shella Bagh railway station was also badly affected by the flash flood. According to reports, heavy rain began in the Khojak mountains last night and continued until Saturday morning, causing parts of N-25 to be washed away, suspending traffic between Quetta and Chaman and disrupting Afghan transit trade via the highway and rail. A large number of trucks carrying transit goods and other items bound for Chaman and Kandahar were stranded between Qila Abdullah and Chaman. In light of the flood situation and destruction, the district administration has declared a flood emergency across the entire Chaman district. The flash flood also badly hit many areas of Qila Abdullah, where a lar­ge number of mud houses were swept away, leaving people homeless. Ac­­co­rding to officials, a village in the Qila Saifullah area was completely des­troyed, and dozens of families were displaced after their houses were wa­­shed away in the heavy floodwaters, which resulted from several hours of continuous heavy rainfall. The Qila Saifullah deputy commissioner said the families had been shifted to safe places as Levies and local administration started rescue operation soon after receiving information about the destruction. According to reports, Jhal Magsi in Nasirabad division was severely affected, with vast areas submerged in floodwater and many villages cut off from the district headquarters. Hundreds of families were maroo­ned as the River Mola was overflowing with floodwaters, fuelled by heavy rains in the catchment area of the river in Khuzdar. “Given the dire situation, the PDMA has dispatched boats to rescue people stranded in various villages,” said Aurangzeb Khan, head of PDMA Balochistan, adding that they are also sending tents and other rel­ief goods to Jhal Magsi to evacuate families trapped in the floodwater. According to officials, 13 people were swept away in flash floods that hit Loralai, Qila Saifullah, Duki, Harnai, and Jhal Magsi areas of Balochistan. In Loralai, seven family members were trapped in floodwater, but rescue workers and Levies personnel rescued them after a five-hour effort. PDMA officials said Bolan, Nari Gaj, Lehri, and Mola rivers, as well as other seasonal streams, were carrying heavy floodwater. According to irrigation officials, 84,000 cusecs of floodwater was passing through the Nari Gaj River in the Sibi area, while 11,000 cusecs were recorded in the Bolan River at Pingra Bridge. “All rivers and seasonal streams are in high flood,” a senior irrigation department official told Dawn, adding that the Mushkaf and Sani rivers were also carrying 6,000 cusecs of floodwater each.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Police have picked up former Jamaat-i-Islami senator, Mushtaq Ahmed, his wife and son along with over two dozen protestors, during a march organised to express solidarity with the people of Gaza. The ex-senator earlier called for the rally and asked the people to gather at Express Chowk, one of the entry points of the Red Zone from D-Chowk side. The Islamabad administration had imposed Section 144 of the criminal procedure code, banning all type of gatherings. The authorities also warned that violators would face legal action. The capital police said the violators of the ban were picked up from different localities, including Express Chowk, China Chowk, Embassy Road and Sarena Chowk. They were later shifted to different police installations, including Secretariat, Kohsar and Shalimar police stations, officials said.  Gatherings in federal capital banned  Officials said the capital police also closed a portion of Jinnah Avenue and made diversion from China Chowk and Kulsoom Plaza Chowk. A contingent of police, including anti-riot units and policewomen, were also deployed at Express Chowk. Besides, prison vans were also brought there to pick up and shift the protestors to police installations. A warning was issued from police that no one would be allowed to stage protest there, officials said. In response of the protest call, people in small groups attempted to reach Express Chowk, they said, adding that some of them were arrested. Police said the protesters on Jinnah Avenue were asked to move towards the National Press Club instead of Express Chowk. But they, too, were later picked up. Police said that those picked up were detained at different installations. However, no decision had been made if they were to be put behind bars after the registration of a case against them or they were to be set free. Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2024 "

  "description": "Dr Riaz Ahmed, an associate professor and syndicate member at the University of Karachi (KU), was released on Saturday night after eight hours of alleged “illegal detention” by three police stations in Karachi upon protest and outcry.      Fellow colleague Prof Tauseef Ahmed told Dawn.com that Dr Ahmed left his home earlier today to go to KU but he did not reach the university and his whereabouts were unknown. He said the KU professor was a member of its syndicate whose meeting was scheduled for Saturday to “decide about the degree issue of a judge of Islamabad High Court (IHC)”. He added that Riaz had earlier posted on X where he alleged “external pressure” on the KU syndicate regarding the degree case.         Tauseef alleged that Dr Riaz’s “disappearance” could be related to the KU’s syndicate meeting. He said that rights activists had reached Bahadurabad police station, claiming that Riaz was taken away from there in two police mobiles. Bahadurabad Station House Officer Naeem Rajput denied the detention of the political activist. Dawn.com also reached out to East Senior Superintendent of Police Dr Farrukh Raza for a response but did not receive any. Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Vice Chairperson Qazi Khizar told Dawn.com that Dr Riaz was brought to the Bahadurabad police station where he was released after the protest and pressure by rights activists, KU teachers and students, lawyers and labour leaders and intervention of higher police authorities. Khizar said that Dr Riaz told them that he was taken away from Tipu Sultan Road when he left his residence to go to KU at 1pm. “He was detained for eight hours,” Khizar said. Dr Riaz said in his recorded video at the police station that he was supposed to attend the KU syndicate meeting about the degree issue of the IHC judge when he was taken away.         He reiterated the same in a media talk after his release, saying he was due to attend the syndicate meeting to discuss the issue of the IHC judge’s degree. He alleged various procedural anomalies in how the issue was being conducted.         His wife, also in a recorded video from the police station, said that when she came to know from the university at 5pm that her husband had not attended the meeting, she came to the Bahadurabad police station where her husband was present who narrated the whole story to her but later on, he was taken away in police mobiles to an unknown location.         The HRCP condemned the disappearance of the KU professor.         Meanwhile, KU Teachers Society secretary Dr Asad Tanoli announced a boycott of all classes at the university on Monday. The KU teachers’ body in a statement also expressed concerns over the “mysterious disappearance” of Dr Riaz. He had also gone missing in 2018, but returned home a day later. He was taken into custody by Rangers in April 2017 for allegedly carrying an unlicensed pistol when he was on his way to the Karachi Press Club (KPC) to hold a press conference to demand the release of over 70-year-old retired professor and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London leader Dr Hasan Zafar Arif. He was picked up minutes before he was to hold a press conference at the KPC to demand proper treatment for the late Dr Arif. Dr Riaz was subsequently released on bail. The associate professor was also the core organiser of a seminar on Balochistan’s missing persons held at KU in 2015 after a similar session was cancelled by the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

  "description": "Karachi police on Friday filed a fresh case under the Hudood law against Natasha Danish — the driver booked in last week’s deadly Karsaz traffic accident that killed two and injured three people — days after police said that her medical report showed she was under the influence of methamphetamine (crystal meth). On August 19, a speeding Toyota Land Cruiser, driven by Danish, hit three motorcycles and another car before overturning on the city’s Karsaz Road. Sixty-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter Amna were killed in the accident, while three others were wounded. The driver was arrested and booked for manslaughter charges. In a court hearing on Aug 21, a counsel of the victim had called for a probe into the “kind of drug” that the suspect was allegedly under the influence of at the time of the accident. Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday said Danish’s medical report showed she was under the influence of crystal meth, although the report was not made public at the time. Bahadurabad police Station House Officer Mohammed Naeem Rajput told Dawn.com today that a separate first information report (FIR) was registered against Danish under Section 11 (drinking liable to tazir) of the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order (PEHO) of 1979. Section 11 of the Hudood Order says those found guilty of drinking but not found liable for hadd punishment (those ordained by the Holy Quran or Sunnah) will instead be liable for tazir (any punishment other than hadd) and punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with whipping not exceeding thirty stripes or with both. Rajput said the law was invoked after medical reports confirmed that Danish was under the influence of the drug. Meanwhile, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to Dawn.com today that Danish’s “chemical analysis report is positive for methamphetamine in the urine sample”. Thus, she said, it was “confirmed that she (Danish) had methamphetamine in her system at the time [of the accident]”. The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed at the Bahadurabad police station at the complaint of Sub-Inspector Rehan Ahmed. The FIR said the Bahadurabad police had carried out a medical examination of the driver at the time of the accident and sealed samples of her urine and blood were sent to the chemical examiner’s office for an examination, with the subsequent report submitted to the police surgeon’s office. It added that the police surgeon, in her final report dated August 29, said the suspect was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the accident around 6:30pm on Aug 19. Therefore, the FIR said that after receiving the police surgeon’s final report, the senior police officers sent a letter for legal opinion and now the new case was filed under the Hudood law after receiving directions from the office of the deputy superintendent of police (legal) via the office of the East senior superintendent of police (investigation) dated Aug 30. Meanwhile, the victims’ counsel Jibran Nasir said that crystal meth was a scheduled prohibited drug under the Control of Narcotics Substances Act 1997 and the consumption of a scheduled prohibited drug became an offence under the Control of Narcotics Substances Amendment Act 2022. He further said that driving under the influence of a drug was a crime under Section 100 of the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1965. Nasir said he was unable to understand why the PEHO law was invoked since the scheduled drugs under the aforementioned law did not contain crystal meth and nor was there any notification or amendment that added the narcotic to the schedule. He claimed that an offence could only be made out under the Hudood law if the drugs included in its scheduled list were consumed. "

  "content": "  ISLAMABAD: Expressing satisfaction over the \"nosediving of inflation rate\" in the country, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that the economy is moving towards stability owing to the hard work of the government’s financial team.  Citing the details shared by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the prime minister said on Sunday that the ‘Consumer Price Index’ fell to record low in July 2024, bringing inflation to 11% and welcomed the forecast of further decline in the inflation rate in the current month of September.  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance — in its monthly outlook report — stated that on account of stability in economic indicators, inflation is expected to remain within the range of 9.5-10.5% in August and further decline to 9-10% in September.  “After Fitch, the global rating agency, Moody’s recently upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating, which is an acknowledgement of the country’s positive economic indicators by the international financial institutions,” the PM Office Media Wing, in an official statement, quoted the premier as saying.  The government is pursuing a policy of economic reforms and the implementation work is rapidly in progress over the rightsizing policy of the government which the premier himself is monitoring, according to the communique. PM Shehbaz also expressed the confidence that its positive impact on the economy would be visible soon.  At the same time he also acknowledged that the federal and Punjab governments had provided a big relief to the electricity consumers in respect of monthly bills, adding the prices of petroleum products were further reduced from today.  The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government announced a reduction of Rs14 per unit in the electricity tariff for August and September under a power subsidy plan for consumers using 201 to 500 units. The premier said that the government believed in passing on all the benefits of such policies to the common man. “The government is cognizant of the issues of the people and was striving day and night to resolve them,” he added.  Earlier in August, Moody's Ratings upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 owing to improvement in macroeconomic conditions. “We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured MTN programme to (P)Caa2 from (P)Caa3. Concurrently, the outlook for the Government of Pakistan has changed to positive from stable,” the rating agency said in a statement.  Accordingly, Pakistan's default risk has reduced to a level consistent with a Caa2 rating, as per Moody’s. “There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of $7 billion.”  The release of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest schedule is a significant development, but the absence of Pakistan's loan approval on the agenda is a cause of concern as it is critical for the country to secure the loan to shore up its sinking economy. On the other hand, the government remained optimistic that the country will secure approval for a $7 billion bailout package from the IMF next month, sources privy to the matters told Geo News earlier this week. Finance Minister Aurangzeb last week also dismissed concerns about the IMF declining the staff-level agreement, exuding confidence that \"the lender will approve it next month\". Pakistan and the global lender had reached an agreement on the 37-month loan programme in July. The IMF said the programme was subject to approval from its Executive Board and obtaining \"timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners\"."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A day after the the resignation of country’s leading economist, Dr Kaiser Bengali, from official committees over “biased” rightsizing, the government on Sunday said the former’s decision apparently stemmed from a communication gap or misunderstanding.  “Not only positions from grades 1 to 16 but all government positions from grades 1 to 22 are being right-sized,” a government spokesperson told Geo News on Sunday. He said that scores of high-ranking officials would also be put on the chopping block. “The rightsizing committee has reviewed six ministries so far, in the first phase. Dissolution of one ministry has been approved, while two others will be merged.” In this context, at least two officers of BPS-22 and several others from BPS-17 to BPS-21 may be terminated as their positions would become redundant, the spokesperson said, describing the economist’s claim as a misunderstanding. The official remarked that approximately 60,000 positions could become surplus, including posts from grades 17 to 22. Bengali on Saturday stepped down from three government committees formed to cut expenditures and carry out institutional rightsizing, warning that the economy “is on a ventilator due to [mounting] debts and on the path to destruction”. He accused the government of targeting employees in grades 1 to 16 while sparing officials of higher grades in its rightsizing drive. “The rightsizing committee respects Bengali’s opinion, however, it appears to be based on a lack of information.” The official asserted that in this regard the committee was comprehensively and impartially reviewing the autonomous and government organisations.  Meanwhile, he said, the federal cabinet was highlighting various aspects of the recommendations approved by the rightsizing committee. The spokesperson said the government was working on a compulsory retirement package with necessary amendments to the Civil Servants Act, of 1973, as well. “This package can be applied to all civil servants without any favour or preference,” the spox said. Bengali has sent his resignation to Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb and Cabinet Division Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. He was a member of key bodies for austerity, rightsizing and expenditure reduction committees formed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition government to deal with the economic crisis after it returned to power after the 2024 general elections. His resignation comes at a time when the government is claiming to make all-out efforts to come out of the economic crisis via austerity measures, rightsizing and privatisation of unnecessary and loss-making state-owned entities, as well as seeking another bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In his statement, Bengali praised the incumbents for initiating \"good efforts\" to reduce its spending and termed the three committees crucial for cutting down the government's expenditure. Detailing his services, the economist said that all three committees tabled recommendations to the federal government for reducing the government's expenses. He added that the panels suggested shutting down 17 divisions and 50 departments after precisely reviewing the functioning and effectiveness of 70 government institutions and 17 corporations. “This government is taking steps against the recommendations [of the committees],” Bengali said slamming the decisions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration. “Junior employees — from Grade 1 to 16 — are being terminated instead of high-ranking officers from Grade 17 to 22 to reduce the expenses,” he alleged. “Jobs of Grades 17 to 22 officers in different departments are being protected [by the federal government]. If we remove these high-ranking officers, we could have cut our financial expenses by Rs30 billion annually,” he claimed. His statement cast doubt on the recent government moves to rightsize federal ministries and institutions, including restructuring of the state-owned utility stores, closure of the Public Works Department (PWD), and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). It is also worth mentioning here that the federal cabinet was also informed earlier this week regarding the merger of 82 government bodies related to different ministries and their dissolution into 40 institutions in light of the rightsizing committee’s recommendations. Bengali, who has a master’s degree in economics from Boston University, USA, and a PhD degree in economics from the University of Karachi, warned that the economy is “on the path to destruction” due to the piling up of debts. The people are compelled to commit suicide as it’s become difficult for the masses to manage household budgets, the economist added. Throwing shade at the PML-N government’s economic policies, he claimed that global institutions, including the IMF, have refused to disburse loans to Pakistan."

  "content": "LONDON: As incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder seeks nomination for the ceremonial post of Oxford University's chancellor, The Guardian newspaper — one of UK's most respected newspapers — strongly opposed the potential candidacy and called him “Taliban-friendly” and “supporter” for former Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.  Khan had said from jail that he has submitted his nomination to run for Oxford’s new chancellor because the university helped him in his early years and he wanted to \"give back\" and that \"I am committed to giving back to the world the resilience, determination and integrity that life has taught me, even when the odds are stacked against me\".  The move drew backlash with the varsity sources confirming that its office has received several emails raising concerns about his support for the Taliban in the past and corruption cases.  In an article published on Sunday, the regular columnist Catherine Bennett wrote that the deposed prime minister had once called Osama bin Laden a “martyr” and refused to call him a terrorist. She asked what kind of impact a person like the PTI founder would create on a UK academic career for saying that the Taliban were “breaking the shackles of slavery” when they deposed the Afghan government and took over Kabul, including providing excuses for the Taliban’s ban on women's education.  The Guardian article also questioned Khan’s stated belief on rape, where he said that women should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower”. “Opinions like these, though widely shared, have probably deprived Oxford’s contest of countless male applicants,” it stated, likening Khan to social media influencer and sportsman, Andrew Tate. “Fans ambitious for Khan’s popular fellow sportsman, Tate, must be kicking themselves for worrying about, for example, his ‘if you put yourself in a position to be raped, you must bare [sic] some responsibility’.” She questioned the Conservative peer, Lord Hannan, for calling Imran Khan “a towering figure”. “He would make a superb chancellor for the world’s foremost university,” Hannan said. According to Bennett, if the election of Oxford chancellor can appear, including from within the potential voting pool, roughly as significant as crown choices at the state opening of parliament, unprecedented campaigning for a Taliban-friendly candidate suggests, however, that if the prize is worth exploiting, it must also be worth defending. She wrote: “The appointment is for a decade. Khan is months into his latest, 14-year sentence (seemingly imposed, his allies say, for political reasons) and the Oxford job involves, along with administrative duties, presiding over several key ceremonies. Not onerous, but involving ceremonial robes, performance and speeches. The chancellor must be readily accessible and available throughout the year.”  The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than a year after he was booked in a plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case. Despite securing relief in several cases, the PTI founder remains behind bars after he was booked in a new Toshakhana case and other cases related to the May 9 mayhem. Meanwhile, Catherine vied for a candidate named Lady Elish Angiolini – who according to the columnist is “apolitical and respected”.  “She was the first in her family to go to university, became Scotland’s first female procurator fiscal and its first female lord advocate, subsequently principal of St Hugh’s College, then a pro-vice-chancellor of Oxford. Having headed official reviews on policing, rape and deaths in custody, she now chairs the Angiolini inquiry into the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard,” she wrote.  Last week, Britain’s prestigious University of Oxford received several emails and a petition raising concerns about the university’s decision to allow former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently languishing in Adiala jail, to apply for the ceremonial post of Oxford’s chancellor.  The plea stated: “Khan has frequently expressed views and taken actions that align with extremist elements, particularly the Taliban. He has proposed allowing the Taliban to open an office in Pakistan, which sparked widespread criticism both within the country and internationally. This suggestion was particularly alarming given the Taliban’s history of violence and human rights abuses.”  “He has referred to the Taliban as freedom fighters’, especially during the US presence in Afghanistan. After the US withdrawal, Imran celebrated the event as the Afghans ‘breaking the shackles of slavery’, a statement widely interpreted as support for the Taliban’s return to power.” The PTI founder has confirmed he has applied to be in the running as the next chancellor of University of Oxford for a 10-year term. Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Keble College.  He has previously served as chancellor of the University of Bradford from 2005 until 2014, and is vying to replace conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who announced in February his resignation as Oxford’s chancellor."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government's investigation team summoned 13 independent power producers (IPPs) owners to Islamabad after it discovered \"additional profiteering\" by power plants established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), sources told Geo News on Sunday. The sources added that with Special Assistant to PM (SAPM) on Power Division Muhammad Ali playing a key role in the probe, the IPP owners have been directed to bring financial reports tomorrow. The development comes after the Senate's Functional Committee on Devolution, last month, directed the related ministry to conduct a forensic audit of the IPPs with chair Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur expressing concerns about the functioning of the IPPs and the lack of transparency in contracts with them. The IPPs have been in the light for some time now over their alleged involvement in exorbitant electricity bills that have drawn a strong reaction from the inflation-weary masses. There have been calls to review the government's existing agreements with the IPP — the most notable one coming from Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) which staged a 14-day sit-in in Rawalpindi and demanded the renegotiation of contracts with the IPPs among other things. The government has admitted that the country has the highest electricity tariffs in the region with Energy Minister Awais Leghari saying that the nation would receive \"good news\" regarding the IPPs soon. However, it is unlikely that there might be any unilateral change in IPPs contracts as Leghari, earlier this week, said that the government could not unilaterally terminate agreements and warned that such a move will lead the country to face a \"Reko Diq-like situation\". Responding to questions at the Senate's Standing Committee on Power, the minister — who also chairs a task force reviewing the IPP issue — argued against unilaterally ending these power purchase agreements with the IPPs blamed for massive power tariffs, saying that the contracts have a sovereign guarantee cover. Providing details on the ongoing probe involving the IPP issue, sources said that influential members of the investigation team have visited various plants to collect records and data. With senior executives set to converge in the federal capital following interrogation in various cities, the government aims to woo IPP owners underscoring the country's need for their support. Furthermore, it has been decided to reduce the capacity payment and profit of government-owned power plants. Also, the government is set to hold high-level talks with Chinese IPPs to seek concessions. It is to be noted that in July, Islamabad initiated talks on re-profiling its power sector debt to China, alongside talks on structural reforms suggested by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Power Division, however, has refuted the reports regarding the summoning of IPP owners saying that no IPP owner was directed to appear before the investigation committee. The sources have stressed that no unilateral action was being taken regarding IPPs contracts and that achieving a consensus is not possible without hearing IPPs. They also added that talks with the IPPs have been going on for days with the Leghari-headed task force at the helm of it."

  "content": "If you are planning to hit roads in Pakistan with a UK driving licence, think twice before turning the ignition. A foreign licence might not be your golden ticket to drive without an International Driving Permit (IDP). Imagine arriving in Pakistan, ready to navigate the bustling streets, only to find out that your UK driving licence alone won’t cut it. The rules here are clear: if you want to drive legally, you will need an IDP alongside your valid licence. This isn’t just a formality; it is a legal necessity. Geo Digital spoke to Sindh DIG Licensing and Traffic Iqbal Dara, who shed light on this issue: \"We provide legal protection to foreign nationals driving in Pakistan under the Vienna Convention of 1968. This convention, signed in Paris, allows citizens of signatory countries to drive legally in other member states. Pakistan is a signatory to this agreement.\"  He further clarified that UK citizens with a valid IDP can indeed drive in Pakistan, but only if it is accompanied by their driving licence. This legal requirement was spotlighted recently in a high-profile case involving a traffic incident on Karachi’s Karsaz Road. The accused, who held a UK driving licence, had her lawyer argue that the licence was valid worldwide. However, as Dara points out, without the IDP, even the most prestigious foreign licences cannot shield you from legal consequences in Pakistan. In Sindh, obtaining an IDP is straightforward and affordable, with a fee of just Rs1,100. Yet, Dara adds a surprising trend: many Pakistanis are quick to secure an IDP out of fear of foreign laws if they are planning to move abroad but often overlook getting a driving licence in their own country. This lack of awareness can have serious repercussions. The traffic police personnel also warns that driving without a licence in Pakistan could lead to severe legal consequences, including charges as grave as murder in the event of an accident. So, what exactly is an IDP, and how does it work? An IDP is essentially your passport to driving abroad, complementing your domestic driving licence. It’s not a replacement but a necessary companion that ensures you’re legally recognised to drive in other countries. The history of the IDP dates back to the 1926 Motor Traffic Convention in Paris, with further developments under the 1949 Geneva Convention and the 1968 Vienna Convention. These agreements have shaped the current system, where many countries, including Pakistan, accept IDPs issued under these conventions. If you hold a UK driving licence and plan to drive in Pakistan, be sure to have the 1968 IDP in hand. The UK government’s official website confirms that this is the recognised permit for driving in Pakistan, underscoring the need to be fully prepared before you take the wheel in a foreign land."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to iconic Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani for his lifelong struggle for the rights of the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on his third death anniversary on Sunday. The Kashmiri leader, whose famous saying “We are Kashmiris and Pakistan is our country” has inspired millions, died after a long-drawn-out house arrest at his Srinagar residence on September 1, 2021. In his message, the president said Geelani was a beacon of hope and resistance, inspiring countless Kashmiris to stand firm in their quest for self-determination. \"His tireless efforts and sacrifices for the just cause of the Kashmiri people will forever be etched in our hearts and minds,” he said, adding that he was a great leader and his commitment to the right to self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir was unyielding. Despite being subjected to house arrests and incarcerations by the Indian occupational forces, President Zardari said that he continued to raise his voice for the people of IIOJK. \"His personal hardships, including years of confinement, could not break his spirit or deter him from his mission.\" He added: “Geelani sahib remained focused on the ultimate goal, and never allowed the attention of the Kashmiri people to be diverted from the pursuit of their fundamental right to self-determination. \"His leadership and unwavering stance against oppression have left a lasting impression on the people of IIOJK. “Today, we reaffirm the resolve not to let the sacrifices of Syed Ali Shah Geelani and countless others go in vain. We will continue to advocate for the realisation of the people of IIOJK’s right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. “I assure my Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan will continue to provide moral, diplomatic, and political support for their just cause,” the president maintained. He said as we remember Geelani, we must learn from his exemplary courage and unwavering commitment to freedom and justice. “May Allah Almighty shower His blessings on Syed Ali Shah Geelani. A’ameen,” he said. On the other hand, paying tribute to the late Kashmiri leader, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s continuing moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiri people of the IIOJK. Remembering Geelani, the premier said that his name would always be remembered and respected in the movement for the freedom of IIOJK. “Geelani had been a great Kashmiri leader who had a firm faith in the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination. Late Geelani had devoted his entire life to the achievement of the same objective,” the PM Office media wing, in an official statement, quoted the prime minister as saying. Premier Shehbaz further said that Geelani’s contributions to the freedom of the Kashmiri people and the struggle for the right to self-determination would always be remembered, adding suffering experienced during imprisonment could not deter Geelani’s strong resolve. “His sacrifices would not go in vain,” the prime minister said, adding that the struggle for the right to self-determination would continue."

ReutersGohar rejects reports of PTI seeking talks with govt.He says PTI has no wish of holding talks with ruling party.PTI chief says matters related to NA discussed...",
  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Rebuking reports suggesting an indirect dialogue with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan has said that his party hasn't offered any talks to the incumbent ruling party. \"The PTI neither offered to engage in talks [with the ruling party] nor sought any favours [from them],\" Barrister Gohar said while speaking to Geo News on Sunday.  The PTI chairman added that only matters pertaining to the National Assembly were discussed during their meeting with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.   The PTI chief's remarks come in the wake of reports backing the prospects of dialogue between the Imran Khan-founded party and its archrival the PML-N. In contrast to the PTI chairman's rebuttal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman and the PTI-led opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Aiyeen-e-Pakistan chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai confirmed the offer of negotiations by the PML-N, The News reported on Sunday. \"All the political leadership, including Nawaz Sharif, is on the same page with regard to the Constitution, I have met Rana Sanaullah. There is no other way to take the country forward except through negotiations,\" Achakzai said during an informal conversation with journalists in Islamabad. Recalling that the PTI had picked him to lead the negotiations, Achakzai remarked that the former ruling party should have given a positive response to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer of talks and that apart from Khan, the party leadership's opposition to dialogue did not matter. Despite the veteran politician's confirmation, ambiguity surrounds the prospects of PTI-PML-N talks as incarcerated Khan has time again ruled out negotiations with the Nawaz Sharif-led party, saying that he would hold only talk with those who wield real power in the country. \"Achakzai will only [hold] talk with political parties,\" Khan said last month while stressing that he was open to talks but only within the \"ambit provisioned by the Constitution\". A day earlier, two senior PML-N leaders — Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — expressed their opposition to the prospects of talks with the PTI wherein the former conditioned it with the issuance of an apology by Khan's party for allegedly staging last year's May 9 violent protests.  Meanwhile, Asif, while highlighting that he wasn't part of the team assigned to talk to the PkMAP chairman, said that he was not in favour of any such dialogue with the former ruling party. Elaborating on his meeting with the NA speaker, Barrister Gohar clarified that there was no discussion on dialogue. \"No PTI member parliament is in contact with the PML-N leadership over talks [...] neither the PTI's parliamentary leadership hasn't held any negotiations with the PML-N and nor do [we] have such wish,\" the PTI chairman said. Separately however, the publication has reported the PTI chief saying: \"We have not been told by anyone but the formation of a government committee for negotiations is a good thing.\""

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) minister for communication and works Shakeel Ahmad Khan has called for a judicial inquiry to probe the corruption allegations levelled against him. \"A judicial inquiry should be conducted into the allegations of corruption against me [...] I'm [even] ready for an investigation by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB),\" Shakeel said while speaking to Geo News. The ex-minister's statement follows his resignation last month over alleged corruption and bad governance by the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province.   \"That the provincial government has compromised on its basic principles and commitments we made with the public at large at the election campaign [....] Bad governance and corruption at all levels of the provincial government has destroyed the image of the party programme and manifesto in the ranks and files of party workers,\" Shakeel wrote in his resignation letter. However, the provincial government, while dismissing the allegations, had de-notified him saying that the former minister was sacked on corruption charges, The News had reported. Shakeel's resignation has seemingly created a rift in the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership with Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar putting their weight behind Shakeel — a move which apparently didn't sit well with Gandapur's administration which de-notified Akbar after his overt support for the former minister. Referring to the three-member committee formed by the party to monitor corruption and governance in the KP, Shakeel said: \"It is a bad government committee.\" Noting that the former president Arif Alvi has assured him of arranging a meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan, Shakeel said that he would communicate everything to the incarcerated former prime minister upon meeting him. He also said that he would only remain silent till the party's September 8 rally and would present his point of view to the public after the public gathering. The remarks refer to the PTI's public rally in Islamabad which was rescheduled to September 8 after being called off by the party leadership following the administration's refusal to grant necessary permission."

  "content": "KARACHI: The effects of cyclonic storm are almost over as \"Asna\" has moved far away from Karachi’s coastline, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Sunday. However, the Met Office said, light rain or drizzling was expected to hit Karachi because of prevailing overcast. Not just the system of rain but strong and gusty winds had also died down as winds in the morning blew from the north-east at 12 kilometres speed, it said. The weather department said the cyclonic storm had moved past Karachi as far as 500 kilometres in the south-east and 350km from Ormara in the south and south-east. Whereas, it has moved 260km in south-east of Gwadar, it added.  The department gave permission to the Sindh fishermen to resume their activities in the sea from today and warned Balochistan fishermen not to go into deep sea for another day.  “About 60-70km wind may blow in the cyclone Asna, in the meanwhile,” it said.  PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan on Monday said that the cyclone named Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which could result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas. Meanwhile, the Met Office said the sea breezes could resume in the evening or night in Karachi.  During the next 24 hours, the sky would remain partly cloudy with intermittent light rains or drizzling in the port city, the PMD said in its daily forecast. It said the minimum temperature was recorded to be 23.5°C and the city may clock 30-32°C maximum during the day. The weather department recorded the humidity ratio in the air at 91%."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of an \"indirect dialogue\" with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led (PML-N) leaders strongly opposed talks with their political nemesis. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal linked the holding of any dialogue with the PTI apologising for allegedly staging last year's May 9 violent protests that saw attacks on public properties including military installations following party founder Imran Khan's arrest in a corruption case.  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also opposed the talks with the former ruling party, saying he is not favour of any such dialogue.  Previously, the ruling parties extended an olive branch to Imran Khan-founded party several times but to no avail, as latter stating he will hold talks with those who wield real power in the country. The ruling party leaders' statements came amid reports that the PML-N had purportedly approached Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai for holding talks with the PTI.  Achakzai, who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Ain-e-Pakistan,  was nominated by jailed Khan to hold talks with the ruling parties. Responding to the report, Asif – while speaking to journalists – said that he wasn’t part of “team assigned to talk to PkMAP chairman”. When asked whether talks should be held with the former ruling party, the PML-N stalwart said: “I’m not in favour of negotiations.” Meanwhile, Iqbal also opposed dialogue with PTI until Imran Khan “apologises for the violence carried out on May 9”. Speaking to journalists after a consultative meeting of PML-N leadership, the planning minister claimed that PTI, in collaboration with India, had the “anti-Pakistan” resolution passed in the US House of Representatives that sought probe into the alleged irregularities in the February 8 general elections. Criticising the PTI, the minister accused the party of causing more damage than terrorists and questioned the possibility of dialogue with such individuals.  Iqbal further said that the deposed premier was “enjoying five-star facilities in the jail”, adding that they also faced imprisonment but never complained. “He [Imran] wants NRO [National Reconciliation Ordinance] which he will not get,” he said while referring to the deal granted by former president Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf to close down corruption cases against his political rivals. ‘Talks within constitutional limits’ Earlier on Aug 3, Imran said that he was open to talks but only within the “ambit provisioned by the Constitution”. Khan had clarified that he has, in fact, asked Achakzai to negotiate with political parties. \"Achakzai will only [hold] talk with political parties,\" he said.  The incarcerated politico had in July also put forward three conditions to hold talks with the government in a bid to bring political stability in the country.  \"The first condition is that my cases should be dismissed, the second is to release our party members and third is to return our mandate,\" Khan said while having an informal talk with the journalists in Adiala Jail where has been incarcerated since August 5 last year in multiple cases ranging from corruption to terrorism."

  "content": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government safely rescued hundreds of tourists stranded in Kumrat Valley in Upper Dir District on Saturday as authorities swung into action after Geo News aired reports on destruction in the tourist destination following heavy rains. Following stormy rains a few days ago, the tourist destination disconnected from the rest of the province after floods swept away an arterial road, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded in the Kumrat Valley. A spokesperson of the KP's Tourism and Culture Authority confirmed that 200 tourists have been rescued today from Dojangla, Kala Chesma and Abshar along with the police and district administration. He said that the tourists were assembled at a local hotel where they would be shifted to Kalam. Food and other services were being provided to all tourists, he added. The tourists told Geo News that they were stranded in Kumrat for several hours as the only road from Thall Bazaar to upper areas like Kalam and others was washed away in the floods. They thanked Geo News for highlighting their plight which led to a rescue operation by the authorities. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of the province said in its latest report that the main road from Thall to Kumrat was washed out at multiple places, including Barikot Kalkot and Patrak, due to sliding and flash floods yesterday. However, no casualty was reported today. Additionally, the bridge in Mohandri was affected and blocked for traffic due to a flood in Manuur Nullah two days ago, allowing citizens to only cross the bridge on foot. The ongoing rains and floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have claimed the lives of at least 88 people from July 1 till date, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Saturday. According to the authority, the persistent monsoon season has so far claimed the lives of at least 43 children, 26 men and 19 women. On the other hand, at least 129 people have been injured owing to the devastations in the wake of the torrential rains since last month. Those injured include 61 children, 39 men and 29 women, said PDMA. \"A total of 958 houses were damaged by rains,\" added the authority."

Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz told a private news channel that potential heavy rainfall and thunderstorms may hit various parts of Sindh and coastal districts of Balochistan. He highlighted the possible impacts of the cyclone on Sindh’s weather, stressing the need for preparedness and vigilance in the face of potentially severe weather conditions. Sarfaraz cautioned that despite Cyclone Asna’s trajectory towards Oman, its effects on Pakistan will still be significant. He emphasised that Balochistan, in particular, can expect more severe consequences than Sindh, with intense rainfall predicted in the region. Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warned that strong windstorms may damage crops, loose structures, like billboards, electrical poles, solar panels and hoardings. It advised general public against visiting the seaside and beach areas.

Without elaborating details, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho on Wednesday said that new details emerged from the ongoing investigation into the Karsaz road accident, which suggested that the suspect shouldn't have been driving the vehicle.  Speaking to journalists, Odho had said he doesn’t want to divulge the details as investigation into the incident was still underway. \"A final opinion could only be made after holding consultation with medical authorities,\" he had said, adding that the police will also take medical experts on board in this regard. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on August 19. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was reportedly in critical condition. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. As per the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on the phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the SUV driver hit his brother’s bike from the rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving license, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. They said that charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR."

  "content": "The ongoing rains and floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have claimed the lives of at least 88 people from July 1 till date, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Saturday. According to the authority, the persistent monsoon season has so far claimed the lives of at least 43 children, 26 men and 19 women.

As per the official, efforts are being made to evacuate the tourists safely today. \"At least 50 to 70 tourists have also been asked to come to Jaaz Banda,\" said Ali. The rehabilitation of the Dir-Kumrat highway at Barikot has also begun, while the government is providing food and drinking items to the trapped tourists, said the official. Pakistan is hit by heavy monsoon rains with the Pakistan Meteorological Department forecasting more widespread rain with windstorm all across the country for the next few days. In a statement released on Friday, the Met Office said heavy rainfall was likely in Sindh, northeast/south Balochistan, northeast/central Punjab, Potohar region, Islamabad, KP, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Kashmir in 24 hours.

On the other hand, PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan — while addressing a presser — said that the cyclone namely Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which may result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas. \"Cyclones usually advance from sea to land but Asna's advancement is vice versa [...] It will intensify into a hurricane whose impacts will be seen in the next week,\" he added. \"Our country is receiving more than usual downpours due to this cyclone. Upper areas of the country will experience more rain from September 2 to 4.\" Mehar predicted that the weather conditions would improve in southern areas after two days.  The port city has not yet witnessed any serious impacts of the cyclonic storm near to its coast as some parts received light showers since Friday morning.

  "content": " After the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) joined hands with the major opposition party — Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — on the parliamentary front, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday held a meeting with the religio-political party's chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman \"to address his reservations\". In the meeting, PM Shehbaz assured Fazl that his reservations would be addressed, sources told Geo News. The federal government has tried to engage Maulana Fazl after he expressed his reservations on multiple issues with the incumbent government being ruled by the coalition government led by the PML-N.  In the crucial meeting, the federal government sought the JUI-F chief's support and assistance to deal with the challenges facing the country, the sources added. They added that the meeting was meant to appease Maulana Fazl who openly slammed the coalition government and levelled serious allegations of rigging in the February 8 nationwide polls. Before the 2024 general elections, Fazl was one of the closest allies of the PML-N and the PPP who headed the multi-party opposition alliance — Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — who successfully ousted the former premier Imran Khan from office via a no-confidence motion in 2022. Apparently pointing towards the JUI-F-PTI \"cooperation agreement\", the premier remarked that Fazl is a democratic politician and requested the latter to reject the \"politics of the anarchist group\", as per the insiders. The incumbent government increased efforts to woo the former ally — JUI-F — through the recent meetings after the religio-political party reached a consensus on cooperation in the National Assembly and the Senate almost a week ago amid reports that the federal government was planning to table key legislation in parliament. The ruling coalition leaders met Fazl after his latest meeting with the PTI delegation led by party's Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. Both the parties, who have traditionally been arch-rivals, had held multiple interactions since the February 8 polls owing to their mutual concerns regarding alleged election result manipulation and irregularities in the polls. It was the second meeting by another top political figure of the coalition government following Fazl's engagement with President Asif Ali Zardari last week in which they discussed potential key legislation rumoured to be tabled in parliament. Additionally, PM Shehbaz's administration is also busy holding deliberations with its allies these days amid speculations of tabling judiciary-centric legislation, including changes in the laws related to the top jurist's appointments based on the principle of seniority. Earlier this week, the Imran Khan-founded party's chairman had alleged that the coalition government was “secretly working on legislation” instead of discussing legislative matters in parliamentary party meetings before convening parliament’s sessions. Gohar had said that his party \"would oppose any kind of extension\" in the tenure of the judges. His statement pointed towards the rumoured legislation of the incumbent government to grant an extension to the top judge who is set to retire in October this year. However, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar had told Geo News that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new CJP is \"seniority\" and rejected the opposition’s allegations. Advising against politicising the appointment of judges, the minister said that unnecessary debate should not be held on the matter. Moreover, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar also rejected the reports stating that constitutional amendment cannot be introduced in the joint sitting. Speaking to Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now."

  "content": "A Pakistani artist, Shabir Ahmed Mir, has masterfully conceptualised the resilience and spirit of the 2022 earthquake victims in Turkey with his sculpture, \"Life,\" showcased at the Kommogene Biennale 2024, garnering critical acclaim.  On February 6, 2022, an earthquake struck Adiyaman and 10 other provinces in southern Turkey, leaving more than 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands homeless as it razed or damaged an equal number of buildings, prompting a long and severely painful recovery. Mir was invited to the second Kommagene Biennale, an art and sculpture exhibition based in the city of Kâhta in Adiyaman, one of the provinces most devastated by the disaster.  This year the event commemorated the trauma and suffering of those affected by the 2022 earthquake and celebrated their perseverance.  As the theme of the event was “Rising,” Mir was tasked with expressing the pain of the people through the use of local materials and crafts from the province. Mir's work, created from mattress springs, symbolises the \"intricacies of life\" and the unwavering perseverance of a people who have endured immense hardship. In an exclusive interview with Geo.tv, Mir shared his experience of building the piece from scratch, noting that it took “three days of build-up” under challenging conditions. “I was there for 16 days. It took a considerable amount of time for material selection and build-up —roughly eight days of intense hard work. The major challenge was constructing the sculpture on the island, which is uneven, barren land with no shade, and in scorching heat. It took me almost three days just for the build-up,” says Mir. At the Kommagene Biennale 2024, 54 artists were invited to display their works, including 27 from abroad and 27 from Turkey. Mir, a recipient of numerous accolades including the Ring of Life award at the 9th edition of Dubai Design Week 2023 and the Magzoid Emerging Art Icons Award 2023 for Best Installation Art, regards his participation in the Turkish Biennale as a great honour. “It was a great honour to be selected out of 200 submitted proposals. It gives me great pleasure that my work has won the trust of esteemed jury members Nihat Ozdal, Dr Habil Prof Istvan Eross, Ri Eung-woo, Dr Habil Prof Kristaps Zarins, Varol Topac, and Dr Habil Prof ASP Bogdan Achimescu,\" the artist said extending his heartfelt appreciation. Mir, an alumnus of the National College of Arts (NCA) Lahore, says he has a passion for sculptures and calligraphy and his art piece at the Biennale, reflects both his artistic zeal and the resilience and perseverance of the people of Turkey. Looking at “Life,” it is clear that the art piece holds a much deeper and more symbolic meaning. When asked about the deeper significance of his creation, Mir explains that his piece, made from “mattress springs,” reflects the “intricacies of life.” “Our lives are threads of reality, dreams, and aspirations, intricately woven to form our unique worlds. Inspired by the curatorial concept and Turkey’s history of natural disasters, the piece titled “Life” is crafted from mattress springs,” the sculptor said. Unsurprisingly, Mir’s choice of material carries significant meaning, relating to the persistent echoes that follow death, destruction, and earthquakes. “This material choice serves to evoke a deep awareness of the lingering impact of earthquakes. The springs, remnants of disrupted sleep, symbolise the anxiety and sleepless nights endured by those affected,” according to the award-winning artist.    Turks have faced numerous natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and wildfires, yet they have remained steadfast in the face of adversity. Mir believes that his masterpiece incorporates these elements effectively. “Through this installation, the work captures the resilience of a people who, despite overwhelming loss, have found the strength to rise again, even when basic necessities were beyond reach,” he said. “It also talks about the fragility of life and illusions that we live with. We make plans, build our lives, and create complex lifestyles, yet it's all an illusion. Life in reality is this fragile on unstable grounds,” he added. Even from a short distance, 'Life' gives the impression of vibrations visible to the naked eye due to the springs used in its construction. This effect serves the artwork's purpose: representing people standing determined and tall despite instabilities, earthquakes, and other disasters, amid the illusions of life and the lack of assurance that haunts humans. The structure wholly embodies the perseverance of a people.  Mir said that when he was in Turkey, he had the opportunity to speak to some of the survivors of the 2022 earthquake, who shared their experiences of life after the disaster, helping the artist understand their months-long ordeal in recovering from the tragedy. “I was lucky to have interacted with a few locals to get their thoughts on the aftermath of the 2022 earthquake. It took them months to get out of the fear, pain and anxiety,” Mir stated. Mir’s resilient artwork remained in the limelight at the Kommagene Biennale 2024, showcasing his masterful artistry and out-of-this-world creativity \"The opening ceremony tour was fantastic. I received an overwhelming response from officials, artists, and public representatives. Although I had to leave after the opening ceremony, I was informed by the organisers that visitors were drawn to my work,” the NCA alumnus said, concluding his talk with Geo.tv. The Kommogene Biennale 2024, which began on August 24, will be open to art enthusiasts to visit and view the displayed pieces until November 8, 2024."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: As a leading economist of the country, Dr Kaiser Bengali stepped down from his postition in the official committees, the government termed the development to be based on a \"misunderstanding\".  Bengali tendered his resignation on Saturday, citing the \"biased rightsizing\" as the reason of his decision.  \"Not only positions from grades 1 to 16 but all government positions from grades 1 to 22 are being right-sized,” a government spokesperson told Geo News on Sunday. He said that scores of high-ranking officials would also be put on the chopping block. “The rightsizing committee has reviewed six ministries so far, in the first phase. Dissolution of one ministry has been approved, while two others will be merged.” In this context, at least two officers of BPS-22 and several others from BPS-17 to BPS-21 may be terminated as their positions would become redundant, the spokesperson said, describing the economist's claim as a misunderstanding. The official remarked that approximately 60,000 positions could become surplus, including posts from grades 17 to 22. Bengali on Saturday stepped down from three government committees formed to cut expenditures and carry out institutional rightsizing, warning that the economy “is on a ventilator due to [mounting] debts and on the path to destruction”. He accused the government of targeting employees in grades 1 to 16 while sparing officials of higher grades in its rightsizing drive. “The rightsizing committee respects Bengali's opinion, however, it appears to be based on a lack of information.” The official asserted that in this regard the committee was comprehensively and impartially reviewing the autonomous and government organisations.  Meanwhile, he said, the federal cabinet was highlighting various aspects of the recommendations approved by the rightsizing committee. The spokesperson said the government was working on a compulsory retirement package with necessary amendments to the Civil Servants Act, of 1973, as well. “This package can be applied to all civil servants without any favour or preference,” the spox said. Bengali has sent his resignation to Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb and Cabinet Division Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. He was a member of key bodies for austerity, rightsizing and expenditure reduction committees formed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition government to deal with the economic crisis after it returned to power after the 2024 general elections. His resignation comes at a time when the government is claiming to make all-out efforts to come out of the economic crisis via austerity measures, rightsizing and privatisation of unnecessary and loss-making state-owned entities, as well as seeking another bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In his statement, Bengali praised the incumbents for initiating \"good efforts\" to reduce its spending and termed the three committees crucial for cutting down the government's expenditure. Detailing his services, the economist said that all three committees tabled recommendations to the federal government for reducing the government's expenses. He added that the panels suggested shutting down 17 divisions and 50 departments after precisely reviewing the functioning and effectiveness of 70 government institutions and 17 corporations. “This government is taking steps against the recommendations [of the committees],” Bengali said slamming the decisions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's administration. “Junior employees — from Grade 1 to 16 — are being terminated instead of high-ranking officers from Grade 17 to 22 to reduce the expenses,” he alleged. “Jobs of Grades 17 to 22 officers in different departments are being protected [by the federal government]. If we remove these high-ranking officers, we could have cut our financial expenses by Rs30 billion annually,” he claimed. His statement cast doubt on the recent government moves to rightsize federal ministries and institutions, including restructuring of the state-owned utility stores, closure of the Public Works Department (PWD), and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). It is also worth mentioning here that the federal cabinet was also informed earlier this week regarding the merger of 82 government bodies related to different ministries and their dissolution into 40 institutions in light of the rightsizing committee's recommendations. Bengali, who has a master's degree in economics from Boston University, USA, and a PhD degree in economics from the University of Karachi, warned that the economy is “on the path to destruction” due to the piling up of debts. The people are compelled to commit suicide as it's become difficult for the masses to manage household budgets, the economist added. Throwing shade at the PML-N government's economic policies, he claimed that global institutions, including the IMF, have refused to disburse loans to Pakistan."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday expressed satisfaction with the recent decline in inflation rates and Pakistan's upgraded ratings by Moody’s, stating that the country’s economy is moving towards stability. Welcoming the forecast that inflation may continue to decrease in September, the Prime Minister noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to a record low of 11% in July 2024, which is heartening to note, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The Ministry of Finance — in its monthly outlook report — stated that on account of stability in economic indicators, inflation was expected to remain within the range of 9.5-10.5% in August and further decline to 9-10% in September. “After Fitch, a global rating agency, Moody’s recently upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating, which is an acknowledgement of the country’s positive economic indicators by the international financial institutions,” PM Shehbaz said in the statement. The government is actively pursuing economic reforms, with rapid progress in implementing its rightsizing policy, which is being directly monitored by the Premier, according to the communique. The PM expressed confidence that the positive impact of these reforms on the economy would become visible soon. He also highlighted that the federal and Punjab governments had provided significant relief to electricity consumers regarding monthly bills, adding that the prices of petroleum products were further reduced from today. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government recently announced a reduction of Rs14 per unit in the electricity tariff for August and September under a power subsidy plan for consumers using 201 to 500 units. \"The government is committed to passing on the benefits of these policies to the public and is aware of the people’s issues, actively working to address them,” the premier said. Earlier in August, Moody's Ratings upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 owing to improvement in macroeconomic conditions. “We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured MTN programme to (P)Caa2 from (P)Caa3. Concurrently, the outlook for the Government of Pakistan has changed to positive from stable,” the rating agency said in a statement. Accordingly, Pakistan's default risk has reduced to a level consistent with a Caa2 rating, as per Moody’s.  “There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of $7 billion.” The release of the IMF's executive board's latest schedule is a significant development, but the absence of Pakistan's loan approval on the agenda is a cause of concern as the country must secure the loan to shore up its sinking economy. On the other hand, the government is optimistic that the country will secure approval for a $7 billion bailout package from the IMF next month, sources privy to the matters told Geo News earlier this week. Finance Minister Aurangzeb last week dismissed concerns about the IMF declining the staff-level agreement, exuding confidence that \"the lender will approve it next month\". Pakistan and the global lender reached an agreement on the 37-month loan programme in July. The IMF said the programme was subject to approval from its Executive Board and obtaining \"timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners\"."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government's investigation team looking into the independent power producers (IPPs) issue summoned owners of 13 companies after it discovered \"additional profiteering\" by power plants established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), sources told Geo News on Sunday. With Special Assistant to PM (SAPM) on Power Division Muhammad Ali playing a key role in the probe, the IPP owners have been directed to bring financial reports tomorrow, the sources added. The development comes after the Senate's Functional Committee on Devolution, last month, directed the related ministry to conduct a forensic audit of the IPPs with chair Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur expressing concerns about the functioning of the IPPs and the lack of transparency in contracts with them. The IPPs have been in the light for some time now over their alleged involvement in exorbitant electricity bills that have drawn a strong reaction from the inflation-weary masses. There have been calls to review the government's existing agreements with the IPP — the most notable one coming from Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) which staged a 14-day sit-in in Rawalpindi and demanded the renegotiation of contracts with the IPPs among other things. The government has admitted that the country has the highest electricity tariffs in the region with Energy Minister Awais Leghari saying that the nation would receive \"good news\" regarding the IPPs soon. However, it is unlikely that there might be any unilateral change in IPPs contracts as Leghari, earlier this week, said that the government could not unilaterally terminate agreements and warned that such a move will lead the country to face a \"Reko Diq-like situation\". Responding to questions at the Senate's Standing Committee on Power, the minister — who also chairs a task force reviewing the IPP issue — argued against unilaterally ending these power purchase agreements with the IPPs blamed for massive power tariffs, saying that the contracts have a sovereign guarantee cover. Providing details on the ongoing probe involving the IPP issue, sources said that influential members of the investigation team have visited various plants to collect records and data. With senior executives set to converge in the federal capital following interrogation in various cities, the government aims to woo IPP owners underscoring the country's need for their support. Furthermore, it has been decided to reduce the capacity payment and profit of government-owned power plants. Also, the government is set to hold high-level talks with Chinese IPPs to seek concessions. It is to be noted that in July, Islamabad initiated talks on re-profiling its power sector debt to China, alongside talks on structural reforms suggested by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Power Division, however, has refuted the reports regarding the summoning of IPP owners saying that no IPP owner was directed to appear before the investigation committee. The sources have stressed that no unilateral action was being taken regarding IPPs contracts and that achieving a consensus is not possible without hearing IPPs. They also added that talks with the IPPs have been going on for days with the Leghari-headed task force at the helm of it."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Remembering Syed Ali Shah Geelani on his third death anniversary, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday paid tribute to the iconic Kashmiri leader for his fight for the rights of the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Geelani, whose well-known statement, \"We are Kashmiris and Pakistan is our country,\" inspired millions, passed away on September 1, 2021, in Srinagar following a protracted house arrest. In his message, President Zardari said the Kashmiri leader was a beacon of hope and resistance, inspiring countless Kashmiris to stand firm in their quest for self-determination. \"His tireless efforts and sacrifices for the just cause of the Kashmiri people will forever be etched in our hearts and minds,” he said, adding that he was a great leader and his commitment to the right to self-determination for the people of IIOJK was unyielding. Despite being subjected to house arrests and incarcerations by the Indian occupational forces, President Zardari said that he continued to raise his voice for the people of IIOJK. \"His personal hardships, including years of confinement, could not break his spirit or deter him from his mission.\" He added: “Geelani sahib remained focused on the ultimate goal, and never allowed the attention of the Kashmiri people to be diverted from the pursuit of their fundamental right to self-determination. \"His leadership and unwavering stance against oppression have left a lasting impression on the people of IIOJK. “Today, we reaffirm the resolve not to let the sacrifices of Syed Ali Shah Geelani and countless others go in vain. We will continue to advocate for the realisation of the people of IIOJK’s right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. “I assure my Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan will continue to provide moral, diplomatic, and political support for their just cause,” the president maintained. He said as we remember Geelani, we must learn from his exemplary courage and unwavering commitment to freedom and justice. “May Allah Almighty shower His blessings on Syed Ali Shah Geelani. A’ameen,” he said. On the other hand, paying tribute to the late Kashmiri leader, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s continuing moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiri people of the IIOJK. The premier, eulogising Geelani, said that his name would always be remembered and respected in the movement for the freedom of IIOJK. “Geelani had been a great Kashmiri leader who had a firm faith in the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination. Late Geelani had devoted his entire life to the achievement of the same objective,” the PM Office media wing, in an official statement, quoted the prime minister as saying. The premier further said that Geelani’s contributions to the freedom of the Kashmiri people and the struggle for the right to self-determination would always be remembered, adding suffering experienced during imprisonment could not deter Geelani’s strong resolve. “His sacrifices would not go in vain,” the prime minister said, adding that the struggle for the right to self-determination would continue."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan on Sunday rebuked reports suggesting the prospects of indirect talks between his party and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), saying the Imran Khan-founded party has not offered any dialogue to the ruling party. Speaking to Geo News, Barrister Gohar noted that only matters pertaining to the National Assembly were discussed during their meeting with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and said: \"The PTI neither offered any talks nor sought any favours.\" His statement comes in the wake of reports backing the prospects of dialogue between the PTI and its arch-rival the PML-N. In contrast to the PTI chairman's rebuttal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman and the PTI-led opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Aiyeen-e-Pakistan chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai confirmed the offer of negotiations by the PML-N, The News reported on Sunday. \"All the political leadership, including Nawaz Sharif, is on the same page with regard to the Constitution, I have met Rana Sanaullah. There is no other way to take the country forward except through negotiations,\" Achakzai said during an informal conversation with journalists in Islamabad. Recalling that the PTI had picked him to lead the negotiations, Achakzai remarked that the former ruling party should have given a positive response to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer of talks and that apart from Khan, the party leadership's opposition to dialogue did not matter. Despite the veteran politician's confirmation, ambiguity surrounds the prospects of PTI-PML-N talks as incarcerated Khan has time again ruled out negotiations with the Nawaz Sharif-led party, saying that he would hold only talk with those who wield real power in the country. \"Achakzai will only [hold] talk with political parties,\" Khan said last month while stressing that he was open to talks but only within the \"ambit provisioned by the Constitution\". A day earlier, two senior PML-N leaders — Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — expressed their opposition to the prospects of talks with the PTI wherein the former conditioned it with the issuance of an apology by Khan's party for allegedly staging last year's May 9 violent protests.  Meanwhile, Asif, while highlighting that he wasn't part of the team assigned to talk to the PkMAP chairman, said that he was not in favour of any such dialogue with the former ruling party. Elaborating on his meeting with the NA speaker, Barrister Gohar clarified that there was no discussion on dialogue. \"No PTI member parliament is in contact with the PML-N leadership over talks [...] neither the PTI's parliamentary leadership has held any negotiations with the PML-N and nor do [we] have such wish,\" the PTI chairman said. Separately however, the publication has reported the PTI chief saying: \"We have not been told by anyone but the formation of a government committee for negotiations is a good thing.\""

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan steps up its fight against mpox after fears of Peshawar’s becoming a focal point for the viral disease grow with the emergence of the infectious disease’s fourth case from the metropolis, climbing the nationwide tally to five this year on Sunday. The fresh case of mpox was detected in a 47-year-old man on August 29, after he was isolated by the Border Health Services staff. The patient had returned from the Middle East, raising concerns about the disease’s stemming from travellers arriving from the Gulf region. \"This is the fifth mpox case reported this year [in the country] and the fourth since WHO declared mpox a global health emergency,\" said Dr Shabana Saleem, the federal director general of health, on Sunday. \"The virus's re-emergence in Peshawar raises serious concerns about its transmission and demands immediate action.\" She emphasised the need for vigilance, highlighting that all recent cases have involved individuals with a history of travel to Gulf countries. \"Peshawar appears to be turning into an epicentre for mpox cases,\" she said. \"This trend is alarming, and we are doubling our efforts to prevent further spread.\" Authorities have ramped up measures to contain the virus, with stringent screening protocols now enforced at all airports. “We are not taking any chances. Effective screening systems are operational across the country,” Dr Saleem assured, noting the government’s commitment to safeguarding public health. Federal and provincial health officials are coordinating closely to monitor the situation, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken swiftly. \"We are working round the clock to ensure all preventive measures are in place and effective,\" Dr Saleem said. \"The Ministry of Health is continuously monitoring the situation, and we are prepared to respond to any developments immediately.\" The spike in mpox cases in Peshawar has triggered concerns among health experts and the public alike, with calls for increased awareness and stricter travel guidelines. The federal director general of health urged the public to remain vigilant and to comply with health advisories, particularly those returning from high-risk regions. \"Public cooperation is crucial in preventing the spread of mpox,\" she warned. \"Together, we can curb this virus before it takes a firmer hold.\""

  "content": "PESHAWAR: Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) minister for communication and works Shakeel Ahmad Khan has demanded a judicial inquiry into corruption allegations hurled against him. Speaking to Geo News Shakeel said: \"A judicial inquiry should be conducted into the allegations of corruption against me [...] I'm [even] ready for an investigation by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\" His demand comes after he stepped down as provincial minister last month over alleged corruption and bad governance by the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur-led government in the province. \"That the provincial government has compromised on its basic principles and commitments we made with the public at large at the election campaign [....] Bad governance and corruption at all levels of the provincial government has destroyed the image of the party programme and manifesto in the ranks and files of party workers,\" Shakeel wrote in his resignation letter. However, the provincial government, while dismissing the allegations, had de-notified him saying that the former minister was sacked on corruption charges, The News had reported. Shakeel's resignation has seemingly created a rift in the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership with Atif Khan and Junaid Akbar putting their weight behind Shakeel — a move which apparently didn't sit well with Gandapur's administration which de-notified Akbar after his overt support for the former minister. Referring to the three-member committee formed by the party to monitor corruption and governance in the KP, Shakeel said: \"It is a bad government committee.\" Noting that the former president Arif Alvi has assured him of arranging a meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan, Shakeel said that he would communicate everything to the incarcerated former prime minister upon meeting him. He also said that he would only remain silent till the party's September 8 rally and would present his point of view to the public after the public gathering. The remarks refer to the PTI's public rally in Islamabad which was rescheduled to September 8 after being called off by the party leadership following the administration's refusal to grant necessary permission."

  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Sunday said with the threat of \"Asna\" and its effects are almost over as the cyclonic storm has moved \"far off\" Karachi’s coastal region. Nevertheless, the PMD said, light rain or drizzling may lash Karachi because of the persisting clouds.  Strong winds had also suspended as speed of wind blowing from the north-east was recorded to be 12 kilometres in the morning, the weather forecasting department said. It said the cyclonic storm had moved as far away from Karachi as 500 kilometres in the south-east and 350km from Ormara in the south and south-east. While, it has gone off 260km in south-east of Gwadar, it maintained. The department gave permission to the Sindh fishermen to resume their activities in the sea from today and warned Balochistan fishermen not to go into deep sea for another day. “About 60-70km wind may blow in the cyclone Asna, in the meanwhile,” it said.  PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan on Monday said that the cyclone named Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which could result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas. Meanwhile, the Met Office said the sea breezes could resume in the evening or night in Karachi. During the next 24 hours, the sky would remain partly cloudy with intermittent light rains or drizzling in the port city, the PMD said in its daily forecast. It said the minimum temperature was recorded to be 23.5°C and the city may clock 30-32°C maximum during the day. The weather department recorded the humidity ratio in the air at 91%."

  "content": "As many as 200 tourists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kumrat Valley in Upper Dir District were rescued after the authorities began an operation following reports aired by Geo News on the destruction caused by heavy rains in the area. Following stormy rains a few days ago, the tourist destination disconnected from the rest of the province after floods swept away an arterial road, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded in the Kumrat Valley. A spokesperson of the KP's Tourism and Culture Authority confirmed that 200 tourists have been rescued today from Dojangla, Kala Chesma and Abshar along with the police and district administration. He said that the tourists were assembled at a local hotel where they would be shifted to Kalam. Food and other services were being provided to all tourists, he added. The tourists told Geo News that they were stranded in Kumrat for several hours as the only road from Thall Bazaar to upper areas like Kalam and others was washed away in the floods. They thanked Geo News for highlighting their plight which led to a rescue operation by the authorities. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of the province said in its latest report that the main road from Thall to Kumrat was washed out at multiple places, including Barikot Kalkot and Patrak, due to sliding and flash floods yesterday. However, no casualty was reported today. Additionally, the bridge in Mohandri was affected and blocked for traffic due to a flood in Manuur Nullah two days ago, allowing citizens to only cross the bridge on foot. The ongoing rains and floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have claimed the lives of at least 88 people from July 1 till date, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Saturday. According to the authority, the persistent monsoon season has so far claimed the lives of at least 43 children, 26 men and 19 women. On the other hand, at least 129 people have been injured owing to the devastations in the wake of the torrential rains since last month. Those injured include 61 children, 39 men and 29 women, said PDMA. \"A total of 958 houses were damaged by rains,\" added the authority."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders on Saturday opposed holding dialogue with the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) amid report that the ruling party had \"indirectly approached\" its political rival for talks.    As per a report, the PML-N had purportedly approached Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai for holding talks with the PTI. The report quoting sources stated that Rana Sanaullah, senior PMLN leader and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs, has been assigned by the party leadership to talk to Achakzai.  Mahmood Khan, who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Ain-e-Pakistan, was nominated by jailed Khan to hold negotiations with the ruling parties. However, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal strongly opposed dialogue with former ruling party with the latter linking the holding of any talks with the PTI apologising for allegedly staging last year's May 9 violent protests that saw attacks on public properties including military installations following party founder Imran Khan's arrest in a corruption case.  Responding to the report, Asif – while speaking to journalists – said that he wasn’t part of “team assigned to talk to PkMAP chairman”. When asked whether talks should be held with the former ruling party, the PML-N stalwart said: “I’m not in favour of negotiations.” Meanwhile, Iqbal also opposed dialogue with PTI until Imran Khan “apologises for the violence carried out on May 9”. Speaking to journalists after a consultative meeting of PML-N leadership, the planning minister claimed that PTI, in collaboration with India, had the “anti-Pakistan” resolution passed in the US House of Representatives that sought probe into the alleged irregularities in the February 8 general elections. Criticising the PTI, the minister accused the party of causing more damage than terrorists and questioned the possibility of dialogue with such individuals.  Iqbal further said that the deposed premier was “enjoying five-star facilities in the jail”, adding that they also faced imprisonment but never complained. “He [Imran] wants NRO [National Reconciliation Ordinance] which he will not get,” he said while referring to the deal granted by former president Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf to close down corruption cases against his political rivals. Earlier on Aug 3, Imran said that he was open to talks but only within the “ambit provisioned by the Constitution”. Khan had clarified that he has, in fact, asked Achakzai to negotiate with political parties. \"Achakzai will only [hold] talk with political parties,\" he said. The incarcerated politico had in July also put forward three conditions to hold talks with the government in a bid to bring political stability in the country. \"The first condition is that my cases should be dismissed, the second is to release our party members and third is to return our mandate,\" Khan said while having an informal talk with the journalists in Adiala Jail where has been incarcerated since August 5 last year in multiple cases ranging from corruption to terrorism."

  "content": "Sporadic rains hit parts of Karachi despite the cyclonic storm — Asna — in the Arabian Sea moved further westward from the Sindh coast during the past six hours. The areas which received moderate to heavy rains include Gurumandir, Numaish, Lasbela, Soldier Bazaar, Tariq Road, I I Chundrigar Road and its adjoining areas. In a fresh alert issued at 9:36pm today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted rain-thundershowers with few heavy falls clubbed with squally winds (60-70kph) in Balochistan's Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Ormara, Pasni, Gwadar, Jiwani, Turbat, Panjgur till tomorrow night. It also warned about water logging in low-lying areas of Makran coast. The cyclone is now lies at around Latitude 23.2 N & Longitude 63.8 E at a distance of about 370km southwest of Karachi, 250km southwest of Ormara and 260km south-southeast of Gwadar, it added. \"The system is likely to track further westwards till tomorrow, then turn southwestward and weaken gradually,\" the weather department said. A previous alert forecasted heavy rains in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, however, the change in the cyclone's trajectory ended the chances of further downpours. The PMD advised fishermen of Balochistan not to venture into the open sea till September 1 night due to rough sea conditions with squally winds of 60-70kph gusting 80kph. It allowed Sindh fishermen to resume their activities from Sunday (tomorrow). Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz told a private news channel that potential heavy rainfall and thunderstorms may hit various parts of Sindh and coastal districts of Balochistan. He highlighted the possible impacts of the cyclone on Sindh’s weather, stressing the need for preparedness and vigilance in the face of potentially severe weather conditions. Sarfaraz cautioned that despite Cyclone Asna’s trajectory towards Oman, its effects on Pakistan will still be significant. He emphasised that Balochistan, in particular, can expect more severe consequences than Sindh, with intense rainfall predicted in the region. Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warned that strong windstorms may damage crops, loose structures, like billboards, electrical poles, solar panels and hoardings. It advised general public against visiting the seaside and beach areas. Thunderstorms may increase risk of lightning strikes and electricity, along with other utility services may get disrupted, the NDMA said. The authority has issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather. The Met Department released statistics of the five-day monsoon spell continued in the provincial capital of Sindh from August 27 to 31.   — With additional input from APP"

  "content": "KARACHI: A new case has been filed against the suspect of the deadly Karsaz road mishap after methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, was discovered in her blood and urine samples, Geo News reported on Saturday citing police.  The suspect's blood and urine samples, according to the police, were obtained by the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) shortly after the fatal accident. They added that a case was also filed on the state's behalf against the suspect on grounds of a fresh report of the medico-legal officer (MLO). Police revealed that a section pertaining to use of prohibited item has been incorporated in the case. The traces of banned substance were confirmed in the blood sample obtained from the arrested suspect, they said. Without elaborating details, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho on Wednesday said that new details emerged from the ongoing investigation into the Karsaz road accident, which suggested that the suspect shouldn't have been driving the vehicle. Speaking to journalists, Odho had said he doesn’t want to divulge the details as investigation into the incident was still underway. \"A final opinion could only be made after holding consultation with medical authorities,\" he had said, adding that the police will also take medical experts on board in this regard. A young woman and an elderly man were killed when the suspect’s luxury vehicle crashed into multiple vehicles near the Pakistan Maritime Museum on August 19. The deceased and injured were brought to the JPMC for medico-legal formalities and treatment, respectively. Those killed in the accident were identified as daughter and father, 26-year-old Aamna Arif and 60-year-old Imran Arif, while one of the injured was reportedly in critical condition. According to law enforcement officials, the woman who caused the accident received an injury on her head and her CT scan was conducted at the JPMC. The woman was going through the service road near Karsaz when, according to her, the car got out of control and caused the accident. As per the police, the case was filed by Imtiaz Arif, brother of the deceased at the Bahadurabad police station. They said charges of culpable homicide and negligence were incorporated in the FIR. The complainant said he received information about his brother’s accident on the phone and when he reached the JPMC he found his brother and niece dead. He came to know that the SUV driver hit his brother’s bike from the rear, causing the accident. Another motorcyclist Abdul Salam also got injured. Imtiaz said his brother and niece died due to the suspect's \"negligence, freewheeling and speeding\". Police said since the suspect had a driving license, therefore charges of culpable homicide will be applied to her case. They said that charges of negligence and rash driving had also been added to the FIR."

  "content": "KARACHI: Cyclone Asna is now positioned at about 300 kilometres from Karachi and Gwadar and 230km from Ormara, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in an alert issued on Saturday. As the cyclone moves away from Sindh's coastal belt, it is expected to track further west-southwestwards towards the coastal belt and then towards Oman, before dissipating in the sea without making landfall on any coast. During this time, the meteorological department expects sea conditions to remain rough with winds likely to blow at 60 to 70km/hour in the metropolis. The authority advised fishermen of Sindh not to venture into sea today while those in Balochistan must avoid going into the deep sea till tomorrow. In the wake of the cyclone, the NDMA's National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) alerted residents of potential coastal flooding along the coast of Sindh and possible pluvial flooding or inundation in low lying areas. Meanwhile, it also said that the city may experience strong windstorms, posing a threat to crops, billboards, electrical poles, solar panels and hoardings. Additionally, thunderstorms to increase risk of lightning strikes and electricity, along with other utility services may get disrupted. The public has been advised not to visit the seaside and beach areas in light of potential hazards. Residents are advised to remain vigilant and follow guidance from local authorities. NDMA has issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather.

  "content": "KARACHI: Residents of Sindh, including Karachi, are bracing for more torrential rains after the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that a deep depression — currently about 120km southeast of the port city — has intensified into Cyclone Asna. The storm is moving towards the Arabian Sea along the province’s coast.  According to an advisory from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued at 10:44pm tonight, the Cyclonic Storm “ASNA” over northeast Arabian Sea off Sindh coast has moved westward during past 6 hours and now lies at about 120km south of Karachi and 180 southwest of Thatta. “The system is likely keep moving initially west-northwestwards and then west-southwestwards,” the advisory stated.

On the other hand, PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan — while addressing a presser — said that the cyclone namely Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which may result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas. \"Cyclones usually advance from sea to land but Asna's advancement is vice versa [...] It will intensify into a hurricane whose impacts will be seen in the next week,\" he added. \"Our country is receiving more than usual downpours due to this cyclone. Upper areas of the country will experience more rain from September 2 to 4.\" Mehar predicted that the weather conditions would improve in southern areas after two days.

  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday met Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman who agreed to cooperate with the major opposition party — the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — on the parliamentary front last week. In the meeting, PM Shehbaz assured Fazl that his reservations would be addressed, sources told Geo News. The federal government has tried to engage Maulana Fazl after he expressed his reservations on multiple issues with the incumbent government being ruled by the coalition government led by the PML-N. In the crucial meeting, the federal government sought the JUI-F chief's support and assistance to deal with the challenges facing the country, the sources added. They added that the meeting was meant to appease Maulana Fazl who openly slammed the coalition government and levelled serious allegations of rigging in the February 8 nationwide polls. Before the 2024 general elections, Fazl was one of the closest allies of the PML-N and the PPP who headed the multi-party opposition alliance — Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — who successfully ousted the former premier Imran Khan from office via a no-confidence motion in 2022. Apparently pointing towards the JUI-F-PTI \"cooperation agreement\", the premier remarked that Fazl is a democratic politician and requested the latter to reject the \"politics of the anarchist group\", as per the insiders. The incumbent government increased efforts to woo the former ally — JUI-F — through the recent meetings after the religio-political party reached a consensus on cooperation in the National Assembly and the Senate almost a week ago amid reports that the federal government was planning to table key legislation in parliament. The ruling coalition leaders met Fazl after his latest meeting with the PTI delegation led by party's Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. Both the parties, who have traditionally been arch-rivals, had held multiple interactions since the February 8 polls owing to their mutual concerns regarding alleged election result manipulation and irregularities in the polls. It was the second meeting by another top political figure of the coalition government following Fazl's engagement with President Asif Ali Zardari last week in which they discussed potential key legislation rumoured to be tabled in parliament. Additionally, PM Shehbaz's administration is also busy holding deliberations with its allies these days amid speculations of tabling judiciary-centric legislation, including changes in the laws related to the top jurist's appointments based on the principle of seniority. Earlier this week, the Imran Khan-founded party's chairman had alleged that the coalition government was \"secretly working on legislation\" instead of discussing legislative matters in parliamentary party meetings before convening parliament's sessions. Gohar had said that his party \"would oppose any kind of extension\" in the tenure of the judges. His statement pointed towards the rumoured legislation of the incumbent government to grant an extension to the top judge who is set to retire in October this year. However, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar had told Geo News that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new CJP is \"seniority\" and rejected the opposition’s allegations. Advising against politicising the appointment of judges, the minister said that unnecessary debate should not be held on the matter. Moreover, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar also rejected the reports stating that constitutional amendment cannot be introduced in the joint sitting. Speaking to Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan', Tarar categorically rejected the rumoured plans of the federal government to extend the chief justice's tenure. Tarar, the ruling PML-N leader, said that a debate was held on the judges' extension a few months ago but it was not on the government's agenda right now."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Britain's High Commissioner in Islamabad Jane Marriott has \"encouraged\" Pakistani students to apply for the Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship programmes at the United Kingdom universities. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the Commonwealth Scholarship programme as 46 Chevening and 47 Commonwealth scholarships have been awarded to Pakistanis, according to an official statement issued by the British High Commission in Islamabad on Friday. These long-standing programmes have developed a network of over 1,500 Commonwealth and nearly 2,000 Chevening alumni in Pakistan, who regularly meet to discuss live issues, it added. The statement further stated that scholars come from diverse backgrounds, representing the rich cultural tapestry of Pakistan, adding that this year’s cohort come from Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, Pakistan Administered Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and the Federal Capital Territory. Over 60% of this year’s Chevening scholars are women. The British High Commission strongly encourages people from all backgrounds and across Pakistan to apply. Talking to the students, the high commissioner offered advice to them for living in the UK, ahead of a year of studying at British universities. She said, “The Chevening programme helps develop a new generation of Pakistani leaders and change-makers. Many of our alumni have gone on to achieve extraordinary things back home.\" \"Not only do they get the benefit of studying at some of the best universities in the world, they also get to experience the best of living in the UK. From climate studies to football coaching, I am looking forward to seeing what they achieve, and encourage all those interested to apply early.” Fareeha Gull Hashmi, Assistant Manager of Oral History Project Citizens Archive of Pakistan and upcoming Chevening scholar, said: “I am thrilled to be joining the University of Essex for my MA in Heritage and Museum Studies. This programme is exactly what I was looking for to help me on my journey to improve heritage and cultural preservation in Pakistan. I can’t wait for my journey to begin.” The cohort includes those on a scholarship in Football Science, with the support of Swindon Town Football Club. For the first time, this year’s cohort also saw an additional scholarship for Heritage and Museum Studies with the support of Essex University. This scholarship will cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs. This, and a University of Essex Scholarship for Climate Studies, are again available in this year’s application cycle, as are additional scholarships from the University of Birmingham. This month, the British High Commission launched Chevening Connect in Karachi, a new debate series bringing together industry experts and Chevening alumni. The first debate, on tackling climate, looked at the technical, economic and political leadership needed to support Pakistan with adaptation and resilience.

  "content": "At least 12 terrorists have been killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Tirah Valley, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Friday. \"Since 20 August 2024, security forces are conducting extensive intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Tirah Valley, Khyber District, on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" said the military's media affairs wing in a statement. On August 28 and 29, troops effectively engaged the terrorists' locations where after intense fire exchange, 12 militants of \"Fitna-Al-Khwarij were sent to hell,\" the military's media wing said while referring to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants. The statement further said that these operations have resulted in a major setback to the TTP and its affiliates, adding that so far, 37 terrorists have been \"sent to hell\", while 14 others have suffered serious injuries. The military reaffirmed its commitment to restoring peace, saying that the IBOs will continue till peace is restored in the area and terrorists are eliminated, as the security forces are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country. Earlier today, at least five terrorists were killed and three others injured during separate IBOs in Balochistan's Kech, Panjgur and Zhob districts.  A statement issued by the ISPR said the security forces are conducting extensive IBOs to hunt down the perpetrators of the Balochistan incident. According to the military's media wing, the operations are being conducted in the backdrop of cowardly terrorist activities that targeted innocent civilians across Balochistan on August 26. \"On night August 29-30, in three separate IBOs in District Kech, Panjgur and Zhob, five terrorists were sent to hell by the security forces, while three terrorists got injured during the intense fire exchange,\" said the statement. Moreover, sanitisation operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abetters of these atrocious acts are brought to justice, it added. The IBOs were launched after at least 23 passengers on Monday were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Balochistan Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "KARACHI: The deep depression, which is gradually moving towards the Arabian Sea from India's Rann of Kutch, is now 120 kilometres southeast of the port city, the Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD) warned Friday. In its latest alert regarding the deep depression, the PMD said that the low-pressure area is now located approximately 120 kilometres southeast of the port city. It further stated that it lies around Latitude 23.8 N & Longitude 66.6 E at about 120km south of Karachi, 180 southwest of Thatta, 250km southeast of Ormara and 440km east-southeast of Gwadar. It is expected to move west-southwestward along Sindh's coastal belt and may intensify into a cyclonic storm upon entering the Arabian Sea by today afternoon or evening, subject to favourable environmental conditions. PMD Director General Mehar Sahibzada Khan said in a press conference that the cyclone namely Asna brewed off the Karachi-Gwadar coast which may result in heavy rainfalls after hitting western coastal areas.  \"Cyclones usually advance from sea to land but Asna's advancement is vice versa [...] It will intensify into a hurricane whose impacts will be seen in the next week,\" he added. \"Our country is receiving more than usual downpours due to this cyclone. Upper areas of the country will experience more rain from September 2 to 4.\" Mehar predicted that the weather conditions would improve in southern areas after two days. Furthermore, the PMD has also forecast a possibility of heavy rainfall in the provincial capital of Sindh with strong winds and thundershowers in the next 24 hours. The meteorology department's forecast on Friday recorded the minimum temperature in the metropolis at 26°C while the maximum temperature in the city is likely to be 28°C to 30°C. Meanwhile, winds in the metropolis are blowing from the northeast at a speed of 22km/hour. According to the Met Office, heavy rainfalls are likely in Sindh areas under the influence of the potential cyclonic storm. These areas include Karachi division, Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tandu Muhammad Khan, Tandu Allah Yar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts till August 31.  Additionally, heavy downpour is also likely in Hub, Lasbella, Awaran, Keach and Gwadar districts between August 30 to September 1 with occasional gaps.  Heavy rains may cause water logging or rain inundation in low lying areas of the Sindh-Makran coast while sea conditions are likely to remain rough with squally winds of 60-70kph gusting 80kph. The PMD has advised fishermen in Sindh to avoid venturing into the sea till August 31 and those of Balochistan till September 1 while residents are advised to avoid unnecessary movement. Karachi areas hit with continued rainfall in past 24hrs Several parts of the port city experienced continued rainfall on Thursday, which intensified into heavy downpour later at night, with with Sarjani Town recording the highest rainfall at 127.6 milimetres, according to the meteorological department.

  "description": "Two people were killed and nine others, including five women, were injured by a bus driver recklessly operating his vehicle on Monday, police said. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that a speeding contract bus hit and ran over a rickshaw, several motorcycles and pedestrians at Bawani Chali. As a result, two people were killed while nine others were injured, the DIG said, adding that the condition of all of the injured was critical. He said the dead and the injured were moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. He said the errant driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind his vehicle which was impounded, but was soon arrested after the police conducted raids. The DIG said the driver held a light vehicle licence but was operating a heavy vehicle. He pointed out that the bus was contracted by a textile mill and efforts were underway to arrest the bus owner as well. He added that the Site-A police registered a case against the driver on the complaint of injured Mohammed Muzamil, whose brother was killed in the incident. According to the first information report, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the suspect was booked under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons In furtherance of common intention), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 320 (punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337G (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent driving) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Muzamil said he and his brother were riding a motorcycle to a factory where they worked when the speeding bus hit them from behind. He said they were both knocked off the bike and injured, with his brother succumbing to his wounds. The casualties were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. This incident comes after a high-profile incident where a fast-moving SUV killed two people, including a woman, and injured three others near Karsaz. On August 19, a speeding Toyota Land Cruiser hit three motorcycles and another car before overturning on the city’s Karsaz Road. Sixty-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter Amna were killed in the accident, while three others were wounded. The driver was arrested and booked for manslaughter charges. In a court hearing on Aug 21, a counsel of the victim had called for a probe into the “kind of drug” that the suspect was allegedly under the influence of at the time of the accident. Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon had said the suspect’s medical report showed she was under the influence of crystal meth, although the report was not made public at the time. "

  "description": "Three people, including two army personnel, died and one was injured after a landslide struck a bus on the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in the Dasu area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Kohistan district in the early hours of Monday, officials said. Speaking to Dawn.com, Upper Kohistan District Police Officer (DPO) Mukhtiar Ahmad said a Hunza-bound passenger bus of the Northern Areas Transport Corporation was struck by big boulders, resulting in the deaths of three passengers. He said two of the deceased were army personnel and one was a civilian while one person was injured. Ahmad said two of the deceased belonged to Gilgit-Baltistan while the third was from Rawalpindi. He said the bodies and the injured were moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Dasu. Meanwhile, the KKH was blocked at several points between Bisham and Diamer after heavy rain lashed the region on Sunday night. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Abdur Rehman said a heavy downpour hit the area and the KKH was blocked at several points due to which passengers travelling to and from Islamabad were stuck. The KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a weather advisory on Monday morning saying more rains were expected in parts of the province. It said the rains may cause landsliding, thereby increasing flow in rivers and streams, which may result in urban flooding and strong winds. The PDMA requested the general public to avoid unnecessary travel and visiting mountainous regions in the north, as well as adopt safety precautions during bad weather conditions. On Friday, 12 members of a family were killed in their sleep when the roof of their mud house collapsed due to heavy rainfall in Maidan tehsil, Upper Dir, a rescue official said. Punjab authorities on alert as monsoon rains expected till Sept 4 Separately, Punjab authorities were put on alert due to monsoon rains expected in several districts within the next 24 hours. A statement from the Punjab PDMA spokesperson said the monsoon spell was expected to last till Wednesday. It added that rains were expected in Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Khushab, Sargodha, Mianwali and Chiniot today and on Tuesday. Meanwhile, thundershowers and rain were also expected in Lahore, Kasur, Narowal, Sahiwal, Toba Tek Singh, Faisalabad, Jhang and Mianwali. The statement said that intermittent rains were expected on Tuesday and Wednesday in the districts of Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Khanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Leh, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan. According to PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, the flow of water in the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, Jhelum and Sutlej rivers was at a normal level, as well as in the canals of Punjab. There was also a “normal situation” in Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan’s hill torrents, DG Kathia said. He added that the water capacity in the Mangla Dam was at 79 per cent while Tarbela Dam was at 100pc capacity. Kathi said that at present, there was no danger of flooding in the rivers of Punjab. “In view of instructions from Punjab Chief Minister [Maryam Nawaz], PDMA and other relevant authorities have been put on alert,” DG Kathia. He added that all resources were being used to protect citizens. The public was requested to take precautionary measures during monsoon rains, as well as contact the PDMA helpline 1129 in case of an emergency.         It also rained in Lahore today with a first spell from 10:30 to 1:30pm and a second spell from 4:30pm till now, according to data from the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) as of 4:52pm. Nishtar received the most rain at 107 millimetres, then Gulshan-i-Ravi (43mm), Gulberg (42mm), Tajpura (36mm), Upper Mall (31mm), Iqbal Town (14mm), Samanabad (13mm), airport area (7mm), Jail Road (6.4mm), Johar Town (6mm) and Mughalpura (2mm).

Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across Punjab over the past few weeks. Last week, one person died and five others were injured due to lighting strikes and roof collapses. Additionally, 45 cattle were reported dead in these weather-related roof collapse incidents over the past 24 hours. On August 27, Multan experienced record-breaking torrential downpour, the highest in 48 years, as a rain emergency was imposed by the Water and Sanitation Agency. Earlier in August, torrential rains in Lahore also broke a record of at least 44 years as the city witnessed a maximum rainfall of almost 360 millimetres within hours in the Airport area. "

  "description": "A full bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will hear a contempt plea over a “malicious campaign” against Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri regarding his law degree on September 19. The development comes after a controversy over Justice Jahangiri’s LLB degree, which first emerged in July, but resurfaced last week as the Karachi University’s syndicate reportedly cancelled his degree. The full bench comprises all the IHC judges, except Justice Jahangiri himself. Headed by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, the bench also includes Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Babar Sattar, Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz. Over two months ago, a letter began circulating on social media, purportedly from the KU’s controller of examinations, regarding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree. A reference against the judge had also been filed in the Supreme Judicial Council. On July 8, the IHC stepped in to counter the drive against the judge, with its full bench issuing notices to journalists Hassan Ayub Khan and Gharida Farooqui, as well as social media activist Ammar Solangi. The three individuals had shared a letter and an annexure from the KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act 2016 about the degree.      The IHC had also issued notices to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). The court had directed them to identify the individuals involved in the malicious campaign and submit their responses within four weeks. The hearing had been adjourned till the end of summer vacations. On Saturday, KU’s syndicate, on the recommendation of its Unfair Means (UFM) Committee, cancelled the degree and enrolment of a candidate, who was said to be Justice Jahangiri. The decision came after hours-long detention of academic and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed. Ahmed alleged the move was an attempt to stop him from attending the syndicate’s key meeting where he said an IHC judge’s degree was to be discussed. Eluding from acknowledging the detention on Saturday, the police said a day later Ahmed was arrested over a 2017 case but let go after confusion was cleared. The letter from KU stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name of Tariq Jahangiri. Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme. Justice Jahangiri is among the six IHC judges who previously complained to the SJC about their chief justice and accused the Inter-Services Intelligence of interfering in judicial affairs. The complaint included allegations of spy cameras being detected at the entrance and in the bedroom of a judge, a matter that was reportedly conveyed to the chief justice but to no avail. "

  "description": "Karachi police on Monday said they arrested a second suspect in connection with the gang rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl during an “encounter”. The body of a minor girl was found in a bag near a garbage dump in the city’s Lucky Star area on August 25. The autopsy had revealed that she was raped and strangled. Last week, the police had claimed to have arrested what it described as the prime suspect in the crime. “A highly wanted suspect was arrested in injured condition during a police encounter on Abdul Sattar Edhi Avenue in Defence’s Phase 8,” Deputy Inspector General (DIG)-South Syed Asad Raza said today. He did not specify whether the suspect was already wounded or injured during the pursuit. Noting that the suspect, Asim Ali, was wanted in the case of “rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl”, DIG Raza said he had “thrown her body near Lucky Star” after committing the crime. “An accomplice of the suspect is already in custody,” the DIG said, referring to the arrest made last week. The case had been registered at the Saddar police station, Raza said. DIG Raza had previously described the man arrested last week as the prime suspect, who he said was a watchman at the Bara Market near Cantonment Railway Station. However, his two accomplices, who worked at the Shalimar bus terminal, were still at large, the official had stated. DIG Raza also said that investigators had identified the victim as belonging to the Hindu community and living underneath the Lilly Bridge with her mother. He said that the girl and her mother had come from Sukkur around 20 days before the incident to look after an ailing relative. Her mother also fell ill and went to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for treatment on the night of August 24. She returned to the bridge at around 2am but could not find her daughter.      Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had taken notice of the case and ordered the police to arrest the culprits involved. According to Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed — who heads the team of medico-legal officers deputed in the city’s three major hospitals — 522 women and underage girls were sexually assaulted in Karachi alone during the year 2023. More than 4,040 cases of physical assault on women were reported in the same year, while 22 bodies were exhumed on court orders, she had said. Child abuse cases in country In March this year, data released by Sahil — an NGO working for the welfare of children — revealed that in 2023, a total of 4,213 child abuse cases had been reported from all four provinces as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). A gender-divide analysis of the data showed that out of the total reported cases, 2,251 (53 per cent) of victims were girls and 1,962 (47pc) were boys.      The reported age showed that children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 6-15 years, in which more cases of boys than girls were reported. Moreover, children as young as 0-5 years were also sexually abused. The abuser’s category indicated that acquaintances were still the most involved in child sexual abuse, along with relatives, family members, strangers, and women abettors. The geographical divide statistics show that out of the total 4,213 reported cases, 75pc were reported from Punjab, 13pc cases from Sindh, 7pc cases from Islamabad capital territory, 3pc cases from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and 2pc cases from Balochistan, AJK, and GB.

  "description": "Two policemen were injured in an ambush on a checkpost in Mianwali by more than a dozen Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists — branded as kharijis (outcasts) by the government — late on Sunday night, according to a statement issued by the Punjab police today. The spokesperson for the Punjab police said that the attack was repelled successfully, but the attackers escaped. “Around 12-14 Khawariji terrorists took advantage of the darkness of the night to attack the Qubal Khel checkpost with rocket launchers and hand grenades,” the spokesman said. In late July, the government declared TTP as Fitna al-Khawarij and all other terrorists associated with the group as khariji (outcasts). The spokesperson said that the Punjab police personnel posted at the check post were “on alert” and, as a result, foiled the attack. Mianwali DPO Akhtar Farooq, upon his visit of the checkpost, congratulated the personnel for derailing the ambush. “The search operation is going on in the area, and there is a possibility of causing heavy loss to the fugitive terrorists,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, IG Punjab Dr Usman Anwar commended DPO Mianwali and the police personnel deployed at the checkpost for thwarting the attack. He said that it was the ninth terrorist attack on the Punjab Police over the last few months that was thwarted. “There is a lead hardened wall against terrorists at the interprovincial border posts,” he said, vowing that the police “will crush the evil intentions of the enemy in the future too”.

  "description": "KHYBER: The ongoing blockade of the main Torkham highway by Kukikhel protesters has largely ‘spoiled’ the peak import season from Afghanistan and so far has caused a whopping monetary loss of approximately Rs540 million to national exchequer on a daily basis since August 21. Sources at Torkham told Dawn that exports of all types to Afghanistan too were completely halted that were additionally inflicting losses on local traders and manufacturers to the tune of $2.5 million on daily basis with no immediate solution to the return of Kukikhel displaced families and reopening of the road. They said that those figures were obtained by customs authorities some three months ago and the amount on a daily basis might have increased with a rise in the quantum of bilateral trade during the current ‘peak season’. Importers at Torkham told this scribe that August and September were considered ‘ideal’ and profitable months for import of fresh fruits and vegetables alongside soapstone and coal, which earned the custom authorities a handsome amount in terms of import duty on a daily basis.  Stranded drivers say they are suffering from mental and physical stress  “This is the peak season for import of fresh Afghan fruits like apple, apricot, grapes and watermelon along with fresh vegetables including onion and tomato added by dry fruits of various types,” said Mujeebullah, a custom clearing agent. He said that 300 to 400 vehicles loaded with those items would come from Afghanistan on a daily basis out of which more than 500 were now stuck on the Pakistan side of the road, mostly in Landi Kotal owing to closure of the road by the Kukikhel protesters. He said that Pakistan during the same period of the year would send 200 to 300 loaded vehicles of cement, aluminum sheets for manufacturing of cans and bottles in Afghanistan, building material, furniture items, medicines, mineral water and cool drinks of various types along with banana, mangoes and peaches to different parts of Afghanistan on a daily basis. Mujeebullah said that the most lucrative season of both imports and exports from and to Afghanistan via Torkham border was lost due to the sudden closure of the main highway by Kukikhel tribesmen while traders and transporters incurred losses to the tune of millions of rupees along with a huge loss to national exchequer. Local importers and exporters had long been demanding a hindrance-free bilateral trade with Afghanistan with special focus on provision of better facilities to them at the time of goods clearance and removing traffic congestion at Torkham border for a swift cross-border movement by loaded vehicles. Meanwhile, drivers stranded on the main highway complained about the hardships they were confronted with owing to closure of road since August 21. Said Rasool, an Afghan driver who had soapstone loaded on his vehicle, told Dawn that most of them were running short of money as they had already exhausted their ‘pocket money’ they were carrying with them because they had to bear additional expenses on food and other daily use items during the 12-day closure of road. He said that most of the drivers and their assistants had to stay close to their loaded vehicles for fear of theft or any act of sabotage. “Days are frustrating and nights are mostly sleepless as we have to spend our whole time on the road beneath our vehicles while a majority of drivers are now suffering from mental and physical stress,” he said. Groups of local young volunteers, mostly Noujawan-i-Qabayal activists, have been providing free food and drinking water to the stranded drivers. Kukikhel protesters have in the meantime allowed ‘small vehicles’ to run between Peshawar and Landi Kotal while using a dirt road along Bhagiyarree checkpost where they have established their protest camp. The relaxation for small vehicles have eased movement of locals and also paves way for carrying essential daily use items including edibles to Landi Kotal and surrounding localities. The protesters, however, remained adamant about the reopening of the road as they still insisted on the immediate return of all the remaining Kukikhel IDPs to Tirah with an adequate compensation on the pattern of Swat and Waziristan returned families.

  "description": "SARGODHA: The Kot Momin police have arrested a landlord for abducting and killing his young employee on suspicion of theft. The police arrested the suspect after the body of Mazhar was found in a sugarcane field. The police said suspect Aamir confessed to kidnapping and killing Mazhar on Aug 24. The incident came to light after Muhammad Aslam, a close relative of the deceased, filed a complaint with the police on Aug 30 that Mazhar had quit his job after not receiving his salary from Aamir and did not return to work despite repeated requests from the landlord. The police investigation revealed that Aamir had allegedly abducted Mazhar and was seen torturing him on Aug 24. On Aug 30, police received information about human remains found in the field. Locals informed the police that Mazhar had been missing for some time and that the remains might belong to him.      The police arrested Aamir who said he suspected Mazhar of stealing valuable belongings from him and, in a fit of anger, tortured him to death. He then disposed of the body in a sugarcane field. The police shifted the body to the hospital for a post-mortem examination. The case against Aamir has now been amended to include charges of murder. Separately, Shehbaz was killed by armed men over an enmity. The police registered a murder case against six people and handed over the body to the victim’s family after a post-mortem. The suspects fled the scene after the shooting. Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2024 "

  "description": "LAHORE: Punjab police hierarchy has expressed strong reservations over the establishment of a proposed body with “overarching” powers parallel to the traditional policing system and having politicians’ role in the authority, a top official has confirmed. Dawn reported last week that the Punjab government is planning to set up a provincial authority under the Punjab Enforcement and Regul­ation Act (Pera) 2024 to oversee the enforcement of special laws relating to price control, hoarding and land management.      As per the draft bill, which is yet to be approved by the assembly, the body will have the mandate to enforce three laws — The Colonisation of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912; The Punjab Prevention of Hoarding Act, 2020; and The Punjab Price Control of Essential Commodities Act, 2024. Structure The 18-member body — 10 senior bureaucrats, four Punjab Assembly members including the chief minister, and as many independent members — will also have separate “enforcement stations” parallel to traditional police stations. Its officers will have the power to conduct inspections, patrol and search any person or vehicle, seize articles and goods and make arrests — all core functions of police.  Top cops complain of being kept in dark  According to an official privy to the latest development, Punjab IGP Dr Usman Anwar in an urgent meeting with Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman protested over not taking his department into confidence on the matter. Officials said IGP Anwar strongly opposed the idea of raising a new force comprising 7,000 personnel for the proposed authority and posting them in the 40 notified districts of the Punjab police. As per the official, the police high-ups have been told that the brain behind the proposed authority was Punjab Planning and Development Board Chairman Nabeel Ahmad Awan. When contacted, the IGP confirmed his meeting with the chief secretary. Several loopholes The police department has prepared a detailed presentation outlining several loopholes in the proposed law for the provincial government’s consideration. IGP Anwar also pointed out a set of flaws and anomalies in the proposed law and the potential challenges it will create. These issues were mostly related to technical faults in enforcing the laws, improper accountability mechanisms, political interference, potential shortcomings on the administrative and judicial sides and huge expenditures on specialised prosecutors, courts and skilled staff. The police hierarchy questioned the composition of the authority — with an overwhelming presence of bureaucrats — which had no officer of the Police Service of Pakistan. The role of police was missing even in the district enforcement and regulatory board, according to them.      As a reference, the police official said, a SSP-ranked officer was appointed as the director-general of Anti-Encroachment Force Sindh under the Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010. Not only that, all members of the force were from the Sindh police department. The police pointed out that “powerful segments” are invovled in all scheduled offences such as encroachment, public nuisance, price control, hoarding, etc., and any action against them carries a certain risk of resistance, strike, and a law and order situation during and after the operations. “An armed and uniformed enforcement squad with the power to arrest and lodge FIR without power to deal with the criminal force used against them in the discharge of their duty will render them useless and more susceptible to resistance, mob attacks and further weaken the writ of state,” reads the presentation. The police force fears that it will have to deal with the “unforeseen risks” if a law and order situation is created after an action by the officers of the proposed body. “Such actions by the agency, in the absence of Punjab police, will open a gateway of complaints to police regarding high handedness by the enforcement squad,” said the official, while quoting the report. This will “further complicate” the police work. To avoid such a situation, the Punjab police will have to be mobilised with the enforcement squad for every operation, making the whole exercise of forming a specialised force redundant. The recruitment, training, equipment, logistics (vehicles including prison vans), offices, specialised buildings with lockups, data management system, etc. will have huge associated costs and take several months, even years, to start working efficiently, the presentation said. While speaking to Dawn, Mr Awan fully defended the proposed authority and rejected the police claim, pointing out that it would not be the first law enforcement agency operating in the province. He said counter-terrorism department, anti-corruption and some other departments were also enjoying same powers of registering FIR, arresting suspects and investigating them to take them to the court of law. The Punjab police in fact assist these departments or agencies, if and when required, he added. Mr Awan said the newly proposed authority would deal with some 10 offences and none would be related to street crime. “I don’t know why the police hierarchy was opposing the authority,” he added. He suggested the police focus on street crime, which was their prime domain to provide relief to citizens rather than opposing the proposed authority. Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2024 "

  "description": "NAROWAL: A suspect was allegedly killed by torture in custody of the Shah Gharib Police Station while police claimed that he had committed suicide and registered a case against two officials for negligence. Muhammad Farooq, son of Mushtaq Ahmed, a resident of village Kadiala, was in custody of the police on charge of motorcycle theft. On Sunday morning, Farooq was found dead in the lock-up. His family alleged that he was in the custody of police for the last many days and that police tortured him to death during interrogation. They rejected the police claims of suicide. Ghulam Mustafa, the spokesperson for the district police, said the suspect was arrested by police in theft cases. He claimed that during interrogation, Farooq had confessed to stealing 11 motorcycles and police recovered four motorcycles from him while seven motorcycles were yet to be recovered from him. The spokesman added that after the Fajr prayers, a constable checked the lock-up and found Farooq had committed suicide by tying a noose around his neck.  Two officials booked over negligence  District Police Officer Muhammad Naveed Malik took notice of the death of the suspect in the police lock-up and sought forensic analysis. He wrote a letter for a judicial inquiry into the incident.      Farooq’s family appealed to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar to take immediate notice of the situation. In the late night development, a FIR was registered over the death of a motorcycle thief in the lock-up. The report was registered on the complaint of DSP/SDPO Shakargarh Shehbaz Cheema. He said CCTV footage from the police station showed Farooq putting a noose around his neck and hanging himself by the door of the washroom. He added that the suspect committed suicide due to the negligence of moharar Muhammad Imran and constable Qadeer Ahmed and a case was registered against them with Shah Gharib Police Station.

  "description": "QUETTA / RAWALPINDI: At least five people lost their lives in different parts of Balochistan as heavy monsoon rains continued to batter the province on Sunday, with the Pakistan Meteorological Depar­t­ment (PMD) warning of more rain and landslides in several parts of the country. Meanwhile, the cyclonic storm Asna has moved further south-westwards over the past 12 hours, weakening into a deep depression. The system is currently located around 320km northeast of Masirah Island in Oman, 340km east-southeast of that country’s capital Muscat, and 370km south of Gwadar. Officials said the northern districts of Balochistan, including Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Harnai and Qila Saifullah, have been particularly hard hit, with torrential rains destroying homes and displacing hundreds as their mud houses were swept away by the floods. “The link roads in these districts have been washed away by flash floods, cutting off all road connections with the provincial capital, Quetta,” a senior official from one of the affected districts told Dawn.  Met Office forecasts more rains across country; Cyclone Asna weakens  Tragedy struck on the Sibi-Harnai road, where a couple was found dead after their car was swept away by flash floods while attempting to cross the seasonal Beeji streams. Their bodies were later recovered by residents. The man was identified as Muhammad Ibrahim Khajak, an employee of the livestock department.      In Zhob, a child drowned, while two more deaths were reported in the flood-hit areas of Harnai and Qila Saifullah within the last 24 hours. The situation in Jhal Magsi remained critical, with over a dozen villages submerged in floodwaters. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the lack of road access to the stranded families. Moreover, a large breach occurred in the Rabi canal in Nasirabad district, causing floodwaters to inundate several villages and wash away link roads. The Regional Meteorological Centre in Quetta has forecasted rain and thundershowers across several districts, including Quetta, Zhob, Sibi and Sherani, from Monday (today) to Wednesday, with occasional gaps. Sea conditions are likely to remain rough to very rough, with stormy winds of 40-50 km/h, gusting up to 60 km/h until Sunday night. Fishermen in Balochistan have been advised to avoid venturing into the open sea until Monday. Upper parts and Punjab The PMD has also predicted rain and thundershowers in the upper parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Islam­abad, Murree, Galyat and Lahore, from Monday and Tuesday. A moist current from the Bay of Bengal is expected to penetrate these regions, with a westerly wave likely to approach the western parts of the country in the evening today. Wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are also anticipated in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra and Abbottabad, on Monday and Tuesday. Sindh Rain, wind and thundershowers are also expected in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, Dadu, Jacobabad, Karachi, Hyder­abad, Thatta, Badin, Tando Allahyar, etc, on Tuesday and Wednesday.

  "description": "LONDON: Amidst the largely glowing press reports PTI founder Imran Khan has received in the British press for his application to the chancellorship position at Oxford University, a column published in the Observer this weekend criticised the incarcerated former prime minister in a detailed article. Columnist Catherine Bennett, who frequently writes on politics and culture, said Mr Khan’s controversial views and actions make him an unsuitable candidate for such a prestigious position, which would involve representing Oxford’s values globally. Ms Bennett writes that Mr Khan once referred to Osama bin Laden as a “martyr” and praised the Taliban for “breaking the shackles of slavery”. Ms Bennett points out that Mr Khan has even excused the Taliban’s ban on women’s education and holds regressive views on rape, suggesting that women should avoid being a “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower.”  Observer column states his candidacy would be insult to women, against Oxford values  She further criticises Mr Khan’s apparent admiration for the Chinese Communist Party, particularly its treatment of Uyghur Muslims, which he once praised as an alternative model that outperforms Western democracies. This stance, she argues, aligns poorly with Oxford’s tradition of defending free speech and human rights. The opinion piece also contrasts Mr Khan with another candidate for the chancellorship, Lady Elish Angiolini, who is presented as a more suitable choice. Ms Angiolini’s background as a lawyer, her efforts to make Oxford more accessible to poorer students, and her leadership in significant public inquiries are highlighted as making her a more fitting candidate.      Referring to Ms Angiolini, Ms Bennett writes, “In short, it is hard to conceive of a person whose chancellorship would be less pleasing to the Taliban and its apologists. If only his supporters could say the same for Mr Khan.” The article comes amidst a media blitz in the British press on Mr Khan’s application and his chances. Several British MPs, including Conservative peer Lord Daniel Hannan and independent MPs Shockat Adam and Adnan Hussain too endorsed Mr Khan for the position. However, an associate professor at Oxford told Dawn last week that Mr Khan’s chances at winning are slim, and it is unlikely he will garner a large number of votes. “But I suspect the PTI is not necessarily interested in winning; they want to make an issue out of this, and they have succeeded,” Adeel Malik said.

  "description": "QUETTA / LAHORE: One person was killed and four others were injured in bomb blasts in Quetta and Bajaur on Sunday. On the same day, Balochistan Chief Mini­ster Sarfraz Bagti denied any operation was going on in the province and ruled out talks with anyone who “doesn’t respect the Constitution”. According to officials, the blast in Quetta took place close to a Frontier Corps checkpoint near the Chaman railway crossing gate, a high-security area. A senior police officer said an improvised explosive device (IED) was planted at the back wall of the checkpoint, which exploded with a loud bang. A man and his son, who were passing through the area, were injured in the incident. Police and Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment officials moved the injured to Civil Hospital, where their condition is said to be stable, according to Dr Wasim Baig, the hospital’s spokesman.  CM Bugti denies operation in Balochistan, rules out talks outside constitutional framework  They have been identified as Haji Ghulam Rasool and his son Muhammad Osama.      The blast damaged a car, two rickshaws and several motorcycles. The windowpanes of nearby buildings and houses were smashed due to the impact of the blast. The FC personnel posted at the checkpoint remained safe. According to the bomb disposal squad, a device with 0.5kg of explosives was connected to a timer. Investigators are reviewing footage of nearby surveillance cameras installed in the area. No group claimed responsibility for the blast.    BALOCHISTAN Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti addresses a press conference in Lahore.—APP  One killed in Bajaur In Bajaur district, one person was killed and two others were injured when an IED went off in Salarzai tehsil, officials said. Police, Rescue 1122 officials and locals said the blast took place near Dara bazar, located some 28km northeast of Khar, the district headquarters. A senior police official, who visited the explosion site, told Dawn that the victims were all pedestrians. A statement issued by Rescue 1122 said three people were critically injured in the attack, one of whom died while being shifted to the Khar district hospital. The deceased was identified as 28-year-old Rahimullah, while the injured included 25-year-old Fazal Hadi and 29-year-old Muhibullah. They are said to be in a critical condition. According to the police, the deceased and injured were relatives and belong to the Bai China area of Khar tehsil. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack till the filing of this report. In a statement, Bajaur police said a case has been registered and an investigation launched into the attack. No operation in Balochistan CM Bugti, who was in Lahore, told a press conference that he would not negotiate with those who killed innocent people. “One can negotiate with those who believe in the Constitution within the constitutional framework.” Denying that any operation was going on in Balochistan, he said efforts were being made through social media to encourage the youth to rebel against the state.      CM Bugti said those who dismounted passengers belonging to Punjab from buses and killed them should not be called “angry Balochs”. His remarks came days after militants shot dead 23 people after checking their identity documents in Musakhail, a district on the Balochistan-Punjab border. “The militants who made innocent citizens belonging to Punjab get off the buses and then killed them are terrorists, and they should not be called angry Baloch,” Mr Bugti said. “No Baloch killed a Punjabi, but terrorists killed Pakistanis.” The chief minister said the state would stand with the oppressed irrespective of nationalism. “The terrorists killed Pakistanis. Our hearts are with the heirs of the martyrs,” he said and vowed to bring to justice the “sympathisers and facilitators of terrorists”. Mr Bugti claimed that the unrest in Balochistan was being funded by Indian intelligence agency RAW and the government has solid evidence to prove the claim. “In the name of nationalism, these terrorists want to weaken Pakistan.” He said there was a systematic conspiracy “to weaken Pakistan”. In Balochistan, common people and labourers are soft targets. They are killed by terrorists as they “don’t have the capacity to hit hard targets”. Mr Bugti also thanked the prime minister and army chief who visited Quetta last week and attended the Apex Committee meeting. Condolences In Lahore, CM Bugti visited the residence of Captain Muhammad Ali Qureshi, who embraced martyrdom in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan last week, APP reported. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Quetta Corps Commander Lt Gen Rahat Naseem accompanied the chief minister. They met the martyred soldier’s parents and expressed condolences to the family. They also paid tribute to the sacrifice of Captain Qureshi. Mr Naqvi said the soldier bravely fought with terrorists and foiled their nefarious designs. CM Bugti called the martyred captain “a brave son of soil” while Lt Gen Naseem said his sacrifice was “a symbol of unflinching resolve of Pakistan Army and people against terrorism”. Later, they visited the grave of the martyred captain, laid floral wreaths and offered fateha. Anwarullah Khan in Bajaur also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2024 "

  "description": "• Gohar denies seeking ‘favour’ from govt • Raoof says govt ‘desperate’ to extend CJP’s tenure • PPP’s Gilani asks PM to lead dialogue with all parties • Khawaja Asif claims Nawaz Sharif did not speak about reaching out to PTI ISLAMABAD: A day after former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif suggested an across-the-board dialogue to pull the country out of crises, the PTI, the major opposition party, ruled out a possibility of direct talks with PML-N and favoured negotiations with the establishment instead. In an interview with Voice of America on Sunday, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said the deadlock between the army and the PTI needed to be ended and that the former ruling party was interested in talking to the powers that be in this regard. According to the PTI leader, who was recently released from jail in a cybercrime case, a dialogue between the PTI and the establishment was imperative for the sake of the state’s interests. He reiterated that PTI wanted to end this deadlock. The PTI spokesperson said his party had done whatever it could to improve ties with the army, but underscored that any talks in this regard would be within the ambit of the Constitution.     In response to a question regarding Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s statement about his contacts with the establishment, the PTI leader said some party leaders might have “individual” relationship with the powers that be and the postponement of the Aug 22 did show that there was some sort of contact. He told VoA that Imran Khan had nominated some people for talks with the army and if there was any sort of exchange they would take that forward. The PTI leader, however, mentioned that any sort of negotiations with the powerful quarters would have to be in the ambit of the Constitution, adding that if all state institutions worked according to their constitutional jurisdiction that would end instability in the country.      In response to a question regarding talks with the coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PTI spokesperson questioned the legitimacy of the ‘Form 47’ government, saying talking to the government would not serve any purpose as the incumbent rulers came to power through rigging in the Feb 8 elections. He also alleged that the government was “desperate” to extend the tenure of Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and that was why it was planning to bring judicial reforms. Mr Hasan also talked about the party’s Sept 8 gathering in Islamabad, claiming that after this public meeting there would be a visible increase in the frequency of such meetings by the PTI. On the other hand, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said PTI had not offered negotiations to the government or sought any favour from it. He said Imran Khan had already authorised Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Aaeen-i-Pakistan chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to hold talks with the government. In reply to a question regarding his meeting with NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Barrister Gohar said there was no discussion on the possible dialogue bet­ween the government and the opposition. Nawaz’s offer The snub to indirect talks offer came in response to a proposal by Nawaz Sharif on Saturday wherein he sought the engagement of all stakeholders, including the army and the judiciary, as well as the political parties to find a solution to the crises, particularly the economic crunch. A statement issued by the PML-N after the meeting quoted the elder Sharif as saying: “All political parties, governments, and institutions should join hands in decision-making. [They] …need to sit together to steer the country out of crises.”      However, senior PML-N leader Khawaja Asif while talking during a Geo News programme on Sunday claimed that Saturday’s meeting of the party did not discuss any political issues. He said Nawaz Sharif did not speak about reaching out to PTI. He further said that atmosphere for any such negotiations was not conducive. It may be recalled that the PML-N’s statement, issued after the party’s meeting in Lahore on Saturday, followed a meeting between Mr Achakzai and PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah and gave rise to speculations that the government was interested in seeking a dialogue with the PTI. Rana Sanaullah, however, rejected the impression, saying he had met the PkMAP chief to take him on board in light of his past relationship with the PML-N, even during difficult times. The meeting had nothing to do with the PTI, he had added. Similarly, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal also rejected the idea of talks with the PTI, linking any sort of dialogue with an apology from the PTI regarding the May 9 events. PPP asks Shehbaz to lead talks Separately, Senate Chairman and PPP leader Yousuf Raza Gilani told the media that his party would support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in addressing national issues. While emphasising the need for national unity during challenging times, the PPP leader called for dialogue among all political parties, including the PTI, urging the PM to lead the talks and make decisions. “Shehbaz Sharif is the captain of the team and must take the necessary decisions. If he makes any decision, we will support him on national issues,” he stated. Replying to a question about the meetings with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam chief Fazlur Rehman, he said the JUI-F leader was a wise political leader and would take decisions in favour of the country.

  "content": "A bill seeking an amendment to the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act, 1997, was tabled in the Senate on Monday, to increase the number of top court judges to 20 sans the chief justice in order to clear the backlog of cases. The bill titled \"Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act\", 2024, was presented by an independent senator from Balochistan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir. He sought the increase in the number of top court judges from 17 to 21 as \"more than 53,000 cases\" pending in the apex court. According to the bill, a copy of which is available with Geo News, the number of judges of the top court other than the chief justice shall be 20. It further stated: \"The Supreme Court has four jurisdictions original, appellate, advisory, and review being diverse and demanding, contributing to the continuous accumulation of cases.\" \"With economic growth and social changes, the complexity and variety of cases have increase,\" it pointed out. It stressed: \"This backlog, combined with the complexities of integrating the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, necessitates more judicial resources.\" Speaking on the floor of the upper house, Senator Abdul Qadir called for appointing \"at least 16 judges\" to the top court, saying that several constitutional matters were being referred to the top court. \"Larger benches are formed and these judges look into the constitutional matters,\" he added. Not only constitutional cases, but several cases related to financial matters worth billions were also pending in the top court as it does not have time to hear these cases, the senator claimed. \"Our judicial system is lowest on the [global] ranking,\" he added. However, the opposition senators opposed the new legislation. Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar also backed the legislation and suggested forwarding the new bill to the relevant committee. Tarar, while addressing the Senate session, endorsed the points raised by Senator Qadir, saying several cases pertaining to capital punishments still awaiting verdicts since 2015. \"A person spent 34 years in jail due to a pending appeal before the top court,\" he added. Tarar further said that the architects of the Constitution of Pakistan have not fixed a specific number of judges and gave parliament power to determine the judicial strength. It is noteworthy to mention here that in a bid to reduce pendency of the cases, two retired judges — Justice (retd) Tariq Masood and Justice (retd) Mazhar Alam Miankhel — had been appointed as ad hoc judges to the apex court for a period of one year in July. The appointment of the retired jurists was recommended by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) two months ago which was later approved by President Asif Ali Zardari under Article 182 of the Constitution. In his remarks on the amendment, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Syed Ali Zafar said that the law was “suddenly tabled” in the the upper house to increase the number of jurists. He termed the amendments \"an attempt to impose a judicial martial law\" by bringing seven new judges. Zafar added that his party was ready to approve the appointment of two more judges. The senator suggested the government to start increasing the judicial strength from subordinate courts instead of the Supreme Court. He also alleged that Senator Qadir \"is being used\" for the new legislation which he said apparently going in favour of the coalition government. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told journalists earlier today that the party has decided to oppose any amendment bill regarding the judiciary and all their members of parliament have been officially notified about it. \"None of our MNA or senator will vote in the favour of the proposed amendments. Every MNA has been individually instructed in this regard in the light of Article 63 of the Constitution,\" Gohar said. Responding to the PTI’s opposition to the bill, Tarar in today's session said the former ruling party is worried over the proposed amendment as the bill would seize something, asking the opposition party to give logical reasons behind its apprehensions.  \"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) had sought an increase of 10 judges. The PTI is the ruling party there but we are still making the required appointments,\" he added. Taking part in the debate over the new legislation in the upper house of the parliament, Senator Aimal Wali Khan, the president of the Awami National Party (ANP), admitted that a judge cannot hear dozens of cases in a day. Expressing his concerns, Aimal questioned why the government is cherished over the opposition’s bill amid media reports questioning the requirements of additional judges. He was referring to the tabling of the said amendment by an independent senator instead of a government legislator. He also questioned the law minister regarding his pledge to introduce a bill on comprehensive legal reforms. He was of the view that the amendments related to increasing the number of judges could be included in the promised bill. The ANP president recommended the constitution of a separate court for constitutional amendments. Responding to Aimal's query, the law minister said that the federal government will introduce detailed reforms for subordinate courts in the coming days. Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred the bill to the relevant body of the upper house. The coalition government ruled by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has been facing criticism from the opposition parties for planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in the parliament. The Imran-founded party alleged that the recommended legislation could include the extension of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and changes in law regarding the appointments of SC judges based on the principle of seniority. However, the Centre has time and again denied these reports, saying that nothing as such was on the cards as CJP Isa has \"no interest\" in getting an extension. Refuting speculations on the seniority-based law for CJP’s appointment, Law Minister Tarar had said that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new top judge is \"seniority\"."

  "content": "Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar has ruled out the possibility of an extension in Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa's tenure as the top judge while responding to the speculations centred on his imminent retirement.  CJP Isa is set to retire in October this year, but as his retirement draws near, rumours of an \"extension\" in his tenure through judiciary-centric legislation in parliament have been rife. However, the Centre has time and again denied these reports, saying that nothing as such was on the cards as CJP Isa has \"no interest\" in getting an extension. The legal experts say there is no constitutional mechanism for such an extension without amendments to the Constitution. Even if the government wants such an amendment, it would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, which is a challenge in the light of recent Supreme Court verdict on reserved seats favouring Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). \"The two-thirds majority should be discussed when an extension has to be granted,\" Tarar said while addressing an event in Islamabad.  He said that the chief justice \"clearly told me and the attorney general that he doesn't want an extension\". The minister said that CJP Qazi Faez Isa is a respectable person and it was not appropriate to repeatedly say that he is seeking an extension. \"I request the media persons to talk about some other topic as it was unnecessary to discuss the top judge's extension repeatedly,\" he added. As stated earlier by the law minister, the principle of seniority will be followed in the appointment of a new top judge of the country. Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah is next in line to become the country's top judge. The speculations about CJP Isa's extension gained attraction after the PTI sought an early issuance of notification regarding the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), last month. While speaking to the media today, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that the party has decided to oppose any amendment bill regarding the judiciary and all their members of parliament have been officially notified about it. \"None of our MNA or senator will vote in the favour of the proposed amendments. Every MNA has been individually instructed in this regard in the light of Article 63 of the Constitution,\" Gohar said. It may be noted that the controversial apex court judgment of July 2022 on former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi's petition prevents lawmakers from defying party lines in constitutional votes, effectively limiting the government’s ability to secure additional votes through defections. Moreover, speaking about the matter of parleys between the opposition and the government, the PTI chairman said that a dialogue should be held. The PTI chief said his party has also clarified with whom the talks should be held.  \"PTI founder has given the mandate to hold the talks with political parties to Mahmood Achakzai and it is his prerogative to decide the point which should be talked on,\" he added. Gohar further stated that if the party will consider any suggestions presented by the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman. "

  "content": "Mobile phone SIMs of users who have not yet renewed their expired Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) will be suspended by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). According to a statement by the authority issued on Monday, SIMs of users whose cards have expired before 2017 will be suspended. The statement comes as the PTA begins the second phase of its operation against the use of illegal SIMs across the country. \"Those whose ID cards have expired before 2017 and have not been renewed, their SIMs will be suspended.\" The authority has urged users to get their identity cards renewed to avoid getting their SIMs blocked. It should be noted that the PTA blocked fake SIMs and cancelled CNICs of citizens in the first phase after initiating the operation. \"Since August 16, more than 69,000 illegal SIMs have been blocked,\" the statement read, adding that the illegal SIMs are being blocked on the basis of data obtained from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra). Meanwhile, the authority will terminate SIMs registered in the names of deceased persons during the third phase. Before the blocking of mobile SIMs, awareness messages were sent to users, asking them to update relevant data. The statement by the PTA maintained that fake SIMs are being used in various illegal activities including terrorism, financial fraud and other activities. In the last three and a half years, the authority has blocked more than 363,000 URLs in the category of illegal content. From January 2021 to June 2024, the category of defamatory or impersonating content had the lowest blocking rate. Social media platforms blocked 307,610 of these URLs. The overall blocking rate is 84.72%. The PTA is taking action on 2,480 URLs related to contempt of court. Social media platforms blocked 1,496 of them. The blocking rate is 60.32%. The rate of blocking content against security and defence is slightly higher. The PTA examined 10,1682 URLs, of which 74,224 were blocked, thus a blocking rate of 73%. It took action over 6,853 URLs in the miscellaneous content category and social media platforms and blocked 5,621 of them. The rate of blocking content against the glory of Islam was also high, where the action was taken on 46,103 URLs and 37,479 were blocked. 34,673 URLs were examined and 28,922 were blocked for sectarianism and hate speech content. The highest blocking rate was seen in the unethical category, where 158,054 URLs were examined and 152,646 blocked. It has a content blocking rate of 96.46%, with all 51 URLs related to proxy content blocked."

  "content": "MIANWALI: Two policemen were injured in an attack on a checkpost in Punjab's Mianwali by more than a dozen terrorists, Geo News reported Monday.  About 12 to 14 khawarij attacked the Qabool Khel police check post with rockets and hand grenades, according to the police spokesperson.  However, Punjab Police thwarted the attack by terrorists after which they escaped, said the spokesperson, adding that two cops were injured as a result. Following the incident, district police officer of Mianwali, Deputy Superintendent of Police Isa Khel reached the check post along with heavy personnel. Last month, at least 12 policemen were martyred and six sustained injuries after bandits attacked their vans with rockets in a riverine area of Punjab's Rahim Yar Khan. The horrific attack occurred in the Machka area located in one of Rahim Yar Khan's riverine areas. Police officials told the media that two police vans with more than 20 cops were trapped in rainwater in the locality when bandits launched rockets at them. As a result of the fierce attack, a dozen cops were martyred while seven others were wounded and five went missing, the police added. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Defence Khawaja Asif refuted media reports about a PML-N meeting in which Nawaz Sharif reportedly directed his party to hold talks with all political parties, including the PTI, to salvage the country from the prevailing crises.  \"Nawaz Sharif did not even discuss politics at the meeting, let alone offer an olive branch to the opposition party,\" Asif said during the Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ on Sunday. He said that neither any such discussion took place in the meeting nor the PML-N president gave instructions in this regard. \"We concentrated on two topics only during the meeting, one on holding local bodies elections in Punjab and the other on bringing down electricity prices,\" he said. Asif also said that unless the PTI apologised for the May 9 violent incidents, there would be no room for progress in the negotiations with them. “Accountability of the May 9 incidents should be held 200%,” he said. He further maintained that the opposition party directly or indirectly expressing desire for negotiations was devoid of sincerity. The minister, while pointing towards PTI founder Imran Khan’s erratic behavior, said even PTI members did not trust Khan and lamented about his egoistic and opportunistic attitude. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he added, offered the PTI to hold talks multiple times. Khwaja Asif that the premier had even proposed the Imran Khan-founded party to sign a charter of economy. However, neither the PTI founder nor any of his ministers responded to the proposal, he revealed. \"The PTI founder (then PM) sat turning his back towards the opposition with arrogance,” he said, stressing how his camaraderie with former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed was on peak at the time. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said even as the premier, Shehbaz invited them for negotiations and a charter of economy. “Just few months ago, PM Shehbaz Sharif walked the floor of the National Assembly to their seats. He shook hands with the entire PTI leadership,” he said describing the prime minister’s amicable conduct with the opposition. PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui also endorsed Asif’s statement, saying that the party president Nawaz Sharif did not offer or invite the PTI for talks. “Nawaz Sharif has not approached anyone,” he said adding that the PML-N president did want that his party initiate dialogue with its political arch-rival. He further stated the statements of PTI leaders were usually devoid of truth. On the other hand, he said, the PTI kept insisting on holding talks with the establishment. Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan has \"hoped and prayed\" that the deadlock between the military and his party does not continue any longer, expressing willingness to talk with the latter. \"Our position has always been that we want to engage with them\", the PTI spokesperson said in an interview with Voice of America (VOA) on Sunday, noting that the party’s doors are open for dialogue with them. The PTI has long stated that it will only hold talks with those who wield real power in the country. However, the director general Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on May 7 demanded that \"those involved in the May 9 violent protests apologise\" and shun politics of “anarchy” before holding any dialogue. The May 9 incidents refer to the violent protests that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in a corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. \"In the interest of the state, it is imperative that PTI and the establishment engage in dialogue,\" he said, adding that the party had not left any stone unturned to \"end this stalemate\". However, Raoof clarified, that the talks would be held within the ambit of the Constitution. “Instability will end, once all institutions start working within the limits of the Constitution,” he added. The remarks came amid reports that the PML-N had purportedly approached Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai to broker talks with the PTI — a claim he confirmed as per The News. \"All the political leadership, including Nawaz Sharif, is on the same page about the Constitution, I have met Rana Sanaullah. There is no other way to take the country forward except through negotiations,\" Achakzai said during an informal conversation with journalists in Islamabad. However, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan rejected the reports and said his party hasn't offered any talks to the incumbent ruling party. \"The PTI neither offered to engage in talks [with the ruling party] nor sought any favours [from them],\" Barrister Gohar said while speaking to Geo News on Sunday. Earlier on July 31, the incarcerated PTI founder said that his party was ready to sit down with the military. Speaking to journalists in Adiala Jail, he said: \"We are ready to hold talks with the military. The army should nominate their representative [for negotiations].\" Khan reiterated that the incumbent government wanted to destroy his party by driving a wedge between the PTI and the armed forces."

  "content": "Humid winds from the Bay of Bengal are likely to enter upper areas of the country, resulting in heavy monsoon rains from today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said Monday, adding that the new system of rains will persist across the country until September 5. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a warning about potential heavy rains across the province, particularly today and tomorrow (Tuesday), which has raised concerns about the possibility of floods and landslides. In response to the forecasted weather conditions, district administrations are maintaining a high state of alert as a precautionary measure, according to the PDMA. Additionally, PMD Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz has forecasted moderate rainfall in northeastern Punjab and light rain in cities such as Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad today. Meanwhile, the PMD on Monday recorded the minimum temperature in Karachi at 25°C while the maximum temperature in the city is likely to fluctuate between 31°C to 33°C. The Met Office's forecast for Karachi shows a cloudy sky westward winds blowing at a light speed with 92% humidity. The forecast also shows the possibility of light rain or drizzle at night. According to the Met Office, the new system may also bring rain to some parts of Sindh, including Hyderabad, Thatta, Tharpakar, Mithi, and Badin, by tomorrow (Tuesday) while Karachi is likely to get light and heavy rain on September 4.  During an appearance on the Geo News programme show \"Geo Pakistan\", earlier today, Sardar said that the new system is also likely to bring heavy rains to northeastern Balochistan, which has already been devasted by the previous spell. He added that the intensity of heat may increase after September 7. The prediction of the new rain system comes after the country, especially parts of Sindh, experienced heavy rainfall and strong winds under the influence of cyclone Asna, which dissipated in the sea, without making landfall on any coast."

Eyewitnesses said the boys were \"jumping\" on the lid of the well when it suddenly broke under their weight, sending the victims, aged 8 and 12, crashing down to the bottom, where a submersible water pump was installed. In a panic, the residents called a local plumber to go down the well and rescue the children, but tragically, he met the same fate when the rope he was hanging onto snapped, according to the residents.   As soon as the authorities were alerted on the matter, rescuers were dispatched to the spot. The rescue teams told Geo News that they faced difficulty in pulling the children out of the well because it was very narrow.  Both the children, identified as Badar and Talha, and the plumber were pulled out in critical condition and were later declared dead. They said that one of their workers also got stuck inside the well but he was later pulled out safely.  Speaking to Geo News, the residents said that when the plumber stepped into the well, he told them about the \"lack of oxygen\" inside.  \"He tied both children to his body with a rope and asked us to pull it up, but it broke,\" they said."

  "content": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday categorically rejected Indian Minister for External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar's remarks on Jammu and Kashmir, terming them \"misleading\" and \"dangerously delusional\". On Friday, Jaishankar said that the era of \"uninterrupted dialogue\" with Pakistan is over while saying that New Delhi will respond to developments \"whether positive or negative\".  \"So far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, Article 370 is done. The issue [now] is what kind of relationship we can contemplate with Pakistan,\" the Indian media quoted him as saying at a private event.  In her response, FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch unequivocally rejected \"any narrative that suggests that the dispute has been or can be settled unilaterally\".  \"The Jammu and Kashmir dispute is internationally recognised and must be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people. Resolution of this unresolved conflict is pivotal to peace and stability in South Asia,\" Baloch said in a statement.  She said that such claims were not only \"misleading but dangerously delusional, as they blatantly disregard the on-ground realities\".  \"India’s unilateral actions in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) cannot and will not change this reality,” she added. The spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to diplomacy and dialogue but warned that any hostile actions would be met with \"unyielding resolve\". She urged India to abandon its \"provocative rhetoric\" about the Indian occupied territory, and to instead engage in a meaningful dialogue for a just and lasting resolution to the dispute. The statement stressed that true peace and stability in South Asia can only be achieved through a settlement in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the inalienable rights of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan downgraded its ties with India after the Modi-led government unilaterally changed the special status of the IIOJK in August 2019 — the decision that Islamabad believed undermined the environment for holding talks between the neighbours. Islamabad has linked its decision to normalising ties with New Delhi with the restoration of the special status of the IIOJK. Despite the frosty ties, the two countries agreed to renew the 2003 ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) in February 2021."

  "content": "Ruling out talks with terrorists who carried out Aug 26 deadly attacks that claimed over 50 lives in Balochistan, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti vowed on Sunday that the government would certainly chase the terrorists and wipe them out. \"It was not a 'Baloch' individual who killed a Punjabi, but the 'terrorists' who targeted Pakistanis. They have no religion or nationality,\" CM Bugti stated while addressing a press conference at a local hotel in Lahore. The chief minister said that \"some elements\" were bent on undermining Pakistan in the name of nationalism.  Lamenting the Musakhel massacre, he said innocent citizens from Punjab, were brutally killed by terrorists after being forcibly removed from a bus. \"These are terrorists, not disillusioned Balochs,\" the CM insisted. \"The state will stand with the oppressed, and this has nothing to do with nationalism.\" The province witnessed one of the deadliest attacks on August 26 wherein over 50 people, including 14 security personnel, were martyred in different terrorist attacks. He reiterated that the state would not show any leniency to the terrorists, adding that the Balochistan government along with the security forces would take revenge on the terrorists. Referring to the National Action Plan’s provincial apex committee meeting three days ago, the chief minister thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir for their Quetta visits during which important decisions were taken to eliminate terrorists. “We will take the facilitators and sympathisers of the terrorists to task.” He said the government had solid evidence that “it is a [Indian intelligence agency’s] RAW-funded war” and an organised plot was prepared to sabotage the country [via disturbing peace situation] in Balochistan. To a question, CM Bugti said that the terrorists could not choose hard targets, therefore, they were going after “soft targets” by killing common people and labourers. The chief minister once again ruled out dialogue with those elements who were involved in the killings of innocent people and rejecting the Constitution of Pakistan.  The politico clarified that no operation was being conducted in Balochistan, however, the government would certainly chase the terrorists and wipe them out. Last week, CM Bugti pledged that the state would establish its writ and take all necessary steps to cope with security challenges after a surge in terrorism in the province. Vowing to bring the situation under control via smart intelligence-based operations (IBOs), Bugti, in the same statement, revealed that the government was pursuing a smart kinetic approach against terrorists as they lacked strong capacity in Balochistan. He also hinted at limiting 4G internet services in Balochistan following a surge in terrorist attacks and propaganda by anti-state elements against the state."

  "content": "   Slamming the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for not seeking negotiations with political parties, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday said that Imran Khan-founded party was begging for a \"NRO-like deal\" from the establishment. “[PTI spokesperson] Raoof Hasan is begging for an NRO from those who they believe wield real powers,” the defence czar said while speaking on the National Assembly floor. His remarks came in response to Hasan’s interview to Voice of America (VOA), wherein the PTI leader \"hoped and prayed\" that the deadlock between the military and his party does not continue any longer. “In the interest of the state, it is imperative that PTI and the establishment engage in dialogue,” he said, adding that the party had not left any stone unturned to “end this stalemate”. The former ruling party has long maintained stance that it will only hold talks with the powers that be instead of the political parties.  Today, Asif said that Imran Khan “only wanted” to negotiate with the the establishment and seeking the NRO, clarifying that the government has no objection to PTI’s desire to hold dialogue with the establishment.  Over 12 years ago, on October 5, 2007, the-then President and Army Chief, General Pervez Musharraf, had promulgated the National Reconciliation Ordinance, which had granted amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, money laundering, murders and terrorism. However, the minister asked Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai — who had been tasked by PTI founder in this regard — will he hold negotiations with the establishment?  “They [PTI] say Achakzai heads the opposition alliance [Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Ain-e-Pakistan] and he will negotiate,” he said, asking them to decide with whom they want to be engaged.  Reminding the PTI that their past benefactor are no more in power, the defence minister said: “This is a new system with a new leadership.”  The defence minister said the embattled party is looking towards establishment for relief and reiterating negotiations with the Imran Khan-founded party cannot take place until they apologised for the May 9 mayhem. The May 9 incidents refer to the violent protests that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in a corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. Earlier in the day, Asif — while speaking during Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan' — rejected media reports that  PML-N President Nawaz Sharif directed his party to hold talks with all political parties including the PTI. \"We concentrated on two topics only during the meeting, one on holding local bodies elections in Punjab and the other on bringing down electricity prices,\" he said of the party meeting that took place a day earlier."

  "content": "KARACHI: A disruption in the connectivity of various banks with 1LINK — the consortium that operate the largest representative of interbank network in Pakistan — caused immense difficulties for the customers on Monday to withdraw cash from the automated teller machines (ATMs). The disruption resulted in a blockade targeting the cash withdrawal from the ATMs affecting many customers. According to the banks’ customers, the online money transfer was also affected as a consequence of the disruption. Moreover, in response to the customers’ worries and concerns, the officials at 1LINK said that the connectivity with some banks was affected as the issue is being resolved. Notably, earlier in August, days after alleged reports of ATMs facing closures across Pakistan began circulating, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued a clarification, busting the \"fake news\". \"In response to the fake news circulating in the media about potential closure of ATMs, it is clarified that currently there is no such issue of non availability/closure of LDI networks that may potentially impact IT or financial sector including ATM networks,\" the PTA had said in its statement. The authority added that operations of the expired LDI licensees are not suspended or shutdown."

  "content": "    ISLAMABAD: Seeking an amendment to the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act, 1997, a bill was tabled in the Senate on Monday to increase the number of judges in the Supreme Court to 20 — other than the chief justice — to \"address the rising number of pending cases\". The bill titled \"Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act\", 2024, was presented by an independent senator from Balochistan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir. He sought the increase in the number of top court judges from 17 to 21 as \"more than 53,000 cases\" pending in the apex court. According to the bill, a copy of which is available with Geo News, the number of judges of the top court other than the chief justice shall be 20. It further stated: \"The Supreme Court has four jurisdictions original, appellate, advisory, and review being diverse and demanding, contributing to the continuous accumulation of cases.\" \"With economic growth and social changes, the complexity and variety of cases have increase,\" it pointed out. It stressed: \"This backlog, combined with the complexities of integrating the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, necessitates more judicial resources.\" Speaking on the floor of the upper house, Senator Abdul Qadir called for appointing \"at least 16 judges\" to the top court, saying that several constitutional matters were being referred to the top court. \"Larger benches are formed and these judges look into the constitutional matters,\" he added. Not only constitutional cases, but several cases related to financial matters worth billions were also pending in the top court as it does not have time to hear these cases, the senator claimed. \"Our judicial system is lowest on the [global] ranking,\" he added. However, the opposition senators opposed the new legislation. Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar also backed the legislation and suggested forwarding the new bill to the relevant committee. Tarar, while addressing the Senate session, endorsed the points raised by Senator Qadir, saying several cases pertaining to capital punishments still awaiting verdicts since 2015. “A person spent 34 years in jail due to a pending appeal before the top court,” he added. He further said that the architects of the Constitution of Pakistan have not fixed a specific number of judges and gave parliament power to determine the judicial strength. It is noteworthy to mention here that in a bid to reduce pendency of the cases, two retired judges — Justice (retd) Tariq Masood and Justice (retd) Mazhar Alam Miankhel — had been appointed as ad hoc judges to the apex court for a period of one year in July. The appointment of the retired jurists was recommended by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) two months ago which was later approved by President Asif Ali Zardari under Article 182 of the Constitution. In his remarks on the amendment, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Syed Ali Zafar said that the law was \"suddenly tabled\" in the the upper house to increase the number of jurists. He termed the amendments \"an attempt to impose a judicial martial law\" by bringing seven new judges. Zafar added that his party was ready to approve the appointment of two more judges. The senator suggested the government to start increasing the judicial strength from subordinate courts instead of the Supreme Court. He also alleged that Senator Qadir \"is being used\" for the new legislation which he said apparently going in favour of the coalition government. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told journalists earlier today that the party has decided to oppose any amendment bill regarding the judiciary and all their members of parliament have been officially notified about it. \"None of our MNA or senator will vote in the favour of the proposed amendments. Every MNA has been individually instructed in this regard in the light of Article 63 of the Constitution,\" Gohar said. Responding to the PTI’s opposition to the bill, Tarar in today's session said the former ruling party is worried over the proposed amendment as the bill would seize something, asking the opposition party to give logical reasons behind its apprehensions.  \"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) had sought an increase of 10 judges. The PTI is the ruling party there but we are still making the required appointments,\" he added. Taking part in the debate over the new legislation in the upper house of the parliament, Senator Aimal Wali Khan, the president of the Awami National Party (ANP), admitted that a judge cannot hear dozens of cases in a day. Expressing his concerns, Aimal questioned why the government is cherished over the opposition’s bill amid media reports questioning the requirements of additional judges. He was referring to the tabling of the said amendment by an independent senator instead of a government legislator. He also questioned the law minister regarding his pledge to introduce a bill on comprehensive legal reforms. He was of the view that the amendments related to increasing the number of judges could be included in the promised bill. The ANP president recommended the constitution of a separate court for constitutional amendments. Responding to Aimal's query, the law minister said that the federal government will introduce detailed reforms for subordinate courts in the coming days. Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred the bill to the relevant body of the upper house. The coalition government ruled by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has been facing criticism from the opposition parties for planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in the parliament. The Imran-founded party alleged that the recommended legislation could include the extension of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and changes in law regarding the appointments of SC judges based on the principle of seniority. However, the Centre has time and again denied these reports, saying that nothing as such was on the cards as CJP Isa has \"no interest\" in getting an extension. Refuting speculations on the seniority-based law for CJP’s appointment, Law Minister Tarar had said that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new top judge is \"seniority\"."

  "content": "   Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday rebuffed speculations centred on the imminent retirement of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, saying that the top judge does not want extension in his tenure.   The top judge is set to retire in October this year, but as his retirement draws near, rumours of an \"extension\" in his tenure through judiciary-centric legislation in parliament have been rife. However, the Centre has time and again denied these reports, saying that nothing as such was on the cards as CJP Isa has \"no interest\" in getting an extension.  The legal experts say there is no constitutional mechanism for such an extension without amendments to the Constitution. Even if the government wants such an amendment, it would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, which is a challenge in the light of recent Supreme Court verdict on reserved seats favouring Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). \"The two-thirds majority should be discussed when an extension has to be granted,\" Tarar said while addressing an event in Islamabad. He said that the chief justice \"clearly told me and the attorney general that he doesn't want an extension\". The minister said that CJP Qazi Faez Isa is a respectable person and it was not appropriate to repeatedly say that he is seeking an extension.  \"I request the media persons to talk about some other topic as it was unnecessary to discuss the top judge's extension repeatedly,\" he added.  As stated earlier by the law minister, the principle of seniority will be followed in the appointment of a new top judge of the country. Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah is next in line to become the country's top judge. The speculations about CJP Isa's extension gained attraction after the PTI sought an early issuance of notification regarding the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), last month.  While speaking to the media today, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that the party has decided to oppose any amendment bill regarding the judiciary and all their members of parliament have been officially notified about it. \"None of our MNA or senator will vote in the favour of the proposed amendments. Every MNA has been individually instructed in this regard in the light of Article 63 of the Constitution,\" Gohar said.  It may be noted that the controversial apex court judgment of July 2022 on former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi's petition prevents lawmakers from defying party lines in constitutional votes, effectively limiting the government’s ability to secure additional votes through defections. Moreover, speaking about the matter of parleys between the opposition and the government, the PTI chairman said that a dialogue should be held. The PTI chief said his party has also clarified with whom the talks should be held.    \"PTI founder has given the mandate to hold the talks with political parties to Mahmood Achakzai and it is his prerogative to decide the point which should be talked on,\" he added. Gohar further stated that if the party will consider any suggestions presented by the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman. "

  "content": "   RAWALPINDI: An accountability court in Rawalpindi on Monday extended the judicial remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in a new Toshakhana reference. The accountability court's judge Javed Rana conducted the hearing of the new Toshakhana reference pertaining to a jewellery set gifted by the Saudi crown prince. The hearing was attended by the couple's lawyers and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor. The new reference pertains to a case related to a jewellery set gifted to former first lady Bushra by the Saudi crown prince when Imran was the prime minister of the country from 2018 to 2022. At the outset of the hearing, defence lawyer Salman Safdar argued that the new reference was similar to the previous one, therefore, two separate references could not be filed in the same accusation. To this, the prosecutor said that the defence lawyer's claims could only be proved after matching the particulars of both references. The prosecutor also requested the court to summon the judicial record of the old Toshakhana reference, however, the plea was rejected. Later, the judge extended the judicial remand of the former premier and his wife till September 16. The hearing was adjourned till September 6. It is noteworthy to mention here that the couple had filed separate post-arrest bail pleas in the new Toshakhana case last week. Mentioning the state and chairman National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as parties to the case, both the applications filed through Barrister Salman Safdar under Section 9(b) of NA Ordinance 1999 and Section 497 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) request the accountability court to grant post-arrest bail to the couple to in \"interest of justice and fair play\". The jewellery set — comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings — was gifted to the former first lady on her visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2021, as per the NAB's reference. It said the PTI founder and his wife have illegally kept the jewellery set. It added that the deputy military secretary briefed the Toshakhana section officer to estimate and declare the price of the jewellery set. The jewellery set, it mentioned, was not deposited in Toshakhana. The jewellery company sold the necklace for €300,000 and earrings for €80,000 on May 25, 2018. The information regarding the price of the bracelet and ring could not be obtained from the company. On May 28, 2021, the price of the jewellery set was estimated at Rs70.56 million; the price of the necklace was Rs50.64 million and the price of the earrings included in the jewellery valued at Rs10.50 million back then. According to the rules, the 50% price of the jewellery set is approximately Rs30.57 million.  The national exchequer suffered a loss of approximately Rs30.28 after the jewellery was undervalued.  As per the reference, the PTI founder and his wife violated the NAB Ordinance. It added that an inquiry was initiated against the former first couple on the instructions of the NAB chairman on August 1, 2022. “[The] PTI founder and Bushra have misused their powers. [The] PTI founder retained 58 out of 108 gifts during his prime ministership,” read the reference. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been in prison for more than a year after he was booked in a plethora of cases, including the Toshakhana case, cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case. Despite securing relief in several cases, the PTI founder remains behind bars after he was booked in the new Toshakhana case and other cases related to the May 9 mayhem."

  "content": "Air pollution levels slightly decrease in the South Asian country, however, its threats still loom with lack of proper implementation and regulations of climate policy measures \n\n\n\nUpdated Monday Sep 02 2024  KARACHI: With under an insignificant 1% contribution to greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming, Pakistan is among the most exposed nations facing the dire consequences of climate change, including severe weather and environmental degradation, according to the latest findings. In the midst of this already present factor, a slight decline has been noted in the country's air pollution level in 2022 compared with the previous years, the annual Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report disclosed. The overall pollution decreased in South Asia but it still remains one of the world's most polluted regions, according to the report. Despite having cleaner air in 2022, the threat of air contamination still looms over Pakistan and other South Asian countries, as populations continue to breathe contaminated and toxic air particles affecting their life expectancy. Above-normal rainfall, due to favourable meteorological conditions, is likely the primary factor behind the decline in air pollution in Pakistan. Moreover, the World Meteorological Organisation has linked La Niña conditions to increased rainfall during the monsoon season, which contributed to this decline. Additionally, other probable causes behind this decline include the installation of pollution monitors by the government, encouragement to brick kilns to shift towards cleaner technologies and shutdown of factories in highly polluted districts during the winter months when energy demand for heating is high, as per the AQLI report. With rapid industrialisation, economic development, and population growth driving skyrocketing energy demand and fossil fuel consumption across the region, this decline in air pollution may not last long, considering it’s not a major change.  Notably, the monsoon rains have historically caused flash flooding leading to loss of human lives and damage to infrastructure. As a consequence, climate experts and policymakers do not advise dependency upon it in order to lower air pollution. “We have specific monsoon months in which rains fall. What about the other days when there are no monsoon rains,” said environmentalist and climate expert Afia Salam, emphasising that the country cannot solely depend on above-normal rainfalls in order to tackle the air pollution problem. Earth sciences expert from the University of Cambridge, Hassan Aftab Sheikh, while shedding light on the disasters caused by 2022 rains said: “The rainfall brought devastating floods so I would not see it as a way of lowering air pollution. All rain did was bring down suspended particles in the lower atmosphere and lowering PM (particulate matter) averages,” He noted that dependence on rain for lower air pollution is not a sustainable solution and added: “No, we cannot [depend on above normal rainfall]. Lower air pollution should be achieved by controlling the sources of it, not looking at ad-hoc solutions. It was a La Nina year, what about when the average rainfall is lower than expected? We cannot depend on meteorological factors in this case.” The focus on sources of pollution and addressing the root causes of a collective pollution problem was also emphasised by the Founder of Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI) Abid Omar. He said: “Our policies are working 1% to 2% but they aren’t that effective. Pakistan’s policies are not evidence-based. We need to gather evidence on where the most pollution in the country is and what are the causes of it. The Meteorological factors [like above-normal rainfall] have a temporary impact. There needs to be implementation of [current climate] policies.” Additionally, Salam laid importance on the installation of pollution monitors, however, she said: “Pollution monitors are not really controlling pollution, they are telling you if there is bad air which is going to be hazardous for people like children and elderly. As a result, they close schools for a few days because of smog but ordinary people are still affected by it as they don’t even have knowledge about poor air quality. They continue to go on with their daily work.” Though the current climate measures including brick kiln shift towards cleaner technologies as well as cutting off of factory emissions during winters have been regarded as essential, the experts and environmentalists also drew attention towards the necessity of taking additional measures in order to deal with the larger air pollution dilemma. Meeting energy requirements, a check on car fuel efficiency standards and alternatives to the use of nitrogen in the agricultural sector can effectively assist in improving the air quality index in the country, as per the experts. The short-term measures must “hold polluting industries accountable, move them out of cities, stringent laws on car fuel efficiency and the cars on road, and have congestion zones to limit car usage,” Sheikh said. Backing these measures, Omar mentioned: “We also need to have a proper waste management system. The waste and garbage are dumped unsupervised. Moreover, the country’s energy requirements are also stagnant. Many factories still burn their own fuel to meet their electricity requirements. They even burn garbage for this purpose, which leads to poor air quality and there are no checks on this.” Apart from fossil fuel emissions by factories and brick kiln industry, there is already a lot of pollution in the country, Salam noted, adding that it was because of a lack of greenery. “The green cover in the country is less than the worldly recommendation,” she said, pointing towards another significant cause behind the air pollution. If there will be no trees, then there will be no absorption of the emissions. In addition to the lack of green cover, an increased use of nitrogen in the agricultural sector is also a prominent reason behind the pollution. As a consequence, the shift towards cleaner and renewable energy by the government needs to be consistent if we want to solve this issue, according to the experts. Contrary to the short-term policies and measures, Sheikh also proposed long-term measures that can help if implemented. He suggests investing in mass transit infrastructure, shifting to euro 6 fuel (which would be unpopular right now, because even euro 4/5 [whatever is sold] in Pakistan currently) is expensive for the public. Sheikh also recommends transitioning from fossil-fuel-run plants, lowering private vehicle use by having micro-mobility alternatives and having a tractor-sharing scheme where the government gives loans to farmers on sharing tractors for removing crop residue. He further added: “Polluting brick kilns should be sealed.  There should be laws making open waste burning — whether on roads or privately — illegal, as it is a big source both in rural and urban areas and does not appear in source apportionment studies.” Role of rapid solarisation in lowering emissions In addition to the aforementioned sustainable measures, Sheikh considers rapid solarisation crucial for reducing emissions and gradually decreasing air contamination.  However, he said that it should not be relied on solely as other sources should also be taken under consideration. “It can help, but considering the electricity sector is only responsible for about 10% of the air pollution problem, and most of these plants are away from high population density areas, we should focus on other sources for now. Solar power usage would increase itself and the country would transition away from fossil fuels (lowering non-GHG pollutant emissions),” he added. Notably, in 2023, Pakistan remained one of the world's three smoggiest countries, as Bangladesh and India replaced Chad and Iran, with particulate matter about 15 times the level recommended by the World Health Organisation, reported Reuters. In addition to economic and infrastructural benefits, a decrease in air pollution significantly impacts people’s health and their overall life expectancy. According to the AQLI report, in Pakistan, where the PM 2.5 concentration was 38.9 µg/m³ in 2022 —10% lower compared to the particulate levels in 2021, the average resident would gain 3.3 years from meeting the WHO guideline. Those in Peshawar, the most polluted city in the country, would gain 5.6 years, it added. Laying prominence on air quality’s relation with people’s health, PQLI's Communications Head Mariam Shah said: “We cannot solely depend on nature or divine intervention to mitigate the air pollution crisis. If we don’t take properly planned, cross-sectoral, well-implemented sustainable steps towards reducing air pollution, soon we will not be able to do any outdoor activities at any time of the year, let alone during the smog season. Air pollution is a very real health emergency which is exacerbating with each passing year.” The decline in air pollution levels may not be massive but it can still be meaningful with proper regulations and implementations of already passed policies as well as with the introduction and usage of newer cleaner and renewable technologies.  An environment-friendly people-centric approach and consideration of economically stable climate measures can aid in the maintenance of good air quality in the country where millions continue to breathe toxic air.

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Rejecting media reports about a PML-N meeting wherein President Nawaz Sharif directed his party to hold talks with all political parties including the PTI to take the country out of the crises, Federal Minister for Defence Khawaja Asif said that Nawaz did not even speak on politics in the said meeting let alone extending an olive branch to the Imran Khan-founded party.  Speaking during Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan' on Sunday, the defence czar said neither any such thing was discussed in the meeting nor Nawaz gave instructions in this regard.  \"We concentrated on two topics only during the meeting, one on holding local bodies elections in Punjab and the other on bringing down electricity prices,\" he said.  Asif also said that unless the PTI apologised for the May 9 violent incidents, there would be no room for progress in the negotiations with them.  “Accountability of the May 9 incidents should be held 200%,” he said. He further maintained that the opposition party directly or indirectly expressing desire for negotiations was devoid of sincerity. The minister, while pointing towards PTI founder Imran Khan’s erratic behavior, said even PTI members did not trust Khan and lamented about his egoistic and opportunistic attitude. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he added, offered the PTI to hold talks multiple times. Khwaja Asif that the premier had even proposed the Imran Khan-founded party to sign a charter of economy. However, neither the PTI founder nor any of his ministers responded to the proposal, he revealed. \"The PTI founder (then PM) sat turning his back towards the opposition with arrogance,” he said, stressing how his camaraderie with former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed was on peak at the time. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said even as the premier, Shehbaz invited them for negotiations and a charter of economy.  “Just few months ago, PM Shehbaz Sharif walked the floor of the National Assembly to their seats. He shook hands with the entire PTI leadership,” he said describing the prime minister’s amicable conduct with the opposition.  PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui also endorsed Asif’s statement, saying that the party president Nawaz Sharif did not offer or invite the PTI for talks. “Nawaz Sharif has not approached anyone,” he said adding that the PML-N president did want that his party initiate dialogue with its political arch-rival. He further stated the statements of PTI leaders were usually devoid of truth. On the other hand, he said, the PTI kept insisting on holding talks with the establishment. Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan has \"hoped and prayed\" that the deadlock between the military and his party does not continue any longer, expressing willingness to talk with the latter. \"Our position has always been that we want to engage with them\", the PTI spokesperson said in an interview with Voice of America (VOA) on Sunday, noting that the party’s doors are open for dialogue with them. The PTI has long stated that it will only hold talks with those who wield real power in the country. However, the director general Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on May 7 demanded that \"those involved in the May 9 violent protests apologise\" and shun politics of “anarchy” before holding any dialogue. The May 9 incidents refer to the violent protests that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in a corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. \"In the interest of the state, it is imperative that PTI and the establishment engage in dialogue,\" he said, adding that the party had not left any stone unturned to \"end this stalemate\". However, Raoof clarified, that the talks would be held within the ambit of the Constitution. “Instability will end, once all institutions start working within the limits of the Constitution,” he added. The remarks came amid reports that the PML-N had purportedly approached Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai to broker talks with the PTI — a claim he confirmed as per The News. \"All the political leadership, including Nawaz Sharif, is on the same page about the Constitution, I have met Rana Sanaullah. There is no other way to take the country forward except through negotiations,\" Achakzai said during an informal conversation with journalists in Islamabad. However, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan rejected the reports and said his party hasn't offered any talks to the incumbent ruling party. \"The PTI neither offered to engage in talks [with the ruling party] nor sought any favours [from them],\" Barrister Gohar said while speaking to Geo News on Sunday. Earlier on July 31, the incarcerated PTI founder said that his party was ready to sit down with the military. Speaking to journalists in Adiala Jail, he said: \"We are ready to hold talks with the military. The army should nominate their representative [for negotiations].\" Khan reiterated that the incumbent government wanted to destroy his party by driving a wedge between the PTI and the armed forces."

  "content": "The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Monday said it will begin suspending mobile SIMs of users who have not renewed their Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC). The authority's announcement comes as it begins the second phase of its operation to stop the illegal use of SIMs across Pakistan. \"Those whose ID cards have expired before 2017 and have not been renewed, their SIMs will be suspended,\" said PTA in a statement issued today. The authority has urged users to get their identity cards renewed to avoid getting their SIMs blocked. It should be noted that PTA blocked fake SIMs and cancelled CNICs of citizens in the first phase after initiating the operation. \"Since August 16, more than 69,000 illegal SIMs have been blocked,\" the statement read, adding that the illegal SIMs are being blocked on the basis of data obtained from National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra). Meanwhile, the authority will terminate SIMs registered in the names of deceased persons during the third phase. Before the blocking of mobile SIMs, awareness messages were sent to users, asking them to update relevant data. The statement by the PTA maintained that fake SIMs are being used in various illegal activities including terrorism, financial fraud and other activities. In the last three and a half years, the authority has blocked more than 363,000 URLs in the category of illegal content. From January 2021 to June 2024, the category of defamatory or impersonating content had the lowest blocking rate. Social media platforms blocked 307,610 of these URLs. The overall blocking rate is 84.72%. The PTA is taking action on 2,480 URLs related to contempt of court. Social media platforms blocked 1,496 of them. The blocking rate is 60.32%. Rate of blocking content against security and defence is slightly higher. The PTA examined 10,1682 URLs, of which 74,224 were blocked, thus a blocking rate of 73%. It took action over 6,853 URLs in the miscellaneous content category and social media platforms and blocked 5,621 of them. The rate of blocking content against the glory of Islam was also high, where action was taken on 46,103 URLs and 37,479 were blocked. 34,673 URLs were examined and 28,922 blocked for sectarianism and hate speech content. The highest blocking rate was seen in the unethical category, where 158,054 URLs were examined and 152,646 blocked. It has a content blocking rate of 96.46%, with all 51 URLs related to proxy content blocked."

  "content": "MIANWALI: At least two policemen sustained injuries after more than a dozen terrorists attacked Qabool Khel police check post in Punjab's Mianwali on Monday. According to a police spokesperson, about 12 to 14 khawarij attacked the check post with rockets and hand grenades.  However, the Punjab Police thwarted attacked by the terrorists after which they escaped, said the spokesperson, adding that two cops were injured in the attack.  Following the incident, district police officer of Mianwali, Deputy Superintendent of Police Isa Khel reached the check post along with heavy personnel. Last month, at least 12 policemen were martyred and six sustained injuries after bandits attacked their vans with rockets in a riverine area of Punjab's Rahim Yar Khan.  The horrific attack occurred in the Machka area located in one of Rahim Yar Khan's riverine areas. Police officials told the media that two police vans with more than 20 cops were trapped in rainwater in the locality when bandits launched rockets at them. As a result of the fierce attack, a dozen cops were martyred while seven others were wounded and five went missing, the police added. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in the northwestern border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but also in southwestern Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. There were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to root out militants sheltering on Afghan soil as they prepare to stage assaults on Pakistan. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said Monday that humid winds from the Bay of Bengal are expected to sweep across upper areas of Pakistan, bringing more heavy monsoon rains from today till September 5. Predicting the impact of the humid winds, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a warning for heavy rains in the region today and tomorrow (Tuesday), sparking fear of floods and landslides in different areas. As a precautionary measure, all district administrations remain on high alert to the forecasted weather conditions, said PDMA.   Meanwhile, according to PMD's Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz, the new system will bring moderate rainfall in northeastern Punjab, while light rain is likely to hit Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad and other areas of the province today. Meanwhile, the PMD on Monday recorded the minimum temperature in Karachi at 25°C while the maximum temperature in the city is likely to fluctuate between 31°C to 33°C. With 92% humidity and westward winds blowing at a light speed, the PMD forecast shows a cloudy skies over the port city with a possibility of light rain or drizzle at night. According to the Met Office, the new system may also bring rain to some parts of Sindh, including Hyderabad, Thatta, Tharpakar, Mithi, and Badin, by tomorrow (Tuesday) while Karachi is likely to get light and heavy rain on September 4.  During an appearance on the Geo News programme show \"Geo Pakistan\", earlier today, Sardar said that the new system is also likely to bring heavy rains to northeastern Balochistan, which has already been devasted by the previous spell. He added that the intensity of heat may increase after September 7. The prediction of the new rain system comes after the country, especially parts of Sindh, experienced heavy rainfall and strong winds under the influence of cyclone Asna, which dissipated in the sea, without making landfall on any coast."

However, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan rejected the reports and said his party hasn't offered any talks to the incumbent ruling party. \"The PTI neither offered to engage in talks [with the ruling party] nor sought any favours [from them],\" Barrister Gohar said while speaking to Geo News on Sunday. Earlier on July 31, the incarcerated PTI founder said that his party was ready to sit down with the military. Speaking to journalists in Adiala Jail, he said: \"We are ready to hold talks with the military. The army should nominate their representative [for negotiations].\" Khan reiterated that the incumbent government wanted to destroy his party by driving a wedge between the PTI and the armed forces."

APP/File   FO stresses dispute must be resolved in line with UNSC resolution.Says claims not only misleading but &ldquo;dangerously delusional&rdquo;.Spox adds India&rsquo;s...",
  "content": "  In response to Indian Minister for External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar’s remarks on the disputed region of Kashmir, the Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday unequivocally rejected \"any narrative that suggests that the dispute has been or can be settled unilaterally\".  “The Jammu and Kashmir dispute is internationally recognised and must be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people. Resolution of this unresolved conflict is pivotal to peace and stability in South Asia,” FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in a statement.  On Friday, Jaishankar said that the era of \"uninterrupted dialogue\" with Pakistan is over while saying that New Delhi will respond to developments \"whether positive or negative\".  \"So far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, Article 370 is done. The issue [now] is what kind of relationship we can contemplate with Pakistan,\" the Indian media quoted him as saying at a private event.  Responding to the remarks, Baloch said that such claims were not only \"misleading but dangerously delusional, as they blatantly disregard the on-ground realities\".  \"India’s unilateral actions in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) cannot and will not change this reality,” she added. The spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to diplomacy and dialogue but warned that any hostile actions would be met with \"unyielding resolve\".  She urged India to abandon its \"provocative rhetoric\" about the Indian occupied territory, and to instead engage in a meaningful dialogue for a just and lasting resolution to the dispute.  The statement stressed that true peace and stability in South Asia can only be achieved through a settlement in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the inalienable rights of the Kashmiri people.  Pakistan downgraded its ties with India after the Modi-led government unilaterally changed the special status of the IIOJK in August 2019 — the decision that Islamabad believed undermined the environment for holding talks between the neighbours. Islamabad has linked its decision to normalising ties with New Delhi with the restoration of the special status of the IIOJK.  Despite the frosty ties, the two countries agreed to renew the 2003 ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) in February 2021."

  "content": "KARACHI: Two minor boys and a young man were killed after falling into a 120-foot-deep submersible pump well located in a Karachi neighbourhood, police said on Sunday. The tragic incident took place inside the compound of a residential building near Fawara Chowk in Garden East on Sunday evening.  Eyewitnesses said the boys were \"jumping\" on the lid of the well when it suddenly broke under their weight, sending the victims, aged 8 and 12, crashing down to the bottom, where a submersible water pump was installed. In a panic, the residents called a local plumber to go down the well and rescue the children, but tragically, he met the same fate when the rope he was hanging onto snapped, according to the residents.   As soon as the authorities were alerted on the matter, rescuers were dispatched to the spot.  The rescue teams told Geo News that they faced difficulty in pulling the children out of the well because it was very narrow.  Both the children, identified as Badar and Talha, and the plumber were pulled out in critical condition and were later declared dead. They said that one of their workers also got stuck inside the well but he was later pulled out safely.  Speaking to Geo News, the residents said that when the plumber stepped into the well, he told them about the \"lack of oxygen\" inside.  \"He tied both children to his body with a rope and asked us to pull it up, but it broke,\" they said.

  "content": " Commenting on recent terrorist attacks across Balochistan that claimed over 50 lives, including those of civilians and security personnel, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Sunday that 'some elements' were bent on undermining Pakistan in the name of nationalism. \"It was not a 'Baloch' individual who killed a Punjabi. The 'terrorists' targeted Pakistanis. They have no religion or nationality,\" CM Bugti stated while addressing a press conference at a local hotel in Lahore.  Lamenting the Musakhal massacre, he said innocent citizens from Punjab, were brutally killed by terrorists after being forcibly removed from a bus. \"These are terrorists, not disillusioned Balochs,\" the CM insisted adding, \"The state will stand with the oppressed, and this has nothing to do with nationalism.\" The province witnessed one of the deadliest attacks on August 26 wherein over 50 people, including 14 security personnel, were martyred in different terrorist attacks.   He reiterated that the state would not show any leniency to the terrorists, adding that the Balochistan government along with the security forces would take revenge on the terrorists. Referring to the National Action Plan’s provincial apex committee meeting three days ago, the chief minister thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir for their Quetta visits during which important decisions were taken to eliminate terrorists. “We will take the facilitators and sympathisers of the terrorists to task.” He said the government had solid evidence that “it is a [Indian intelligence agency’s] RAW-funded war” and an organised plot was prepared to sabotage the country [via disturbing peace situation] in Balochistan. To a question, CM Bugti said that the terrorists could not choose hard targets, therefore, they were going after “soft targets” by killing common people and labourers. The chief minister once again ruled out dialogue with those elements who were involved in the killings of innocent people and rejecting the Constitution of Pakistan.  The politico clarified that no operation was being conducted in Balochistan, however, the government would certainly chase the terrorists and wipe them out. Last week, CM Bugti pledged that the state would establish its writ and take all necessary steps to cope with security challenges after a surge in terrorism in the province. Vowing to bring the situation under control via smart intelligence-based operations (IBOs), Bugti, in the same statement, revealed that the government was pursuing a smart kinetic approach against terrorists as they lacked strong capacity in Balochistan. He also hinted at limiting 4G internet services in Balochistan following a surge in terrorist attacks and propaganda by anti-state elements against the state."

  "description": "• Proposed law seeks to increase number of SC judges to 21 to clear backlog; PTI terms it ‘court-stacking’ • Bill empowers magistrate to ban gatherings in capital, proposes 3-year jail term for violation; PTI cries foul • Bill for rights of divorced women referred to panel; opinion sought from Council of Islamic Ideology ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday tab­led separate bills in the Sen­ate to regulate public gatherings in Islamabad — a week before the PTI’s Sept 8 jalsa — and incre­ase the number of judges in the Supreme Court to clear the backlog, much to the chagrin of the former ruling party whose lawmakers opposed both proposed laws. One of the bills ‘Pea­ceful Assembly and Public Order Bill 2024’ aimed to empower the district magistrate to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islam­abad, saying the event coordinator would need to apply for permission in writing seven days before the event. The bill supported by the PPP, Balochistan Awa­mi Party, Muttahida Qau­mi Movement (MQM-P), and the Awami National Party was moved by PML-N Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui. Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to the Standing Committee on Law and Justice, seeking a report within two days. According to the draft of the bill, “…the district magistrate before granting permission shall examine the prevailing law and order situation and obtain security clearance reports from law enforcement agencies.” It also aimed to empower the government to designate a specific area of the ICT as a “red zone” or “high-security zone”, prohibiting all types of assemblies in that area. Similarly, it said that the magistrate shall not permit any assembly in any area other than the designated area. “The assembly shall proceed and take place at the specified locality or route, in the manner and during the times mentioned in the permission,” it read. The magistrate can deny the permission if the gathering poses any risk to public safety or national safety or in case of reports from law enforcement agencies about the risk of violence. The permission can also be denied if the gathering disrupts routine life or if any other procession is being held at the time.      The ban on assembly under the proposed law will remain in force for the duration specified by the district magistrate, which may be extended if the conditions necessitating the ban persist. “An officer-in-charge of a police station, on the instruction of the district magistrate, may command any assembly likely to disturb the public peace to disperse,” it said, adding that participants would have to comply with the directive. In case of non-compliance, force can be used and if necessary police can detain the members of “such unlawful assembly”. “Whoever having been convicted by a court in Pakistan of an offence punishable under this act with imprisonment for a term of three years or more shall for every subsequent offence be liable to imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years,” it read.      Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the bill was meant to ensure order and safety of people and regulate public meetings. He said some other cities, including Lahore, already had such laws. Strongly opposing the bill, PTI Opposition Leader Syed Shibli Faraz termed the bill mala fide and noted that there was no doubt it was ‘PTI-specific’. “The law minister should have rejected it to prove his credentials. In the worst case scenario, the bill be referred to the standing committee,” he said while speaking on the topic. Parliamentary leader of PTI Syed Ali Zafar also said the bill was “PTI-specific and meant to keep the party out of Islamabad”. Number of judges ‘The Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024’ which sought to increase the number of judges, excluding the chief justice, from 17 to 20 was also referred to the standing committee concerned. The proposed law was moved by Balochistan’s independent senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir to “address the rising number [of] pending cases”.      The Supreme Court has four jurisdictions: original, appellate, advisory, and review…contributing to [the] continuous accumulation of cases. The PTI opposed the bill, alleging that it had been brought with ill-intent to install hand-picked judges to get favourable decisions. Senator Qadir, the mover of the bill, said its purpose was to ensure quick justice and clear pendency of over 53,000 cases in the apex court. The litigants have to wait up to two years to get their cases fixed in the top court, he said. Senator Qadir said the judges continue to delay decisions on common people’s cases because of their engagements with a number of cases involving constitutional matters. He described the growing population as another reason to increase the number. The PTI leader Ali Zafar said that the government should have introduced reforms in the lower judiciary instead of talking about increasing the number of judges in the SC. “This is called court-stacking,” he said, adding that several African, Latin American, and Asian countries in the past had increased the number of judges in the superior judiciary in line with the same practice. “The purpose is to take over the court system by bringing those judges who are favourable to a certain regime.” ANP Senator Aimal Wali Khan called for establishing a separate constitutional court. He said it was necessary to increase the number of judges in lower courts. Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, indirectly supporting the bill, warned the opposition not to politicise the issue. He said appeals by prisoners facing death and life imprisonment had been pending since 2015. He underlined that the framers of the Consti­tution did not fix the number of judges in the superior judiciary and left it open for the parliament to do so from time to time. He said the government would examine the bill and then respond, requesting the chair to refer the matter to the committee concerned. Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Monday echoed the concerns and criticism of opposition lawmakers over the damage to roads and streets during the recent short spells of light to moderate rain in the city. Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani assured the concerned lawmakers that those responsible for the damage to newly constructed or recently repaired roads and streets across the city would be held accountable. He added that consultants for various development projects had been asked to submit review reports on this matter. In response to separate call attention notices from Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Muhammad Aamir Siddiqui and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed Sunni Ittehad Council’s Muhammad Shabbir, the LG minister stated that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), under the Competitive and Livable City of Karachi (Click) project, had either built or restored 400 roads and streets in the city. “The recent rains have damaged around 15 of these roads,” he said, assuring lawmakers that the provincial government would investigate the damages. The MQM-P lawmaker’s notice highlighted that only 20-30 mm of rain in his constituency caused severe damage due to a lack of patchwork despite multiple complaints. “Areas affected include Lasbella, Patel Para, Gurumandir, Jahangir Road, Jail Road, Jail Chowrangi, PIB Colony, Meena Bazar, Martin Quarters, and Clayton Quarters,” the notice stated. Mr Siddiqui noted that the city’s road infrastructure had been badly affected by even brief spells of light rain.  Ghani assures PA of accountability of those responsible for substandard work  “Jahangir Road was freshly constructed just eight months ago and has been completely damaged,” he lamented, adding that the road behind Bilawal House in the Clifton area was also damaged. He suggested that the house be informed about the technology used by KMC in road construction, which he claimed led to the destruction of roads within three months. He proposed transferring the responsibility for construction and repairs from the city’s municipality to the provincial government’s works and services department. Mr Siddiqui also criticised the city mayor and town chairmen for not improving the city and stated that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation had been problematic since coming under the mayor’s administration.      The LG minister explained that repair work on the main roads in Karachi damaged by rainwater would be carried out in the first phase after the monsoon season ends. Work on smaller roads and streets would follow in the second phase. He mentioned that monsoon rains in Karachi had persisted for a prolonged period and that, after repairing major arteries, work would immediately begin to restore smaller roads, alleys, and streets. Mr Ghani stated that repair work on damaged roads could not commence during the monsoon rains. “The KMC and towns have been directed to survey the damaged roads and streets so that restoration work can begin promptly after the rains,” he said. He noted that some areas of the city had received up to 200 to 250 mm of rain in various spells and that Karachi and other parts of the province had experienced heavy rains in previous monsoons as well. In response to another call attention notice from Jamaat-i-Islami’s lone lawmaker Muhammad Farooq, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Linjar said that the police were working to protect the public at great personal risk. “It is our responsibility to maintain law and order, and the provincial government will fulfil this responsibility,” he added. Earlier, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon gave a policy statement, stating that the provincial government had made adequate preparations before the monsoon rains, which helped keep the situation under control and prevented major damage. “The chief minister and the entire provincial administration were active, which prevented significant damage,” he added. He also affirmed the provincial government’s commitment to combating drug proliferation in society and promised to take all possible measures to address the issue. Meanwhile, Speaker Syed Awais Shah scheduled Friday for a discussion on an adjournment motion submitted by PPP lawmaker Nisar Ahmed Khurho. The adjournment motion sought a discussion on the implementation of the Water Accord by the Indus River System Authority. The house was adjourned to Tuesday (today).

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakhtun­khwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) president Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday declared on the floor of the National Assembly that he was ready to engage in talks with the ‘establishment’ for the sake of the supremacy of constitution and to bring the country out of the prevailing crisis. The unexpected announcement for the treasury members came in response to a fiery speech by Defence Minister and PML-N stalwart Khawaja Asif who had asked Speaker Ayaz Sadiq to seek a reply from the PkMAP chief, who had been nominated by the opposition PTI for a dialogue, if he was willing to hold talks with the establishment. Castigating the PTI leaders over their repeated statements that they would not talk to the political parties sitting in parliament and would only like to have dialogue with the army, the defence minister threw the question towards Mr Achakzai, perhaps expecting that he would refuse to talk to the establishment because of his strong narrative that politicians should not drag the army into politics. “I will hold negotiations. I will talk to every institution. I will also talk to the establishment, but …. we do not want to talk to them and ask them to provide us guidance. We are to provide them honourable retreat,” said Mr Achakzai amid desk-thumping by the opposition members.  Hard hitting remarks came in response to fiery speech by defence minister  “We will tell the establishment that you are our establishment. You are dear to us. You are our army, our institution. Please be kind with us and [it’s] enough. Sit with us.      “The supremacy of the constitution is the only solution and this whole house has consensus on this,” he said, adding that all the parties and leaders, including PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif and President Asif Zardari, believe in it. He said if this parliament would be made a true supreme institution through democratic elections, the country would come out of the crises. Mr Achakzai said the politicians and the army and everyone was responsible for the present situation and the time had come to sit together, admit the past mistakes and move forward. He said on one hand Nawaz Sharif stressed the need for a political dialogue, on the other “you people start stabbing each other in the back”. The PkMAP chief asked the speaker not to behave as a member of PML-N and become a true custodian of the house. He asked the speaker to play a role and make his party leadership realise that there is a need for dialogue with all the parties and institutions. “Come and sit together, including the Chief of Army Staff. We should sit together to find the solution to the prevailing crisis, which has not descended from the sky,” he went on saying. The debate on the political dialogue started when opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, on a point of order, refuted the claim of Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal that Imran Khan was begging for a deal. “Imran Khan has never got NRO and he will never get it,” said the opposition leader. Responding to the opposition leader’s speech, the defence minister reiterated that Mr Khan was “desperate” to strike a deal. He said PTI’s information secretary Raoof Hassan was desperately begging before the establishment whereas Imran Khan had been issuing statements from jail on a daily basis that he would only talk to the army. He said they should ask Mr Achakzai if he was willing to talk to the establishment on behalf of PTI which was not ready to sit with any political party and only looking towards the establishment for reconciliation. He said PTI wanted to talk to those who had “nourished the party”, forgetting that it no longer had the support of former ISI heads Shuja Pasha and Faiz Hameed, and former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. On Saturday, former prime minister and PML-N president Nawaz Sharif had suggested an across-the-board dialogue to pull the country out of crisis. However, the PTI next day ruled out the possibility of direct talks with the PML-N and favoured negotiations with the establishment instead. Later, the National Assembly passed four bills amid noisy protest by the opposition. The bills passed were the Apostille Bills 2024, the Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority Bill 2024, the Establishment of Telecommunication Appellate Tribunal Bill 2024 and the Privatisation Commission (Amendment) Bill 2024.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The country continues to experience increased terrorist attacks as a total of 59 terrorist attacks occurred across the country in August 2024 compared to 38 such attacks in the previous month. These incidents included 29 attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 28 in Balochistan and two in Punjab, killing 84 people and 166 others injured, according to the digital database of security incidents managed by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), an Islamabad-based think-tank. Balochistan experienced 28 terrorist incidents during August 2024, which resulted in 57 deaths and injuries to another 84 people. Most of these terrorism-related casualties in the province resulted from the banned BLA-orchestrated attacks on August 26 in over seven districts of the province targeting security forces, non-Baloch people (mainly Punjabis) and national infrastructure. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 29 terrorist attacks took place, claiming 25 lives and wounding 80 others. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and a few local Taliban groups reportedly carried out these attacks.  KP experienced 29 attacks, Balochistan 28 and Punjab 2, killing 84 people and injuring 166 others  Meanwhile, two reported attacks from Punjab injured two civilians; two of the attackers were also killed. Security forces and the counterterrorism departments (CTDs) of the police conducted 12 anti-militant operations in the country in August compared to 11 in the previous month.      In these operations, 88 militants were killed and 15 army soldiers and three policemen martyrdom. Eight out of the 12 reported operations took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while four others took place in Balochistan. Of the total 28 attacks recorded in Balochistan in August this year, 26 were carried out by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), including the group’s extensive terrorist onslaught on August 26. PIPS in its monthly security report said that the armed group has escalated its destructive activities, executing high-impact attacks and using female suicide bombers. On August 26, the anniversary of Baloch chieftain Nawab Akbar Bugti’s death, the group launched coordinated attacks across Balochistan. The report underlines that the involvement of numerous militants and the use of sophisticated weaponry including vehicle-borne explosives, indicate the BLA’s growing capabilities. The group has adopted new tactics, such as targeting Punjabis on highways by checking identity cards — a development that may further strain relations between the province and the central government, which seems to be one of the banned entity’s objectives. Positioning itself as a defender of Baloch interests, the BLA exploits grievances like enforced disappearances and resource exploitation.      As the Baloch people lose faith in the political process, the group may gain more support. To counter this, the government must create political and social spaces for the Baloch people, the report said. Additionally, there is an urgent need to investigate the BLA’s sources of training, weapons and funding. Pakistan should engage constructively with Afghanistan and Iran to develop a joint counterterrorism and border security strategy, the report advised. Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2024 "

  "description": "KARACHI: A CCTV (close circuit television) footage of the Karsaz accident case was sent to Punjab for forensic analysis, the investigating officer (IO) of the case informed a sessions court on Monday. Suspect Natasha Danish has been booked and arrested for recklessly driving her Toyota Land Cruiser and killing Imran Arif, 60, and his daughter Amna, 22, and wounding three others in an accident on Aug 19. On Monday, the IO appeared before Judicial Magistrate (East) Muhammad Raza Ansari while the suspect, Natasha, appeared in the court through a video link from the Central Prison for Women, Karachi. Earlier in the day, the court allowed an application under Section 540 of the CrPC, moved by the defence counsel seeking a one-day exemption from the suspect’s in-person appearance in the court. Deputy District Prosecutor (East) Muhammad Younus told Dawn that the exemption might have been granted due to “security concerns”.  IO says UK High Commission approached to verify suspect’s driving licence  During the hearing, the IO informed the court that Section 100 (driving while under the influence of drink or drugs) of the Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965 had been included in the FIR. He further stated that the CCTV footage of the incident had been sent to Punjab for forensic analysis. Officials said that the footage was sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency as per routine practice of the Sindh police due to the lack of sophisticated equipment in the provincial labs. Additionally, a letter has been written to the UK High Commission to verify Natasha’s UK driving license. The IO also mentioned that letters had been sent to the concerned union council of the area and the traffic DIG regarding the damage to public property and their responses were still awaited. When the court inquired about the condition of the injured persons, including Abdul Salam in the incident, the IO informed the court that their condition had improved and provided details about the injuries they sustained. The IO requested the court for 14 more days to submit the interim challan, stating that the responses to the letters were pending. After hearing the IO, the court granted three days and directed him to submit the interim challan by Sept 5. Another suspect held, remanded in rape case A judicial magistrate on Monday remanded another suspect into police custody in a case of alleged gang rape and murder of a minor girl. The suspect was arrested in wounded condition after an ‘encounter,’ the police claimed. South-DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn the suspect was involved in the recent rape-cum-murder of a 12-year-old  girl whose body stuffed in a gunny bag was recovered from a garbage dump near Lucky Star in Saddar. On Monday, investigation officer (IO) Shama, brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate  (South) Zahid Ali, seeking his 14-day physical custody for further interrogation. The IO informed the court that the police arrested the suspect during an intelligence-based operation, adding that during interrogation, the suspect confessed that he had strangled the girl with a piece of cloth. After hearing the IO, the court remanded the suspect into police custody for one day and directed the IO to produce him on Tuesday (today). Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2024 "

  "description": "• Says he prefers negotiations with ‘those’ who brought PML-N to power • Irfan Siddiqui claims Nawaz has not extended talks offer to PTI ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has said federal ministers start crying over the May 9 events whenever the PTI speaks about talks, emphasising that he always remains open to dialogue, even with the government. However, the PTI founding chairman said he would prefer to engage in talks with those — a reference to the establishment — who have brought the PML-N to power, as dialogue with the current government would be futile. Speaking to the media after attending the Toshakhana reference hearing at an accountability court on Monday, Mr Khan said the PML-N had initially contested the election to respect the vote, but now they are respecting the “boot” instead.      He added that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif might be eligible for a Guinness World Record for taking a U-turn on his narrative of respecting the vote and losing the match despite having open support from four umpires. Mr Khan claimed that Mr Sharif had managed to defeat Yasmin Rashid with 74,000 bogus votes. He pointed out that PML-N leaders Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal used to criticise the military and are seeking “my apology for May 9 incidents”. According to the former premier, the PML-N is using May 9 events to secure their future as they started crying over these protests whenever PTI speaks about the talks. He demanded a judicial probe into the May 9 protests and clai­med that those who removed the CCTV footage were behind the conspiracy. He said the PTI’s upcoming public meeting on Sept 8 has three main objectives. “We want return of stolen mandate, getting rid of the ‘qabza group’ and independence of the judiciary,” he said, adding that the judiciary is being attacked to extend the tenure of the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan. No talks offer PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui claimed on Monday that Nawaz Sharif had not extended an offer of talks to the opposition PTI. “Nawaz Sharif has not taken the name of even PTI or dialogue with it during a party meeting held two days ago,” Mr Siddiqui, known for his close association with the PML-N president, said in a statement. “We have not extended any offer to the PTI for dialogue.” The PML-N senator said Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Achakzai is a respectable person and anyone could hold talks with him. “It is absurd that we want to hold talks with PTI through Achakzai.”      He ruled out the possibility of PTI-PML-N talks and said the opposition par­ty was not reliable as it always promoted politics of lies. He stated that PTI leaders are worried these days as the decision in the 190m pound corruption case against Imran Khan is expected soon. During a Geo News programme on Sunday, senior PML-N leader Khawaja Asif claimed that the party’s meeting on Saturday did not discuss any political matters. He said Nawaz Sharif did not mention reaching out to the PTI, adding that the current atmosphere is not conducive for such negotiations. It may be recalled that the PML-N’s statement, issued after the party’s meeting in Lahore on Saturday, followed a meeting between Mr Achakzai and PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah and gave rise to speculations that the government was interested in seeking a dialogue with the PTI. Media reports said Nawaz Sharif had suggested an across-the-board dialogue to pull the country out of crises. However, the PTI ruled out the possibility of direct talks with PML-N and favoured negotiations with the establishment instead. PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan had said the deadlock between the army and the PTI needed to be ended and that the former ruling party was interested in talking to the powers that be in this regard. According to the PTI leader, who was recently released from jail in a cybercrime case, a dialogue between the PTI and the establishment was imperative for the sake of the state’s interests. He reiterated that PTI wanted to end this deadlock. The PTI spokesperson said his party had done whatever it could to improve ties with the army, but underscored that any talks in this regard would be within the ambit of the Constitution.

  "description": "ISLAMABAD: The government has once again asked its employees to refrain from using social media to express political or religious opinions as well as from sharing information with any unauthorised government official or the media. In a circular issued on Monday, the Establishment Division referred to the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules 1964 that barred the employees from making any statement capable of embarrassing the government in any document published or in any communication made to the press or in any public utterance or television programme. The fresh circular by the Establishment Division alluded to similar circulars issued in August 2021 and July 2020 which said the government servants could not appear on any media platform without the government’s permission. It said the rules also barred a government servant from expressing views against the ideology and integrity of Pakistan or any government policy or decision. The government employees have been warned that violation of one or more of these instructions will be tantamount to misconduct and disciplinary action can be taken against the delinquent government servant under Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020.  Circular stops govt employees from expressing political, religious opinions, sharing information with unauthorised persons  The circular said despite the instructions and legal framework, it “has been observed that government servants often engage themselves with social media…that enable users to create and share contents or participate in social networking such as virtual communities and online groups”.      “They, while using different social media platforms…air their views on a host of subjects, sometimes indulge in actions or behaviour that does not conform to the required standards of official conduct,” the circular added. Government officials have been directed to abstain from showing their political party affiliations or even engaging in business promotions without proper permission. “In order to maintain their impartiality and objectivity in performance, the government employees will not take part in any discussion on social media or exchange or forward information or messages that express their opinion on political issues,” the circular said, adding that the employees will not participate in furthering of any information especially pertaining to government matters that, prima facie, appears to be unauthentic and misleading. The circular also said that the instructions were not intended to discourage any constructive and positive use of social media by a government organisation. “However, such an organisation shall edit their social media platforms continuously or frequently to remove offensive, inappropriate and objectionable remarks,” the circular added.

  "description": "LAHORE: The decades-old rivalry between two underworld dons of Lahore — Khwaja Gulshan alias Teefi Butt and the slain Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala — reportedly took another ugly turn on Monday when Butt’s brother-in-law was shot dead while his sister was critically injured by the sharpshooters near the FC College Underpass on the Canal Road.      The attack on the family members of Teefi Butt is being seen as a sign of looming threats of a gang war in the provincial capital. It was the third murder in connection with the old rivalry between the Teefi Butt and Tipu Truckanwala gangs during the last few months. Talking about the Monday’s incident, an official said the unidentified armed men ambushed the SUV of Butt’s brother-in-law, Javed Butt, who was himself driving the vehicle. He said Javed and his wife were attacked when they were going to pick their kids from a school in Ichhra. Quoting initial inquiries, the police official said the armed motorcyclists intercepted the vehicle of Javed Butt after a recce. As the vehicle slowed down at the traffic congestion on Canal Road near the FC College Underpass, the shooters who were chasing the couple sprayed them with a volley of bullets.  Teefi’s brother-in-law killed, sister injured by sharpshooters  The video footage of the incident showed Javed Butt in a pool of blood ‘dead on the spot’ while his wife was injured critically. She was shifted to a local hospital by police who reached the site on being alerted about the incident. The daylight-armed attack and sounds of heavy gunfire created a panic among the road users, forcing some of them to abandon their vehicles on the road and rush for shelter. The sources in the Lahore police believe that it may be a beginning of the new gang war between Teefi and Tipu gangs. They said both the families first clashed again when young Ameer Balaj, son of the late Tipu Truckanwala, was gunned down in a wedding ceremony in Chuhng area in January this year. Tipu’s family nominated Teefi, his cousin Khawaja Aqeel alias Gogi Butt and others in the case. Soon after the incident, Teefi Butt fled to the UK while Gogi Butt’s last location was reported to be in Karachi where he had gone underground. During the course of investigation, police arrested Ameer Balaj’s close friend, Ahsan Shah, for giving secret information to Teefi Butt and his gangsters about the movement of his friend. The sources said Ahsan Shah was allegedly murdered in an ‘encounter’ between the police team of the Organised Crime Unit (OCU), formerly the CIA, and the unidentified armed men a week back. The OCU claimed that Shah had planned to murder of OCU Sub-Inspector Shakeel Butt in jail and made public his mobile phone call he made from the jail. The sources said the murder of Shah in connection with the killing of Balaj threw the shadows of doubts on the mysterious role of some OCU police officials as the gangsters of the underworld believed that Shah was allegedly murdered in a ‘staged encounter’. The mystery surrounding the killing of Shah further deepened when conflicting reports regarding the beneficiary of his murder surfaced. Some reports suggested that the killing of the informer (Shah) would favour Teefi Butt, the prime suspect nominated in the Balaj’s murder case, who had hired Shah to get information of Balaj’s movement. However, the sources added, the murder of Teefi’s brother-in-law near the Canal Road baffled the police high-ups who had yet no clue about the network behind this assassination. The OCU is also investigating the role of Balaj’s family or his younger brother Ameer Mussab in the murder of Javed Butt. The sources claimed that Mussab was the complainant in the murder case of his brother Ameer Balaj and he had nominated Teefi and Gogi Butt in the FIR. Monday’s killing may take Balaj’s relatives to a defensive position if a case would be lodged against them. Lahore OCU DIG Imran Kishwar told Dawn the murder of Javed Butt put the police in a challenging situation as they were immediately unable to name anyone behind the killing. He said that the police teams were trying to get help from the Punjab Safe City Authority cameras to trace the alleged killers. To a question, he said that the OCU teams were exploring all other options as they feared that any ‘third party’ might have settled its score with Javed Butt by taking advantage of old rivalry between the Butt and Balaj families.

  "description": "GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee on Monday organised a protest rally against the misuse of Anti-Terrorism Act and cybercrime laws, saying these laws are being used by the government to silence the voice of people against injustices in the area and to curb freedom of expression. The rally was led by GB Awami Action Committee chairman Advocate Ehsan Ali, Baltistan division president Najaf Ali and senior leaders Baba Jan and Mumtaz Nagri. The participants of the rally marched on the River View road and assembled at the Central Press Club of Gilgit where the committee leaders addressed the participants of the rally. Speaking on the occasion, the committee leaders said that Anti-Terrorism Act and cybercrime laws are being misused by the government in the region. They said that fake cases have been registered against political workers and GB Awami Action Committee office-bearers under the Anti-Terrorism Act and cybercrime laws to silence their voices which are being raised for the rights of the people. They said that coercive actions against political workers would not be accepted and they would continue to use their right of freedom of speech. The GB government recently included the name of the Awami Action Committee chairman and others in the Fourth Schedule.      Najaf Ali, the president of the Awami Action Committee, Baltistan division, said they have been demanding the basic rights of the local people, uninterrupted provision of electricity and the local people’s right to have ownership of local lands. He said that instead resolving public issues, the Federal Investigation Agency has started registering fake cases against the local people. The speakers said that local bodies elections have not been held in the area for the last two decades and “land grabbing and issuance of licences for mineral exploration to non-locals continue in the area”. The protesters unanimously passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of cybercrime notices issued to political workers. The resolution also demanded the government to dismiss illegal cases registered against the GB Awami Action Committee office-bearers. Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2024 "

  "content": "The induction ceremony of warships PNS Babar and PNS Hunain into the fleet of Pakistan Navy will be held on the occasion of the Defence Day, which is observed in Pakistan on September 6. The military’s media wing said President Asif Ali Zardari will be the chief guest at the induction event. According to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), PNS Babar was built in Turkiye and PNS Hunain in Romania. The two warships will further boost Pakistan Navy's defence capabilities, it said. The media wing said construction of PNS Babar began on June 4, 2020, while it was launched on August 15, 2021, and its commissioning took place on September 23, 2023.  Four Babar class ships equipped with vertical launching system were being inducted into Pakistan Navy, said the statement.  Under Pak-Turkey agreement, two ships are being manufactured in Istanbul and as many in Karachi. It said three other Babar class ships PNS Badar, Tariq and Khyber were under construction. The Babar class ship is capable of surface, underwater and air combat, simultaneously, said the ISPR. “The 2,888-tonne Babar-class ship has a vertical launch system to deal with aerial threats. The vertical launch system of the 2888 ton Babar-class ship can hit air targets,” ISPR said. Meanwhile, recently commissioned third offshore patrol vessel (OPV) PNS Hunain arrived in Karachi from Romania, the Pakistan Navy (PN) director general public relations (DGPR) said on August 30. The DGPR said a ceremony was held at the PN Dockyard and Commodore Pakistan Fleet Vice Admiral Faisal Abbasi was the chief guest on this occasion. PNS Hunain is a multipurpose medium sized OPV, with state of the art electronic warfare, anti-ship, anti-air warfare weapons and sensors, self-protection and terminal defence system. The ship was built and commissioned in July this year at Romania’s Damen Shipyard. The Commodore Pakistan Fleet, on this occasion, highlighted that addition of PNS Hunain will significantly enhance PN capability of safeguarding maritime frontiers. He emphasised that induction of such multipurpose state of the art platforms would provide support to PN Maritime Security patrol in the Indian Ocean. Reception ceremony of PNS Hunain was attended by large number of PN officers, CPOs/sailors and families of crew members."

Taking to his official X account, PM Shehbaz said: \"Pakistan's annual inflation rate has dropped to 9.6% in August, the first single-digit figure in nearly 3 years according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\". On Monday, data from PBS revealed a significant drop in the inflation rate which has been exceeding the 20% mark since May 2022, peaking at a staggering 38% last May and these skyrocketing inflation rates coincided with the reforms implemented as part of a much-needed International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout programme. \"CPI general inflation increased to 9.6% on a year-on-year basis in August 2024 as compared to an increase of 11.1% in the previous month and 27.4% in August 2023\", the PBS said a day earlier. Reiterating the government's resolve to provide relief to the masses, the premier added: \"My focus is on providing relief to the common man. Our work is not done, and a lot more needs to be done but we are making real progress.\" It should be noted that on a month-on-month basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to 0.4% in August 2024 as compared to an increase of the previous month’s 2.1% and an increase of 1.7% in August 2023. According to data, CPI inflation in urban areas increased to 11.7% on a year-on-year basis as compared to an increase of 13.2% in the previous month and 25.0% in August 2023. On a month-on-month basis, it increased to 0.3% as compared to an increase of 2.0% in the previous month and an increase of 1.6% in August 2023. Meanwhile, CPI inflation in rural areas increased to 6.7% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in August 2024 as compared to an increase of 8.1% in the previous month and 30.9% in August 2023. On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, it increased to 0.6% in August 2024 as compared to an increase of 2.2% in the previous month and an increase of 1.9% in August 2023. Prices of food items that increased on an MoM basis included onions (22.84%), chicken (13.62%), eggs (12.39%), fresh vegetables (12.25%), besan (4.88%), pulse gram (4.55%), gram whole (3.82%), potatoes (2.90%), pulse moong (2.83%), milk fresh (1.27%), milk products (1.20%) and vegetable ghee (1.10%). It is to be noted that last month, Moody's Ratings has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 owing to improvement in macroeconomic conditions. The upgrade to Caa2 reflects Pakistan's improving macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions, from very weak levels. Accordingly, Pakistan's default risk has reduced to a level consistent with a Caa2 rating, as per Moody’s. \"There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of $7 billion.\" Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have about doubled since June 2023, although they remain below what is required to meet its external financing needs, it said. According to Moody's, the country remains reliant on timely financing from official partners to fully meet its external debt obligations.  The agency however warned that the \"Caa2 rating continues to reflect Pakistan's very weak debt affordability, which drives high debt sustainability risk\". "

  "content": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday castigated the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for its refusal to hold talks with political parties, saying that party founder Imran Khan wants dialogue with only establishment. Speaking on the National Assembly floor, the defence minister said that the former ruling party was begging for a \"NRO-like deal\" from the establishment. “[PTI spokesperson] Raoof Hasan is begging for an NRO from those who they believe wield real powers,” he said. His remarks came in response to Hasan’s interview to Voice of America (VOA), wherein the PTI leader \"hoped and prayed\" that the deadlock between the military and his party does not continue any longer. “In the interest of the state, it is imperative that PTI and the establishment engage in dialogue,” he said, adding that the party had not left any stone unturned to “end this stalemate”. The former ruling party has long maintained stance that it will only hold talks with the powers that be instead of the political parties.  Today, Asif said that Imran Khan “only wanted” to negotiate with the establishment and seeking the NRO, clarifying that the government has no objection to PTI’s desire to hold dialogue with the establishment. Over 12 years ago, on October 5, 2007, the-then president and army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, had promulgated the National Reconciliation Ordinance, which had granted amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, money laundering, murders and terrorism. However, the minister asked Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai — who had been tasked by PTI founder in this regard — will he hold negotiations with the establishment? “They [PTI] say Achakzai heads the opposition alliance [Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Ain-e-Pakistan] and he will negotiate,” he said, asking them to decide with whom they want to be engaged. Reminding the PTI that their past benefactor are no more in power, the defence minister said: “This is a new system with a new leadership.”  The defence minister said the embattled party is looking towards establishment for relief and reiterating negotiations with the Imran Khan-founded party cannot take place until they apologised for the May 9 mayhem. The May 9 incidents refer to the violent protests that broke out in many parts of the country following the arrest of Khan in a corruption case. The violent protests saw attacks on state properties including military installations, with the civil and military authorities vowing to try the rioters under the Army Act. Earlier in the day, Asif — while speaking during Geo News programme 'Naya Pakistan' — rejected media reports that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif directed his party to hold talks with all political parties including the PTI. \"We concentrated on two topics only during the meeting, one on holding local bodies elections in Punjab and the other on bringing down electricity prices,\" he said of the party meeting that took place a day earlier."

  "content": "   ISLAMABAD: Seeking an amendment to the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act, 1997, a bill was tabled in the Senate on Monday to increase the number of judges in the Supreme Court to 20 — other than the chief justice — to \"address the rising number of pending cases\". The bill titled \"Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act\", 2024, was presented by an independent senator from Balochistan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir. He sought the increase in the number of top court judges from 17 to 21 as \"more than 53,000 cases\" pending in the apex court. According to the bill, a copy of which is available with Geo News, the number of judges of the top court other than the chief justice shall be 20. It further stated: \"The Supreme Court has four jurisdictions original, appellate, advisory, and review being diverse and demanding, contributing to the continuous accumulation of cases.\" \"With economic growth and social changes, the complexity and variety of cases have increase,\" it pointed out. It stressed: \"This backlog, combined with the complexities of integrating the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, necessitates more judicial resources.\" Speaking on the floor of the upper house, Senator Abdul Qadir called for appointing \"at least 16 judges\" to the top court, saying that several constitutional matters were being referred to the top court. \"Larger benches are formed and these judges look into the constitutional matters,\" he added. Not only constitutional cases, but several cases related to financial matters worth billions were also pending in the top court as it does not have time to hear these cases, the senator claimed. \"Our judicial system is lowest on the [global] ranking,\" he added. However, the opposition senators opposed the new legislation. Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar also backed the legislation and suggested forwarding the new bill to the relevant committee. Tarar, while addressing the Senate session, endorsed the points raised by Senator Qadir, saying several cases pertaining to capital punishments still awaiting verdicts since 2015. “A person spent 34 years in jail due to a pending appeal before the top court,” he added. He further said that the architects of the Constitution of Pakistan have not fixed a specific number of judges and gave parliament power to determine the judicial strength. It is noteworthy to mention here that in a bid to reduce pendency of the cases, two retired judges — Justice (retd) Tariq Masood and Justice (retd) Mazhar Alam Miankhel — had been appointed as ad hoc judges to the apex court for a period of one year in July. The appointment of the retired jurists was recommended by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) two months ago which was later approved by President Asif Ali Zardari under Article 182 of the Constitution. In his remarks on the amendment, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Syed Ali Zafar said that the law was \"suddenly tabled\" in the the upper house to increase the number of jurists. He termed the amendments \"an attempt to impose a judicial martial law\" by bringing seven new judges. Zafar added that his party was ready to approve the appointment of two more judges. The senator suggested the government to start increasing the judicial strength from subordinate courts instead of the Supreme Court. He also alleged that Senator Qadir \"is being used\" for the new legislation which he said apparently going in favour of the coalition government. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told journalists earlier today that the party has decided to oppose any amendment bill regarding the judiciary and all their members of parliament have been officially notified about it. \"None of our MNA or senator will vote in the favour of the proposed amendments. Every MNA has been individually instructed in this regard in the light of Article 63 of the Constitution,\" Gohar said. Responding to the PTI’s opposition to the bill, Tarar in today's session said the former ruling party is worried over the proposed amendment as the bill would seize something, asking the opposition party to give logical reasons behind its apprehensions.  \"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) had sought an increase of 10 judges. The PTI is the ruling party there but we are still making the required appointments,\" he added. Taking part in the debate over the new legislation in the upper house of the parliament, Senator Aimal Wali Khan, the president of the Awami National Party (ANP), admitted that a judge cannot hear dozens of cases in a day. Expressing his concerns, Aimal questioned why the government is cherished over the opposition’s bill amid media reports questioning the requirements of additional judges. He was referring to the tabling of the said amendment by an independent senator instead of a government legislator. He also questioned the law minister regarding his pledge to introduce a bill on comprehensive legal reforms. He was of the view that the amendments related to increasing the number of judges could be included in the promised bill. The ANP president recommended the constitution of a separate court for constitutional amendments. Responding to Aimal's query, the law minister said that the federal government will introduce detailed reforms for subordinate courts in the coming days. Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred the bill to the relevant body of the upper house. The coalition government ruled by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has been facing criticism from the opposition parties for planning to introduce judiciary-centric legislation in the parliament. The Imran-founded party alleged that the recommended legislation could include the extension of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and changes in law regarding the appointments of SC judges based on the principle of seniority. However, the Centre has time and again denied these reports, saying that nothing as such was on the cards as CJP Isa has \"no interest\" in getting an extension. Refuting speculations on the seniority-based law for CJP’s appointment, Law Minister Tarar had said that the only criterion to be followed for the appointment of a new top judge is \"seniority\"."

  "description": "The military’s top brass on Tuesday vowed not to let “hard-earned successes” against terrorism go wasted in the wake of recent attacks in Balochistan. In the latest flare-up of violence, dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks last week across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.      At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives as militants went on a rampage across the province, storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles. In response, security forces neutralised 21 militants. Among those killed were 23 people in Musakhail, mostly labourers from Punjab, who were offloaded from trucks and vans and shot dead after an identity check. A press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir presided over the Corps Commanders’ Conference at the General Headquarters to discuss the prevailing geo-strategic environment, national security challenges, and strategic and operational responses to emerging threats. “In assessing the inimical forces, malicious actors, subversive proxies, and the facilitators of Pakistan’s external and internal adversaries, particularly those active in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the forum deliberated on a range of measures to neutralise these threats. “The forum reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the people, will not allow the hard-earned successes against terrorism to be reversed,” the ISPR said.         It added that recognising the “urgency and significance of a robust and effective legal system”, the army chief stressed that the army would continue to extend “comprehensive support to the government, administrative apparatus and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in taking swift and lawful action against terrorists, anarchists, and criminal mafias”.      The military officers also “expressed satisfaction over ongoing efforts against illegal spectrum operating in collusion with terrorist networks” and underscored the “critical need” to safeguard national cyberspace through “stringent cybersecurity measures”. The forum’s participants paid tribute to martyrs from the armed forces, LEAs, and citizenry who “laid down their lives in Balochistan and KP in pursuit of peace and stability of Pakistan”.      The army brass emphasised that the military was a “disciplined institution, upholding the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and loyalty” to the state and itself. “The institution’s well-established and rigorous system of accountability ensures that these values are preserved with unwavering commitment, allowing no room for exceptions or partiality. This strict adherence to accountability fortifies the army’s integrity, ensuring that no individual is above the law or exempt from scrutiny.” The conference’s participants also expressed solidarity with Kashmiris and honoured the resistance fighters and martyrs in Indian-occupied Kashmir while also strongly condemning the “blatant continued violence and genocide of Palestinians by Israel”. The ISPR said the huddle expressed confidence in the military’s operational preparedness and readiness and vowed to continue to “uphold the standards in pursuit of professional excellence”. Terrorist attacks surge to 59 in August from 38 in July The country continues to experience increased terrorist attacks as a total of 59 terrorist attacks occurred across the country in August 2024 compared to 38 such attacks in July. These incidents included 29 attacks in KP, 28 in Balochistan, and two in Punjab, killing 84 people and 166 others injured, according to the digital database of security incidents managed by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), an Islamabad-based think-tank. Balochistan experienced 28 terrorist incidents during August 2024, which resulted in 57 deaths and injuries to another 84 people. Most of these terrorism-related casualties in the province resulted from the banned BLA-orchestrated attacks on August 26 in over seven districts of the province targeting security forces, non-Baloch people (mainly Punjabis), and national infrastructure. In KP, 29 terrorist attacks took place, claiming 25 lives and wounding 80 others. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, Islamic State-Khorasan, and a few local Taliban groups reportedly carried out these attacks. Meanwhile, two reported attacks from Punjab injured two civilians; two of the attackers were also killed. Security forces and the counterterrorism departments of the police conducted 12 anti-militant operations in the country in August compared to 11 in July. In these operations, 88 militants were killed and 15 army soldiers and three policemen martyrdom. Eight out of the 12 reported operations took place in KP, while four others took place in Balochistan. Of the total 28 attacks recorded in Balochistan in August this year, 26 were carried out by the BLA, including the group’s extensive terrorist onslaught on August 26. PIPS in its monthly security report said that the armed group has escalated its destructive activities, executing high-impact attacks and using female suicide bombers. On August 26, the anniversary of Baloch chieftain Nawab Akbar Bugti’s death, the group launched coordinated attacks across Balochistan. The report underlines that the involvement of numerous militants and the use of sophisticated weaponry including vehicle-borne explosives, indicate the BLA’s growing capabilities. The group has adopted new tactics, such as targeting Punjabis on highways by checking identity cards — a development that may further strain relations between the province and the central government, which seems to be one of the banned entity’s objectives. Positioning itself as a defender of Baloch interests, the BLA exploits grievances like enforced disappearances and resource exploitation. As the Baloch people lose faith in the political process, the group may gain more support. "

  "description": "A woman police officer in Karachi was suspended for posting a TikTok video while on duty and revealing her team’s location, a notification by Sindh Police said on Wednesday. Police Constable (PC) Maria Gill, posted at the Gizri Police Station District South, Karachi, was suspended with immediate effect “due to improper and irresponsible behaviour towards performance of official duties at place of deployment, leading to negligence and dereliction of duty,” said the notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com. In the video, seen by Dawn.com, she could be heard saying: “Hello guys, Assalamoalikum. Today, I am posted for duty at the Mai Kolachi Road outside Bahria College. “As you can see, there’s a heavy police presence here,” she says while pointing towards four other police officers seated at a bus stop. One of the officers could be seen waving at the camera as Gill captured them in the video. She then gestured to her motorcycle parked next to her. “Whoever wants to meet me, you can come here and meet me. I am posted on duty here today,” she said while saying goodbye. The notification was issued by Syed Asad Raza, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) South Zone. It added that Gill would undergo a counselling session conducted by Station House Officer Women South Zone. She would also be shifted to Police Headquarters South Zone, where she would have to “attend daily roll call/parade,” the notification said. “She shall draw pay and allowances as admissible under the rules,” the notification said. Speaking to Dawn.com, DIG South Raza said a report of Gill has been sought by the senior superintendent of police. “The police is a professional organisation and no one can be allowed to engage in such irresponsible acts,” he said. Separately, a later statement from the city police said PC Zeeshan shot a video in 2022 and uploaded it to TikTok in 2023, adding that he was suspended and ordered to report to the SSP City Office. The video doing the rounds on social media also showed him handling his gun. “No police constable will be allowed to play with or use weapons in this way. Zero tolerance policy will be adopted against any officer or constable who commits such act and strict departmental action will be taken against him. This order is for all those officers and employees who upload videos with official uniforms and official weapons,” the statement said. In July, a Chiniot policeman was suspended from service for facilitating a transgender person for making a TikTok video in the SHO office. District Police Officer Abdullah Ahmad took notice of a TikTok video that went viral on social media in which a transgender is seen sitting in the official chair of the SHO in the Chiniot City Police Station and recording a video.

  "description": "Sardar Akhtar Mengal, chief of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), resigned from the National Assembly on Tuesday. Mengal was elected as an MNA from Khuzdar (NA-256) in the general elections held on February 8. The veteran politician’s resignation — which awaits acceptance — comes amid heightened security tensions in Balochistan after recent deadly attacks and increased protests over past months against enforced disappearances. In a letter addressed to NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Mengal said the “prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled me to take this step”. “Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further against the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles. “The lack of genuine representation in this Assembly for the people of Balochistan has left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change. “It has become increasingly clear that our attempts to speak or protest are met with hostility, our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed,” Mengal wrote in his letter. “Under such circumstances, I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,” Mengal wrote. Requesting the NA speaker to accept his resignation, the BNP-M chief expressed the hope for Balochistan to “be protected and prosper”. While speaking to the press outside Parliament, Mengal acknowledged that “thousands of voters would be upset with me but I apologise to them.” He said that the murder of anyone in the country —be it someone who is Urdu-speaking, Pashto, or Baloch — was carried out by the judiciary for not providing justice. “The biggest murderers are politicians who have made a business out of politics,” Mengal said. He said that in a meeting at the Prime Minister House on July 23, he conveyed that if there was no need for him in politics, so he would leave. “It is better to open a shop of pakoras than to do such politics,” Mengal quipped. “The person who guided me has passed away,” he said. “I did not attend his funeral and have come here instead to talk, yet, no one listened to me.” Meanwhile, in a post on X, Mengal termed his resignation a “tribute” to his father, BNP founder Sardar Attaullah Mengal. “On the third death anniversary of my father, Sardar Attaullah Mengal, I resign as a member of Parliament as a tribute to him,” Mengal wrote in a post on X. He reiterated that the prevailing situation in Balochistan had compelled him to make the decision. “Under these circumstances, I find it impossible to act any longer in this capacity, because my presence here has not been of any benefit to the people I represent,” the post read.         While Mengal had chosen not to cast a vote in the election for the prime minister this year, he had supported PTI-backed Mahmood Khan Achakzai in the presidential polls in March. In April, the BNP-M chief had also presided over a meeting of six opposition parties, where they decided to launch their movement Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). "

  "description": "Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan on Tuesday petitioned the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against his possible military custody for the trials under way against him related to the May 9 cases. Countrywide protests erupted on May 9 last year after the paramilitary Rangers whisked away Imran from the IHC in a corruption case. While the protests were underway, social media was flooded with footage of rioting and vandalism at various spots, including the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence and General Headquarters, the army’s head of office in Rawalpindi. The already incarcerated former prime minister was “arrested” in these cases on July 15 — just a day after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been apprehended in a new Toshakhana case, following their acquittal in the Iddat case. Imran has previously claimed that there is a plan to try him in the military court. He had also said that arrested former intelligence chief Gen (retired) Faiz Hameed was being forced to turn approver against him to pave the way for his trial in a military court on May 9 cases.      Government spokesperson for legal affairs Barrister Aqeel Malik earlier hinted that Imran’s May 9 cases might go to the military courts. However, the Punjab government said last week there was currently no proposal under consideration to send his case to a military court. Imran submitted a petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, to the IHC today under Article 199 of the Constitution, under which a high court may take up a matter when there is “no other adequate remedy is provided by law.” The petition mentioned the Islamabad inspector general (IG) of police, Punjab chief secretary, Punjab IGs for police and prisons, Adiala Jail superintendent, Federal Investigation Agency director general, and the interior, defence, and law secretaries as respondents. The petition said that since the Lahore High Court (LHC) quashed Imran’s physical remand in the May 9 cases, “reports have been circulating on television, print, and social media that the petitioner will be shifted to the custody of army authorities in connection with the cases regarding the events of May 9 and 10, 2023. “Many observers and commentators have expressed the view that the army authorities will take the petitioner into custody and try him before a court martial.” It argued that Imran’s apprehensions were lent credence by Barrister Malik’s remarks, adding that it would be a “complete travesty of justice and due process” if Imran was handed over to the military since it would be going against a Supreme Court verdict that the trial of civilians through a court martial was unconstitutional. “There is a genuine possibility that the army authorities will take the petitioner into custody. The brazenly illegal and unconstitutional manner in which he … has been treated by state authorities over the last two years … make this a real concern. Such action will also frustrate and undermine the aforesaid relief granted to the petitioner by the honourable LHC as well as the bails granted to him,” the petition said. It further maintained that the instant matter was of “immense public importance as it has a direct bearing on the state of rule of law in the country and involves questions of the petitioner’s rights, especially those concerning liberty, fair trial, due process, and dignity”. The petition pleaded that the respondents be restrained from handing over Imran to military custody and ordered to ensure that he is kept in civilian custody, subject to the jurisdiction of civilian courts. A separate petition that prayed for the same relief said: “The balance of convenience lies heavily in favour of the applicant. The respondents will not suffer any inconvenience if the interim relief prayed for is granted. However, the applicant will suffer grave inconvenience if the army authorities get his custody since he will stand deprived of many of his fundamental rights. There is also the apprehension that he will be manhandled. “That in the event that the relief prayed for in the instant application is not granted, the applicant will suffer irreparable loss as his fundamental rights will be infringed in violation of the judgment of the Supreme Court […] Such loss of liberty and other fundamental rights cannot be compensated in terms of money or in any other manner.” "

  "description": "Five children died across Balochistan while four people lost their lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the past day as monsoon rains continued to wreak havoc countrywide, officials said on Tuesday. Deaths mount countrywide as various areas continue to receive monsoon showers along with the remnants of cyclonic storm Asna that brought with it heavy rains for Sindh and Balochistan. Since July 1, a total of 39 people have died in Balochistan in rain-related incidents, Younus Mengal, head of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority’s control room, (PDMA) told Dawn.com. The deceased include 19 children, five of whom died in three separate incidents on Monday, Mengal said. The PDMA official said a “new spell of rain entered Balochistan a day ago and was expected to continue till tonight in 22 districts.” Relief and rescue efforts were under way in the province, he added. Detailing the deadly incidents, Mengal said a pair of brothers drowned in flashfloods in Zhob District, and their bodies were recovered by the district administration and the PDMA. In Khuzdar District’s Tootak area, three children were “immediately rescued” by Levies officials after they fell into a dam but were taken to a hospital, where two of them passed away, the official said. A fifth minor, Mengal added, drowned in a flash flood passing by the Kech River in Kech District. The PDMA official confirmed that 11 Balochistan districts have been declared calamity-hit as of yet, where the authority’s aid efforts were under way. Mengal further said that in view of alerts by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), holidays of PDMA and other government employees had been suspended. According to a PDMA report issued on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, 17 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across Balochistan from July 1 to September 1. Some 895 houses have been completely damaged while more than 14,000 have been partially damaged during the period, with Khuzdar and Jaffarabad being the most affected. Over 111,400 people province-wide have been affected by the rains as seven bridges, 74 kilometres of roads and seven medical health units have been left damaged. On the agricultural side, 58,830 acres of crop have been affected while 373 livestock have perished so far. 4 killed in KP over past day; KKH reopened Meanwhile, four people lost their lives as heavy rainfalls lashed parts of KP during the last 24 hours, a report issued by PDMA spokesperson Anwar Shahzad said.    A tractor stands at the Karakoram Highway in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sept 3, 2024. — Photo via Umar Bacha  The PDMA said that three people died after a bus was struck by a landslide in Upper Kohistan, while a minor was struck by lightning in Malakand District. Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which had been blocked last night due to heavy downpours, was reopened for all kinds of traffic on Tuesday. Several vehicles, including a bulldozer, were stuck on Monday night due to landslide debris brought by the flooding water in the Shukryat area of Upper Kohistan. The clearance of the road today allowed stranded passengers to leave for their destinations. National Highway Authority (NHA) Deputy Director Ghulam Abbas confirmed to Dawn.com that the road was blocked at the Dasu area but now was reopened for all traffic. He said the vehicles stuck in the floods (mudslides) had also been pulled out from the debris. Reiterating the same, Upper Kohistan District Police Officer Mukhtiar Ahmad, said vehicles stranded on both sides had left for their destinations safely. The PDMA report said that the scenic tourist hotspot, Kumrat Valley Road in Upper Dir’s Thal area, was blocked after parts of it caved in after massive floods hit the area. It added that authorities in Upper Dir and other districts had been asked to reopen the roads for traffic at the earliest and establish alternate routes for commuters. The report further said 96 people had died and 133 were injured across KP in rain-related incidents from July 1 to September 2 (Monday). A total of 963 houses had been damaged due to flash floods and heavy downpours during the period. Shahzad, the PDMA official, said that relief activities had been launched in the affected areas and the authority was in close liaison with the district authorities. Punjab witnesses heavy showers; Sindh residents brace for more rain Meanwhile, Lahore also witnessed rain today as the weather turned pleasant. Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed instructed the agency to remain alert after instruction from specific instructions from Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. A statement from the Punjab PDMA said there was a possibility of rain in most of the districts in the next 24 hours with the spell forecast to continue till Wednesday. It said that due to the rains in the upper areas, there was a fear of the flow of water increasing in the rivers with the upstream water flow in the Jhelum River expected to increase till Wednesday. The PDMA said there was a risk of low-level floods in the Indus River, while there was a risk of flooding in the rivers adjacent to the Chenab and Ravi rivers. Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the current flow of water in all rivers and canals was at a normal level. He said there was moderate flooding in Dera Ghazi Khan. Furthermore, the water level in the Mangala Dam was as 80 per cent and 100pc in the Tarbela Dam. A weekly outlook issued by the PMD said that monsoon currents from the Bay of Bengal were penetrating the upper and central parts of the country, which could result in heavy rains today in those regions. Rainfall records for the past 24 hours upto 8am today showed that Lahore continued to receive heavy rainfall, with Wasa gauges measuring 201 millimetres of rain at Nishtar Town. Gujranwala witnessed 196mm of rain at Model Town over the past day, Wasa records showed. In Balochistan, 22mm of showers were recorded in Ziarat while 13mm in Kalat during the same period. Rawalakot in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) received 47mm of rain while the highest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 18mm, was measured in Dera Ismail Khan. Sindh recorded no rainfall in the past 24 hours, the PMD update stated. However, Sindh residents, including those in Karachi, braced for more monsoon showers, which were expected to continue till tomorrow. According to an alert issued by the PMD today, monsoon currents were penetrating into eastern Sindh. Under their influence, “isolated thunderstorm/rain may occur in Karachi Division tomorrow”, the Met Office said. Thunderstorms/rain with few moderate to isolated heavy falls were likely in Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar, Badin, Thatta, Jamshoro, Dadu, Matiari, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad and Khairpur districts today and tomorrow with occasional gaps, the PMD said. It added that thunderstorms/rains were likely in Ghotki, Sukkur, Kashmore, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Larkana, Kambar Shahdadkot and Naushahro Feroze districts today and tomorrow with occasional gaps.      For Karachi Division, the PMD said weather was likely to remain “partly cloudy and humid” during the next three days, with “chances of isolated rain/thunderstorm” on Wednesday. Maximum temperatures were expected to stay between 32-34 degrees Celsius from today till Thursday (September 5) while at night, the mercury was forecast to fall as low as 25°C. Heavy showers last week have left Karachi’s roads damaged, leading to concerns and criticism from opposition lawmakers in Sindh Assembly. "

  "description": "Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and United States Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome on Tuesday discussed the protection of Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in Pakistan amid several other bilateral issues during a meeting in Islamabad, a statement from the US Embassy said. A large number of Afghan immigrants, with an estimated 1.7 million undocumented as of October 2023, reside in Pakistan.  Last year, the then caretaker government announced the repatriation of all illegal foreigners citing security concerns. The decision was allegedly made for Afghan refugees,  but officials denied it. According to a statement issued by US Mission spokesperson Jonathan Lalley, US Ambassador Blome met Deputy Prime Minister Dar today and discussed issues which included the “protection of Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, economic cooperation, security, and counterterrorism and regional cooperation”. It said that the ambassador welcomed the opportunity to hear from the deputy premier on Pakistan’s “priorities in the lead-up to the UN General Assembly” as the country prepared to begin its term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC).      Pakistan launched the first round of deportation in November last year, and according to state-run Radio Pakistan, 675,190 Afghans have returned to their country as of August 4 under the drive. While the government had decided to begin the second round of repatriation of holders of Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC), it last month granted 1.45m Afghan refugees another year, extending their permitted stay in Pakistan till June 30, 2025. Meanwhile, the Joint Action Committee for Refugees urged the government to “remember that ordinary Afghans in Pakistan are not security threats … but ordinary families who have made Pakistan their home or themselves fled the Taliban”. It said the government must push the West to take its share of asylum-seekers and refugees, and to speed up processing so that families could be reunited within Pakistan. “Hastily announced expulsion programmes only result in harm to families and individuals who are a part Pakistan.”         Enhanced bilateral cooperation Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the discussion between Dar and Blome covered various aspects of the bilateral relationship between the countries, including avenues for enhanced cooperation in diverse fields. “They also discussed matters relating to the upcoming session of the UN General Assembly,” the FO said. Pakistan was elected with a massive majority as a non-permanent member of the UNSC last month, pledging to contribute to meeting the challenges that the world was facing.      Pakistan will replace Japan on January 1, 2025, to begin a record eighth term, which would continue for two years. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will arrive in New York on September 21 to participate in the UN-sponsored Summit of the Future and the UN General Assembly session. The debate at the UNGA will begin on Sept 24 and run through Sept 28. PM Shehbaz is slated to address the General Assembly on Sept 27, the day following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address. The discussions are expected to focus on the Gaza crisis. Following its election to the UN Security Council earlier this year, Pakistan has amplified its role in addressing concerns related to Gaza and Kashmir. During his visit, PM Shehbaz will also hold bilateral meetings with various world leaders to discuss mutual interests. He will attend the annual reception hosted by the US president and engage with prominent members of the Pakistani-American community. "

  "content": "KARACHI: Two cops including a lady police constable were suspended for exhibiting irresponsible behaviour while on duty after their videos went viral on the internet, Geo News reported on Tuesday. After her video of posing in front of camera on duty recently went viral, the action against Lady Police Constable Maria Gill was taken and drew South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Asad Raza's attention.  The lady cop was posted at the Gizri Police Station.  Similarly, a video of Constable Zeeshan, which was uploaded online in 2023 also went viral on social media recently, triggering action against him. City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz took notice of the matter and directed Constable Zeeshan to report to the City SSP office. The suspended young policeman, who was posted at Baghdadi Police Station, was seen posing with his pistol in uniform.  \"Police constable Zeeshan uploaded the video on TikTok in 2023,\" the City SSP said.  \"No officer will be allowed to play with or display weapons [in videos],\" he added. In view of discipline and work ethics, the authorities took action against the two police constables laying importance on professionalism, especially during duty. Expressing disappointment over the videos by the constables, the Sindh inspector general of police (IGP) emphasised that the police is a professional institution and directed other police officials that no one is allowed to engage in such irresponsible acts.  He warned that any police personnel found posing with their weapons and uploading these videos or images will be suspended and a departmental action will be carried out against them.  It may be noted that the government earlier in the day issued directives barring all public servants from using social media without permission to prevent disclosure of official information and documents. According to an office memorandum issued by the Establishment Division, government employees have been legally bound to adhere to the instruction under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964. In the wake of the order, government servants will no longer be allowed to use any social media application without permission. "

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After the Senate's Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs sought details of internal and the 2024 general elections' expenditures, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) excused itself from providing relevant information. The Senate body's session was held under the chair of Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand on Tuesday sought details of the salaries of the ECP members and employees, as well as their travel expenses and the expenditures for the 2024 general elections. However, ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan sent a letter to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, a copy of which is available with Geo News, stating that the upper house's standing committee was exceeding its jurisdiction by questioning the commission's expenditures \"which is 'charged' against Federal Consolidated Fund\". \"ECP is not obliged to provide the requisite information,\" the commission's secretary stated in a letter, saying that it is an \"independent constitutional body\" unlike other ministries, divisions, and its associated public bodies. It added that the poll organising authority was neither representing the federal government nor any provincial government and is therefore, outside the purview of the Senate body on parliamentary affairs. \"Accordingly, the budget allocated to the Election Commission is not voted in the National Assembly for inclusion in the Annual Budget Statement as provided in Article 82(1) ibid,\" it read. The ECP also stated that it is ready to assist the parliamentary body on legislative business pertaining to the election laws and constitutional provisions, as per its defined role. Responding to the letter, the committee chairman Senator Mohmand lamented that the ECP was stating that it was not answerable to parliament that \"established it\". The chairman added that the Senate body, as per the rules, has powers to summon any individual including the chief election commissioner (CEC) and ECP officials besides reviewing documents and records. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Mohsin Aziz demanded the Senate body to reject the ECP's letter and reminded that the commission's representatives had appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in the past. To this, parliamentary affairs' secretary said that the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs was only authorised to look into legislative affairs of the ECP and suggested that guidance should be sought from the Senate chairman on the matter. In November 2022, the commission had approved over Rs47 billion for organising general polls. However, the cost of holding nationwide polls in phases soared to Rs61.805 billion from Rs47.417 billion, with an additional amount of Rs14.388 billion sought by the commission from the Finance Ministry in January last year, The News had reported."

  "content": "A video has surfaced in which a terrorist associated with outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Rooh Ullah, revealed that injections were administered to the attackers to numb them a few days before their departure for the terror attacks. In a video statement, the detained terrorist made revelations about his and other suicide bombers' training in a seminary in Afghanistan and how they infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border via facilitators. He was caught by security forces who along with other suicide bombers illegally crossed the Afghan border to enter Pakistan to carry out bombings in a cantonment area. However, the terror plot was foiled by security personnel via timely action. The terrorist, in his statement, said that he was a student of a seminary — Tarteel-ul-Quran — in Tortam village in Afghanistan's Dangam for one year. He said that the seminary gives training to suicide bombers and he also received training for 10 days. Molvi Sibghatullah along with Farooq and Zakir taught them about suicide bombings in the seminary, said Rooh Ullah. He also revealed that injections were administered to the attackers two days before their departure [for the missions] to numb them, after which they could no longer comprehend what was happening around them. After the completion of their training, Rooh Ullah along with four others were transported to Batish village of Nari district in a green-coloured vehicle and later they started travelling to the Afghan border. He said that a facilitator namely Jawad received the group of suicide bombers who helped them to enter Pakistani territory and after that, responsibility for the group's next destination was handed over to another man — Sajjad. According to the arrested terrorist, two suicide bombers including Sajid and Abid were separated from them and Sajjad took him to a mosque.  The handler had instructed him to meet another person Suleman on a bridge. After travelling for one hour, they reached a tunnel where he and Suleman separated again. He said that Suleman had asked him to receive a suicide vest from Jameel who would also guide him about carrying out an attack in a cantonment area. He further said that he was given directions to ride a truck but he was immediately arrested by security forces after entering the vehicle. However, he did not disclose details of which areas they were going to target and from where he got arrested in a raid. Pakistan witnessed a surge in terror activities over the past few months, particularly in its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan provinces, for which the government and military blamed the terrorists operating from Afghan soil to launch cross-border attacks inside the country. Islamabad has time and again urged the Kabul administration to take decisive action against the terror outfits involved in targeting security forces and civilians in Pakistan.  The federal government, intending to cope with rising terrorism, including cross-border infiltration, launched operation \"Azm-e-Istehkam,\" a renewed national anti-terror drive as part of the National Action Plan earlier this year in June. In another move to shift its war on terror from a physical to an ideological front, the government had categorised the outlawed TTP as \"Fitna al-Khawarij\" in July. The government also made it mandatory for all institutions to use \"Khariji\" before the names of perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan, according to a notification issued by the Ministry of Interior. According to the notification, titles such as 'Mufti' and 'Hafiz' will not be used for individuals associated with terrorist organisations, while in all correspondence and documents, the term \"Khariji\" will be written and read before their names."

  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Another bill seeking to strengthen the number of Supreme Court judges was introduced in the National Assembly on Tuesday, a day after a similar legislation was tabled in the Senate. A day earlier, independent Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir presented 'The Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Bill, 2024' in the upper house to increase the number of apex court judges to 21. In the bill tabled today in the lower house, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) parliamentarian Daniyal Chaudhry called for increasing the number of judges to 23. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill tabled in the Senate say that increasing the number of judges in the apex court is important because it deals with a significant backlog of cases. The proposed legislation was met with criticism from PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan in today's NA session, said that such an amendment could be brought only by the government as per the Constitution of Pakistan. \"Legislation on the number of Supreme Court judges cannot be done through a private member bill,\" Khan said. The PTI lawmaker said that the country's top court works 155 days of the year compared to India's apex court, which works 190 days of the year. \"We should increase the Supreme Court's working days to address the rising number of pending cases,\" he added. Speaking on the floor of the assembly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar concurred with the PTI chief’s suggestion to increase the number of top court’s working days, saying that the duration of the apex court judges’ annual holidays should be curtailed. He said that formerly the judges used to embark on long ship voyages to Britain so the apex courts had 60 days holidays twice a year. \"Now these holidays should be reduced,\" he said, adding that the number of apex court judges is still 17 while the population of Pakistan has soared to over 240 million. He, however, revealed that the government has not yet made a final decision on increasing the number of Supreme Court judges and the matter will be decided after a detailed deliberation."

  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Top military commanders on Tuesday vowed to neutralise the threats posed by “inimical forces”, pledging that the Pakistan Army would not let hard-earned successes against terrorism be reversed.  A resolve to this effect was agreed upon during the Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, presided over by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). In assessing the inimical forces, malicious actors, subversive proxies, and the facilitators of Pakistan’s external and internal adversaries, particularly those active in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the top commanders deliberated on a range of measures to neutralise these threats. “The forum reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the people, will not allow the hard-earned successes against terrorism to be reversed,” it added. Pakistan's armed forces launched intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in the southwestern Balochistan province in response to attacks by insurgents that martyred over 50 people on August 26, the ISPR said last week. The military’s media wing said 21 insurgents were killed and three others wounded in the three operations launched in the province. \"Operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these atrocious acts are brought to justice,\" the army had said in a statement. Moreover, security forces neutralised at least 12 terrorists in IBOs conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Tirah Valley, according to ISPR. \"Since August 20, 2024, security forces are conducting extensive IBOs in Tirah Valley, Khyber District, on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" the ISPR said in a statement. During the meeting, the military top brass emphasised that the army was a disciplined institution, upholding the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and loyalty to the state and institution. “The institution's well-established and rigorous system of accountability ensures that these values are preserved with unwavering commitment, allowing no room for exceptions or partiality,” the meeting stressed, adding, “This strict adherence to accountability fortifies the Army’s integrity, ensuring that no individual is above the law or exempt from scrutiny.” Recognising the urgency and significance of a robust and effective legal system, the COAS emphasised that the Pakistan Army would continue to extend comprehensive support to the government, administrative apparatus, and law enforcement agencies in taking swift and lawful action against terrorists, anarchists, and criminal mafias. The forum expressed satisfaction over ongoing efforts against illegal spectrum operating in collusion with terrorist networks, underscoring the critical need to safeguard national cyberspace through stringent cybersecurity measures. In a show of solidarity with the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), who continue to suffer gross human rights violations, the forum honoured the martyrs of the freedom movement. The blatant continued violence and genocide of Palestinians by Israel were also condemned in the strongest terms. The forum expressed confidence in the operational preparedness and readiness of the Pakistan Army and vowed to continue to uphold the standards in pursuit of professional excellence, according to the ISPR."

  "content": "Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal on Tuesday tendered his resignation as a member of the National Assembly after witnessing the \"worsening situation\" of the province which has recently been marred by back-to-back terror attacks.  Mengal announced his resignation during the NA session today, saying he made this decision after witnessing the situation in Balochistan, adding that he declares no confidence in the state, the president and the prime minister. Regretting that he could not do anything for the people of the province, the politician said they had not been given the right to rule for a year and that he had a lack of trust in the whole system. \"People are not interested in the issues of Balochistan and every time this issue is raised, we face a blackout,\" he said. \"This assembly does not listen to us, what's the point of sitting here?\" Speaking to Geo News, Mengal said that the decision is made by his conscience. He questioned where they would go when the roads to the Parliament House were all blocked. Mengal, who was elected from the NA-256 constituency, said the prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled him to take this step. \"Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further to the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles. The lack of genuine representation in this assembly for the people of Balochistan has left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change,\" said the resignation letter. Mengal said that their attempts to speak or protest are \"met with hostility. Our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed.\" \"I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,\" he said. The politician's decision comes in the wake of the province's worsening law and order situation. Balochistan, on August 26, was marred by a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In one of the deadliest attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised."

According to an office memorandum issued by the Establishment Division, government employees have been legally bound to adhere to the instruction under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964. In the wake of the order, government servants will no longer be allowed to use any social media application without permission. \"Government employees cannot express opinions or facts that affect the reputation of the government,\" read the memorandum, adding that employees are not allowed to speak against government policy, decisions, national sovereignty and dignity. It added that public servants cannot express their opinions or rhetoric on social media without permission, while strict action will be taken against them for violating the instructions. The memorandum stated that a government servant cannot share official documents and information with unrelated persons. It maintained that employees cannot speak to the media in a way that affects relations with other countries. \"Civil servants have often been seen debating on social media. The guidelines are not intended to ban the positive use of social media,\" it read.

  "content": "The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)’s three-day annual convention has concluded in Dallas, United States of America, with more than 20,000 people attending the event where discussions were held on faith, services and global issues. The registration limit of 20,000 was reached by the second day, forcing the ISNA hosts to stop further registrations. Resultantly, scores of people could not attend the convention.  On the final day, various activities continued, where experts shared their thoughts on important topics. In particular, a seminar on the 'Blasphemy Law' was held, where experts declared the law contrary to Sharia, providing arguments from the Quran and Hadith. The convention addressed a wide range of topics, including women's issues, youth affairs, and general life problems in the United States, as well as international issues and their solutions. These sessions were designed to help attendees benefit from the practical expertise of specialists. During the convention, awards were presented to doctors who, driven by a spirit of humanitarian service, provided their services in Gaza. A significant number of Pakistani doctors were among those who received the awards. On this occasion, Dr Suleman Lalani, a member of the Texas State Assembly, stated that it is crucial to determine our direction, and making the right choice is vital to be remembered in history. He praised the community doctors who, with a strong sense of service, went to Gaza to provide medical assistance to the oppressed people. One of the award recipients, Dr Ikram, shared his emotional experience, stating that the miserable condition of the Palestinian people was deeply distressing, but despite the oppression, he did not see traces of sorrow on their faces. He mentioned that the smiles on their faces are something he will never forget. Dr Ikram's wife, Banish Ikram, mentioned that their entire family fully supported him in going to Gaza, and they are pleased to have contributed in some way to helping the oppressed Muslims of Gaza. On the last day of the convention, various sports and recreational programmes were organised. A poetry session (Mushaira) was also arranged, featuring poets from India and Pakistan. Renowned Pakistani poet Abbas Tabish presented his poetry and received immense appreciation. The session was presided over by the famous poet Noor Amrohvi. Poets from Kashmir, including Dr Tauqeer Gilani, Tariq Hashmi, Ayub Faizan Haq, Wasif Hussain, Fareed Sheikh, Rizwan Hasni, Sheikh Ejaz, and Ahmed Shah Ghazali, were also invited. The ISNA bazaar was bustling with people shopping at the stalls, with a large number of men and women making purchases. The companies that set up stalls also benefited significantly from this convention. The convention organised by the ISNA in Dallas was historic, with record attendance, contributing to its success. Azhar Aziz, a former president of ISNA from Dallas, played a significant role in the success of this convention."

  "content": "    KARACHI: As Pakistan teeters in its struggle to overcome several challenges including economic instability and political unrest, terrorism adds to the country's woes as the terror incidents witnessed a surge last month. The nation has been reeling under rising violent attacks since the Taliban rulers returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, particularly in the bordering provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.  The two most vulnerable provinces saw a sharp rise in deadly attacks last month, according to data from the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The digital database of security incidents managed by the Islamabad-based think-tank suggested an alarming situation as the number of attacks jumped from 38 in July to 59 in August. These incidents included 29 attacks in KP, 28 in Balochistan, and two in Punjab. The most recent and deadliest among the 28 attacks in the southwestern province resulted in 57 deaths and injuries to another 84 people. Meanwhile, KP witnessed 25 casualties in the 29 terrorist attacks during August. \"The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and few local Taliban groups were reportedly involved in these attacks,\" the report stated. Moreover, two civilians were reportedly killed in as many attacks in Punjab during the same period. As per the PIPS, most of these terrorism-related casualties in the province resulted from BLA-orchestrated attacks on August 26 in over seven districts of the province targeting security forces and national infrastructure. The PIPS statistics suggest that the security forces of Pakistan and the counterterrorism departments (CTDs) of police conducted 12 anti-militant operations in the country in August 2024. The number is over 50% higher than the 11 operations that took place in July. The operations in August \"resulted in the elimination of 88 militants\", and martyrdom of 15 soldiers and three policemen. The report highlighted that out of the total 28 attacks recorded in Balochistan in August 2024, 26 were carried out by the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), including the group's extensive terrorist onslaught on August 26. The terrorist outfit has reportedly escalated its destructive activities, executing high-impact attacks, including female suicide bombers. \"The involvement of numerous militants and the use of sophisticated weaponry, including vehicle-borne explosives, indicate the BLA’s growing capabilities,\" the report stated. The dastardly attacks sent shock waves across the country, drawing condemnations from the government and foreign countries. Condemning the attacks, Pakistan's long-time regional ally China and United States pledged support to the country in its fight against terrorism. Besides the recent spike in terrorism, Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since the Taliban government returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, mostly in KP and Balochistan, which abuts Afghanistan and Iran. In 2023, there were at least 170 militant attacks killing 151 civilians and 114 security personnel in Balochistan, as per the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Against this backdrop, the federal cabinet in June this year approved Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a reinvigorated national counter-terrorism campaign following the Central Apex Committee's recommendations under the National Action Plan to root out terrorism."

  "content": "  Pakistan's Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) on Tuesday reported multiple casualties and injuries across the provinces following recent monsoon downpours that brought life to a standstill and caused both residential and infrastructural damage in urban and rural areas. At least 10 people have succumbed to rain and flood-related incidents, while seven others sustained injuries in different parts of the country over the past few days. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), four people died and one was injured during the past 24 hours. Three of the deaths were caused by a landslide triggered by downpours in Upper Kohistan.  The fourth death was reported in Malakand, where, tragically, a child died due to a lightning strike. Since July 1st, the northwestern province has reported 96 deaths and 133 injuries in numerous rain-related incidents. Meanwhile, Sindh PDMA reported five deaths and two injuries in the past 24 hours in the province.  The area wise break-up of casualties suggested that one female drowned to death in Umerkot, two died in Larkana — one died of electrocution while another died in a house collapse. Meanwhile, two people were injured.   Moreover, Tando Allahyar also reported two deaths, one due to electrical shock, the other died in a wall collapse incident. According to its respective PDMA, Balochistan has been the hardest hit during the monsoon, with five deaths reported on Monday due to the ongoing rains. The disaster watchdog reported that rains had caused significant damage in the province since July 1st, while 34 people have lost their lives and 17 have been injured. With more than 15,000 houses severely damaged, Balochistan — the largest but least populated province in the country — has been the worst hit so far. Fortunately, Punjab has not suffered any rain-related casualties in the last 24 hours. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned that humid winds from the Bay of Bengal are expected to sweep across the upper regions of Pakistan, bringing more torrential storms until September 5.  According to the Met Office, the new system may also bring rain to some parts of Sindh, including Hyderabad, Thatta, Tharpakar, Mithi, and Badin, by tomorrow (Tuesday) while Karachi is likely to get light and heavy rain on September 4.

  "content": "KARACHI: Two cops including a lady police constable were suspended by  the Sindh Police higher-ups for irresponsible behaviour after their videos garnered attention on the internet, Geo News reported on Tuesday.  The action against Lady Police Constable Maria Gill was taken after her video of posing in front of camera on duty recently went viral and drew South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Asad Raza's attention.  The lady cop was posted at the Gizri Police Station.  Meanwhile, a video of Constable Zeeshan, which was uploaded online in 2023 also went viral on social media recently, triggering action against him.  City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz took notice of the matter and directed Constable Zeeshan to report to the City SSP office.  The suspended young policeman, who was posted at Baghdadi Police Station, was seen posing with his pistol in uniform.  \"Police constable Zeeshan uploaded the video on TikTok in 2023,\" the City SSP said.  \"No officer will be allowed to play with or display weapons [in videos],\" he added.    In view of discipline and work ethics, the authorities took action against the two police constables laying importance on professionalism, especially during duty. Expressing disappointment over the videos by the constables, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) emphasised that the police is a professional institution and directed other police officials that no one is allowed to engage in such irresponsible acts.  He warned that any police personnel found posing with their weapons and uploading these videos or images will be suspended and a departmental action will be carried out against them.  It may be noted that the government earlier in the day issued directives barring all public servants from using social media without permission to prevent disclosure of official information and documents. According to an office memorandum issued by the Establishment Division, government employees have been legally bound to adhere to the instruction under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964. In the wake of the order, government servants will no longer be allowed to use any social media application without permission."

  "content": "  ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on Tuesday filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to stop his potential military trial in connection with the May 9 cases. The plea filed under Article 199 of the Constitution comes amid speculations about a military trial of the deposed prime minister trial in a military court.  Last week, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar said that if needed, the Punjab government would decide to refer the PTI founder’s case to a military court. “The prosecution of May 9 cases is being done by the Punjab government and the provincial government will decide to refer the case to a military court,” The News quoted him as saying in an informal talk with media persons on August 29.  Similarly, responding to the PTI founder's demand for an \"open trial\" of ex-spymaster General (retd) Faiz Hamid last month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif hinted at the possibility of the deposed prime minister's trial in a military court for the May 9 riots. Violent protests broke out across the country after the cricketer-turned-politician was arrested from the premises of IHC in a graft case on May 9, 2023. Amid the protests, the alleged PTI supporters vandalised military installations including General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and engaged in arson at the Lahore Corps Commander House. After receiving Khan's plea, the IHC registrar's office raised objections on it:   It may be noted that the apex court in December 2023, in a 5:1 majority verdict suspended its October 23, 2023 order wherein it declared civilians' trials in military courts null and void in connection with the May 9 riots. The verdict was announced on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry against the top court's verdict announced by Justice Ijazul Ahsan-led bench earlier that year.  The December 13 order stated that military court trials would be conditioned on the Supreme Court's final verdict on the intra-court pleas. Speaking to media, Khan's counsel Intezar Panjutha said that they spoke to the PTI founder about his plea in the IHC. The lawyer quoted the former premier as saying: \"Nothing is more crucial that an ex-prime minister is being dragged to a military court. How can the leader of a popular political party be taken to a military court.\" Panjutha further stated that a civilian cannot be tried in a military court in the light of a Supreme Court verdict. "

  "content": "  ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has excused itself from providing relevant information to the Senate's Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs regarding its internal expenses and overall expenditures on the February 8 nationwide polls. The Senate body's session was held under the chair of Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand on Tuesday sought details of the salaries of the ECP members and employees, as well as their travel expenses and the expenditures for the 2024 general elections. However, ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan sent a letter to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, a copy of which is available with Geo News, stating that the upper house's standing committee was exceeding its jurisdiction by questioning the commission's expenditures \"which is 'charged' against Federal Consolidated Fund\". \"ECP is not obliged to provide the requisite information,\" the commission's secretary stated in a letter, saying that it is an \"independent constitutional body\" unlike other ministries, divisions, and its associated public bodies. It added that the poll organising authority was neither representing the federal government nor any provincial government and is therefore, outside the purview of the Senate body on parliamentary affairs. \"Accordingly, the budget allocated to the Election Commission is not voted in the National Assembly for inclusion in the Annual Budget Statement as provided in Article 82(1) ibid,\" it read. The ECP also stated that it is ready to assist the parliamentary body on legislative business pertaining to the election laws and constitutional provisions, as per its defined role. Responding to the letter, the committee chairman Senator Mohmand lamented that the ECP was stating that it was not answerable to parliament that \"established it\". The chairman added that the Senate body, as per the rules, has powers to summon any individual including the chief election commissioner (CEC) and ECP officials besides reviewing documents and records. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Mohsin Aziz demanded the Senate body to reject the ECP's letter and reminded that the commission's representatives had appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in the past. To this, parliamentary affairs' secretary said that the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs was only authorised to look into legislative affairs of the ECP and suggested that guidance should be sought from the Senate chairman on the matter. In November 2022, the commission had approved over Rs47 billion for organising general polls. However, the cost of holding nationwide polls in phases soared to Rs61.805 billion from Rs47.417 billion, with an additional amount of Rs14.388 billion sought by the commission from the Finance Ministry in January last year, The News had reported."

  "content": " A militant belonging to outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Rooh Ullah, has revealed that suicide bombers were administered injections to desensitise them two days before their departure for the terror attacks.  In a video statement, the detained terrorist made revelations about his and other suicide bombers' training in a seminary in Afghanistan and how they infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border via facilitators. He was caught by security forces who along with other suicide bombers illegally crossed the Afghan border to enter Pakistan to carry out bombings in a cantonment area. However, the terror plot was foiled by security personnel via timely action. The terrorist, in his statement, said that he was a student of a seminary — Tarteel-ul-Quran — in Tortam village in Afghanistan's Dangam for one year. He said that the seminary gives training to suicide bombers and he also received training for 10 days. Molvi Sibghatullah along with Farooq and Zakir taught them about suicide bombings in the seminary, said Rooh Ullah. He also revealed that injections were administered to the attackers two days before their departure [for the missions] to numb them, after which they could no longer comprehend what was happening around them. After the completion of their training, Rooh Ullah along with four others were transported to Batish village of Nari district in a green-coloured vehicle and later they started travelling to the Afghan border. He said that a facilitator namely Jawad received the group of suicide bombers who helped them to enter Pakistani territory and after that,  responsibility for the group's next destination was handed over to another man — Sajjad. According to the arrested terrorist, two suicide bombers including Sajid and Abid were separated from them and Sajjad took him to a mosque.  The handler had instructed him to meet another person Suleman on a bridge. After travelling for one hour, they reached a tunnel where he and Suleman separated again. He said that Suleman had asked him to receive a suicide vest from Jameel who would also guide him about carrying out an attack in a cantonment area. He further said that he was given directions to ride a truck but he was immediately arrested by security forces after entering the vehicle.  However, he did not disclose details of which areas they were going to target and from where he got arrested in a raid. Pakistan witnessed a surge in terror activities over the past few months, particularly in its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan provinces, for which the government and military blamed the terrorists operating from Afghan soil to launch cross-border attacks inside the country. Islamabad has time and again urged the Kabul administration to take decisive action against the terror outfits involved in targeting security forces and civilians in Pakistan.  The federal government, intending to cope with rising terrorism, including cross-border infiltration, launched operation \"Azm-e-Istehkam,\" a renewed national anti-terror drive as part of the National Action Plan earlier this year in June. In another move to shift its war on terror from a physical to an ideological front, the government had categorised the outlawed TTP as \"Fitna al-Khawarij\" in July. The government also made it mandatory for all institutions to use \"Khariji\" before the names of perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan, according to a notification issued by the Ministry of Interior. According to the notification, titles such as 'Mufti' and 'Hafiz' will not be used for individuals associated with terrorist organisations, while in all correspondence and documents, the term \"Khariji\" will be written and read before their names."

According to a...",
  "content": "LONDON: Dubai-based business tycoon Umar Farooq Zahoor has sued Norwegian right-wing Verdens Gang (VG) tabloid and its reporter Rolf John Wideroe for publishing a defamatory article. According to a copy of the defamation lawsuit notice sent to the paper over an article by Wideroe, Zahoor’s lawyers have accused the paper of Islamophobia, racism and xenophobia for making several false allegations. Hilal-e-Imtiaz: The legal notice/suit states that the \"name of our client Umar Farooq Zahoor has been approved for conferment of civil award Hilal-e-Imtiaz by the president of Pakistan in acknowledgment of his efforts and meritorious services in bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in country as direct foreign investment.” Racism and Islamophobia: Zahoor’s lawyers have accused the right-wing tabloid of targeting the businessman “with malicious intent for the last fifteen years by publishing defamatory articles”. The notice says that \"the main reason for orchestrating this false campaign is Islamophobia, racism and your personal score against our client. That article in question is an ongoing onslaught by your tabloid against our client in order to tarnish his reputation, dignity, honour, business and social status on account of racism, settling personal score and for illegal/unlawful purposes”. The lawsuit elaborates: “In your article, you have also mentioned the Medal of Honours awarded to our client by the President of Equatorial Guinea in Africa in recognition of his services for opening of the power plant in August 2023. At the same time you have levelled corruption allegations against the said president. This foiled attempt on your part to link conferment of two awards on our client amidst allegations of corruption and fraud reflects mala fide and deliberate effort to defame our client.... It is clear beyond any doubt that your tabloid is raising false allegations against our client without any proof and the same is defamatory.” Nordea Bank case facts: Zahoor’s lawyers have highlighted that the tabloid’s personalised campaign is biased and Islamophobic as it has deliberately hidden key facts while attacking Zahoor.  The lawsuit has rejected allegations of fraud by Zahoor in the Nordea Bank Norway fraud case. It says the Norwegian-born Zahoor moved to Dubai around 20 years ago in 2005 and that \"a case was registered at Norway in the year 2010 wherein certain officials of Nordea Bank of Norway in collusion with some private persons fraudulently deprived one Randi Nelson of a colossal sum of money and transferred the said amount to the Banks in UAE and Norway. It is worth mentioning here that our client has never been to Norway since 2005 whereas the alleged occurrence took place in the year 2010. The Law Enforcement Agencies of Norway initially initiated the investigation in the year 2011. The persons involved in the crime were prosecuted in Norway and some were punished and some of them were acquitted\". UAE turns down request: The notice further says that \"our client was also made part of investigation for merely having connection with the persons at UAE allegedly involved in the said fraud and due to passing by remarks of the judge who conducted the trial of Nordea Bank fraud. The aforesaid remarks were passed without any proof of involvement of our client in the fraud. It was for this reason that the decision and remarks of the Judge were turned over by the Appellate Court. The investigation initiated against our client was closed in the year 2013 due to lack of evidence. It is astonishing that neither the news of closure of investigation nor the turning over of the remarks of Trial Judge was reported by your tabloid.” INTERPOL warrant vacated: The defamation lawsuit says that the Norwegian authorities reopened the investigation in 2015 and obtained a red warrant for Zahoor from INTERPOL but the Law Enforcement Agency at the UAE refused to hand Zahoor over to the Norwegian authorities as the Norway prosecution failed to provide any evidence regarding his involvement in the alleged crime.  The lawsuit says: “INTERPOL reviewed the case of Umar Farooq Zahoor in its 110th Session held from 30th Sept 2019 to 4th Oct 2019 and ordered deletion of his Red Warrants after thoroughly probing into allegations in the light of evidence submitted by Norwegian authorities. The said decision of INTERPOL was accepted by the Norwegian authorities which is still intact.\" Norway case vindication: “However, Umar Farooq Zahoor joined the investigation in good faith and eventually the investigation was closed for good. Same has been verified by the Norway Police vide its letter dated 20.05.2020. The Oslo Police Department also sent the proposal for closure of the aforesaid case vide Letter dated 20.12.2021 to the Public Prosecutor Office Oslo.” Judge Arild Nesdal’s porn conviction: The lawsuit says that the tabloid VG deliberately did not tell its readers that the Presiding Judicial Officer namely Arild Nesdal who gave passing remarks against Umar Farooq Zahoor, relied upon by the tabloid, while awarding sentence to one of the accused in the alleged fraud has himself been convicted in child pornography offences.  The lawsuit says that Wideroe is aware of the grave nature of the crime but the tabloid intentionally concealed this important fact while covering the Nordea Bank case. Vindication in Pakistan: The lawsuit says that Shehzad Akbar, ex-advisor to former PM Imran Khan on accountability, in connivance with Zahoor’s ex-wife Khushbakht Mirza again opened the same case in Pakistan. Zahoor’s lawyers have said in the lawsuit that: “It is also noteworthy that the case was registered against our client without following due process of law and the approval was obtained from the PTI Govt Cabinet by concealing the facts and a First Information Report (FIR) No 40/20 was registered on the same facts which had already been investigated multiple times in Norway and every time case was closed due to lack of evidence. Upon learning about the FIR, Mr Zahoor joined the investigation and a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was formed by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). The JIT after a thorough investigation recommended the cancellation of the FIR. In the light thereof, the Learned Court at Pakistan vide its Order dated 11.05.2023 was pleased to cancel the FIR and acquitted our client. These facts prove that allegations of fraud against our client are a bunch of lies and our client has been vindicated at last in two jurisdictions.” False police case: The suit also reveals that the Norwegian tabloid registered a criminal case against Zahoor on allegations of threatening the tabloid but the case has also been dismissed by the Oslo Police after thorough probe vide notification dated 23.03.2023. “It is beyond imagination how our client can threaten your tabloid while not being in Norway\". Proclaimed offender: The lawsuit says Wideroe has been a proclaimed offender in Pakistan since 2015. “A criminal case bearing No 222/2015 was registered against him for depriving a Pakistani citizen Maqsood Ali of ten million rupees by making a false promise of getting him a Norwegian passport during his visit to Nawabshah, Pakistan.  It says: “After receiving hefty payment Mr Rolf J Wideroe firstly threatened Mr Maqsood Ali of dire consequences and finally managed to flee from Pakistan. The Law Enforcement Agency managed to secure non-bailable arrest warrants of Mr Rolf J Wideroe from the competent court of law. Subsequently, request for issuance of Red Warrants was made for Mr Rolf J Wideroe. He is still absconding from the process of law and [is] wanted by the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan. Your tabloid is continuously publishing stories of a proclaimed offender who intentionally distorts and conceals facts for his own personal gains.” Ghana’s gas turbine case: The lawsuit says that the tabloid referred to Ghana’s gas turbine case and again failed to mention the facts of the matter, mainly that the gas deal has already been audited by different independent authorities and has been declared as beneficial for the state of Ghana. It says: “In response to [the] hue and cry made by your tabloid regarding alleged corruption in the gas turbine project, the Government of Ghana ordered an independent audit of the deal and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC ) was engaged for the said purpose. The PWC after a complete audit cleared the deal. Similarly, opinion was sought from the Attorney General’s office of Ghana regarding the said deal who also declared the deal to be the beneficial one. The concealment of these important facts makes it abundantly clear that your tabloid is only publishing limited information just in order to malign our client.”  The lawsuit asks the tabloid to “immediately withdraw your article published against our client and publish an official apology” for “defaming our client through misreporting and distorting facts”, adding that \"in case of failure to do so, we have instructions from our client to initiate criminal as well as civil action against your tabloid and your reporter at all the appropriate forums.” The lawsuit adds that Umar Farooq Zahoor \"has an impeccable reputation in different business and social circles for his business, social and philanthropy work. He enjoys respect in the diplomatic community as well...\""

  "content": "  RAWALPINDI: Amid a spike in terror incidents, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the military’s top commanders on Tuesday reviewed the threats posed by \"inimical forces\" and vowed that the Pakistan Army would not allow hard-earned gains against terrorism to be reversed. A resolve to this effect was agreed upon during the Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, presided over by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). In assessing the inimical forces, malicious actors, subversive proxies, and the facilitators of Pakistan’s external and internal adversaries, particularly those active in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the top commanders deliberated on a range of measures to neutralise these threats.  “The forum reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the people, will not allow the hard-earned successes against terrorism to be reversed,” it added. Pakistan's armed forces launched intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in the southwestern Balochistan province in response to attacks by insurgents that martyred over 50 people on August 26, the ISPR said last week. The military’s media wing said 21 insurgents were killed and three others wounded in the three operations launched in the province. \"Operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these atrocious acts are brought to justice,\" the army had said in a statement. Moreover, security forces neutralised at least 12 terrorists in IBOs conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Tirah Valley, according to ISPR. \"Since August 20, 2024, security forces are conducting extensive IBOs in Tirah Valley, Khyber District, on the reported presence of Khwarij,\" the ISPR said in a statement. During the meeting, the military top brass emphasised that the army was a disciplined institution, upholding the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and loyalty to the state and institution.  “The institution's well-established and rigorous system of accountability ensures that these values are preserved with unwavering commitment, allowing no room for exceptions or partiality,” the meeting stressed, adding, “This strict adherence to accountability fortifies the Army’s integrity, ensuring that no individual is above the law or exempt from scrutiny.” Recognising the urgency and significance of a robust and effective legal system, the COAS emphasised that the Pakistan Army would continue to extend comprehensive support to the government, administrative apparatus, and law enforcement agencies in taking swift and lawful action against terrorists, anarchists, and criminal mafias.  The forum expressed satisfaction over ongoing efforts against illegal spectrum operating in collusion with terrorist networks, underscoring the critical need to safeguard national cyberspace through stringent cyber-security measures. In a show of solidarity with the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), who continue to suffer gross human rights violations, the forum honoured the martyrs of the freedom movement. The blatant continued violence and genocide of Palestinians by Israel were also condemned in the strongest terms. The forum expressed confidence in the operational preparedness and readiness of the Pakistan Army and vowed to continue to uphold the standards in pursuit of professional excellence, according to the ISPR."

  "content": " ISLAMABAD: A bill seeking an increase in the number of judges in the Supreme Court was tabled in the National Assembly on Tuesday, a day after the similar bill was introduced in the Senate. A day earlier, 'The Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Bill, 2024' was introduced by independent Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir in the upper house to increase the number of apex court judges to 21. In the bill tabled today in the lower house, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) parliamentarian Daniyal Chaudhry called for increasing the number of judges to 23. The statement and objects and reasons of the bill tabled in the Senate say that increasing the number of judges in the apex court is important because it deals with a significant backlog of cases.  The proposed legislation was met with criticism from PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan in today's NA session, who said that such an amendment could be brought only by the government as per the Constitution of Pakistan. \"Legislation on the number of Supreme Court judges cannot be done through a private member bill,\" Khan said. The PTI lawmaker said that the country's top court works 155 days of the year compared to India's apex court, which works 190 days of the year. \"We should increase the Supreme Court's working days to address the rising number of pending cases,\" he added. Speaking on the floor of the assembly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar concurred with the PTI chief’s suggestion to increase the number of top court’s working days, saying that the duration of the apex court judges’ annual holidays should be curtailed. He said that formerly the judges used to embark on long ship voyages to Britain so the apex courts had 60 days holidays twice a year. \"Now these holidays should be reduced,\" he said, adding that the number of apex court judges is still 17 while the population of Pakistan has soared to over 240 million. He, however, revealed that the government has not yet made a final decision on increasing the number of Supreme Court judges and the matter will be decided after a detailed deliberation."

  "content": "Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal on Tuesday resigned as the National Assembly member over the worsening situation in the province, declaring no confidence in the state, the president and the prime minister.  \"I announce my resignation from the Assembly today. I made this decision after witnessing the situation of Balochistan,\" said Mengal during the National Assembly session.  Regretting the he could not do anything for the people of the province, the politician said they have not been given the right to rule for a year and that he has lack of trust in the whole system. \"People are not interested in the issues of Balochistan and everytime this issue is raised, we face a blackout,\" he said. \"This assembly does not listen to us, what's the point of sitting here?\" Speaking to Geo News, Mengal said that the decision is made by his conscience. He questioned where they would go when the roads to the Parliament are all blocked.  Mengal, who is the member of NA-256, said the prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled him to take this step.  \"Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further to the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles. The lack of genuine representation in this assembly for the people of Balochistan have left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change,\" said the resignation letter.  Mengal said that their attempts to speak or protest are \"met with hostility. Our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed.\"  \"I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,\" he said. The politician's decision comes in the wake of the province's worsening law and order situation. Balochistan, on August 26, was marred by a series of horrific attacks that resulted in over 50 deaths, including 14 security personnel, as militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted civilians, police, and security forces. In one of the deadliest attacks, at least 23 passengers were killed after being offloaded from passenger buses and trucks in the Rarasham area of Balochistan's Musakhel. Separately, at least 10 people, including police and Levies personnel, were martyred in a gun attack in Kalat. Furthermore, at least 14 brave sons of soil, including 10 security forces soldiers and four personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs), were martyred in clearance operations, wherein at least 21 militants were neutralised."
